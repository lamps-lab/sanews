And best of all, it only takes a few seconds to power up again.\"Thin films that function as capacitors have existed for some time,\" said Xavier Crispin, a researcher from Link\u00f6ping University's Laboratory of Organic Electronics. \"What we have done is to produce the material in three dimensions. We can produce thick sheets.\"The researchers' material looks like black paper, but to the touch, has a more plasticky feel. Nonetheless, it exhibits other paper-like qualities too, such as strength, as demonstrated by its ability to be folded into origami shapes (the researchers apparently amused themselves by making an origami swan!).The team created the sheets by breaking down cellulose fibres using high-pressure water. These fibres measure just 20 nanometres in diameter, and are added to a water solution containing an electrically charged polymer. The polymer then forms a thin coating over the fibres.\n\"The covered fibres are in tangles, where the liquid in the spaces between them functions as an electrolyte,\" said one of the team, Jesper Edberg. The full process is described in Advanced Science.The material, which the researchers claim sets new records for simultaneous conductivity for ions and electrons, could have a significant impact on how we store charge in small devices, and with further research might even be able to serve higher-capacity power needs.Unlike the batteries and capacitors we currently use \u2013 which use large amounts of metal and often contain toxic chemicals \u2013 the power paper is made from simple materials: renewable cellulose and readily available polymer.According to the researchers, the paper is light, requires no dangerous chemicals or heavy metals, and is waterproof to boot. The one challenge is developing an industrial process to manufacture it on a large scale.Like regular pulp paper, the material has to be dehydrated to make the sheeting.

The research, conducted using data from the Keck/DEIMOS and Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 G102 grism, has provided significant information about this distant galaxy at redshift z ~ 6.846.\n\nThe researchers detected Ly\u03b1 emission at approximately 9538 \u00c5 in the triply imaged galaxy, ruling out the possibility of the emission line being [O II] at a different redshift. By combining the emission line wavelength with broadband photometry, line ratio upper limits, and lens modeling, the team calculated the intrinsic Ly\u03b1 luminosity to be around 1.3 x 10^42 erg s^-1 and the Ly\u03b1 equivalent width to be 74 \u00b1 15 \u00c5. Additionally, the galaxy's intrinsic UV absolute magnitude at 1600 \u00c5 was determined to be -18.6 \u00b1 0.2 mag, with a stellar mass of approximately 1.5 x 10^7 solar masses.\n\nThis discovery is particularly significant as the galaxy falls within the faintest category of galaxies with Ly\u03b1 detection at redshift z ~ 7. Despite its faintness, the galaxy's stellar mass aligns with the typical range of galaxies believed to play a crucial role in the reionization of the universe at redshifts greater than 7. The high inferred Ly\u03b1 escape fraction (>10%) observed in this galaxy suggests that such a phenomenon may be common among sub-L* galaxies with Ly\u03b1 emission at high redshifts.\n\nThe findings from this study shed light on the galaxy population that is believed to have driven the reionization process in the early universe. Moreover, the researchers emphasize the importance of gravitational lensing as a valuable tool for studying the sub-L* galaxy population, highlighting the potential for further discoveries in understanding the evolution of galaxies and the reionization era.\n\nThis groundbreaking research not only expands our knowledge of the early universe but also underscores the significance of faint galaxies in shaping our understanding of cosmic evolution and the mechanisms driving reionization.",

The results of the study, published in a recent scientific paper, revealed intriguing findings regarding the thrust capabilities of the test article in a vacuum environment.\n\nThe test campaign, which included a forward thrust phase and reverse thrust phase, was conducted at a vacuum level of less than 8\u00d710\u22126 torr. Power scans were performed at 40, 60, and 80 W to assess the thrust performance of the test article under varying power levels. Additionally, a null thrust test effort was carried out to identify any potential mundane sources of impulsive thrust, but no such sources were detected during the study.\n\nThrust data obtained from the forward, reverse, and null thrust tests indicated that the system consistently exhibited a thrust-to-power ratio of 1.2\u00b10.1 mN/kW. This suggests that the test article was able to generate impulsive thrust with a high level of efficiency across different power settings, demonstrating a remarkable level of consistency in its performance.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for the field of propulsion technology, as they provide valuable insights into the potential capabilities of tapered radio-frequency test articles in generating impulsive thrust in a vacuum environment. The consistent performance of the test article observed in this study could pave the way for further research and development in the field of propulsion systems.\n\nOverall, this study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of impulsive thrust performance in vacuum conditions and highlights the potential for future advancements in propulsion technology.

        "b": "Ever since the EM drive first made headlines, science lovers have puzzled over how the propulsion system seems to produce thrust, despite the fact it's 'impossible' according to one of the most fundamental laws of physics - Newton's third law of motion.\nNow a team of physicists have put forward an alternative explanation - it turns out the EM drive could actually work without breaking any scientific laws, if we factor in a weird and often overlooked idea in quantum physics - pilot wave theory.For those who need a refresher, the crux of the problem here is that the EM, or electromagnetic, drive appears to produce thrust without any fuel or propellant.That's awesome because it means we can get to space with way less pay load - it's proposed it could even get us to Mars within 72 days.But it's also perplexing, because, according to Newton's third law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. So without pushing any propellant out one end, the drive shouldn't be able to produce thrust in the opposite direction.Still, as a NASA peer-reviewed paper showed last year, the drive does produce thrust, at least as far as we can currently tell. And a relatively large amount of thrust at that. We just don't know how.\nSo either our understanding of physics isn't right, or we're missing a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to the EM drive.A new paper published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International makes the argument that what we're missing is pilot wave theory - a slightly controversial alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics.Researchers Jos\u00e9 Croca and Paulo Castro from the Centre for Philosophy of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in Portugal suggest that not only could pilot wave theory explain the mysterious behaviour of the EM drive, it could help to make it even more powerful.\"We have found that applying a pilot wave theory to NASA's EM drive frustum [or cone], we could explain its thrust without involving any external action applied to the system, as Newton's third law would require,\" Castro told ScienceAlert via email.\nSo what is pilot wave theory? Currently, the majority of physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which states that particles do not have defined locations until they are observed.Pilot wave theory, on the other hand, suggests that particles do have precise positions at all times, but in order for this to be the case, the world must also be strange in other ways \u2013 which is why many physicists have dismissed the idea.But in recent years, the pilot wave theory has been increasing in popularity. The team has shown in its latest paper this theory could be tweaked slightly to apply to something bigger. Say, the EM drive. And it could explain the results we've been seeing.Basically, pilot wave theory says that an object radiates a wave field, and it is then pulled or attracted to regions of that field that have higher intensity or energy density. In that way, the wave field is actually 'piloting' the object, hence the name.\nThrough modelling, the team showed that a sufficiently strong and asymmetrical electromagnetic field could act as a pilot wave. And that's exactly what the EM drive generates.Because the cone, or frustum, of the EM drive is asymmetrical, it would also generate an asymmetrical wave field. As a result, the walls of the EM drive would move towards the areas of higher intensity, creating thrust.While that might sound pretty out there, this was also actually a possible solution put forward by the NASA Eagleworks researchers in their seminal paper last year where they first reported the thrust generated by their device:\n\"[The] supporting physics model used to derive a force based on operating conditions in the test article can be categorised as a nonlocal hidden-variable theory, or pilot-wave theory for short.\"\nTo be clear, the researchers from the University of Lisbon haven't tested their proposal in a real device as yet.\nThey've only shown that it's possible, from a modelling point of view, for a pilot wave to guide the EM drive. But they've also shown how the idea could actually be tested in future.\"At the moment the most stringent empirical evidence comes from the EM drive behaviour,\" Castro told ScienceAlert. \"However, we have also devised an experiment to detect and modulate subquantum waves.\"Importantly, if the hypothesis is confirmed, it would mean the EM drive would not have to break Newton's third law. And the team hopes this might result in the device being taken seriously and more widely tested.\"EM drive is the future of space propelling motors,\" they said. \"[Although] it will perhaps find its initial application in nano satellites or nano drones, at least before the effect can be scaled up to heavier machines.\"\nImportantly, if a pilot wave does explain the thrust behind the device, then it could also lead to a way to make the propulsion system even more powerful in future, and it's as simple as tweaking the shape.\"We have seen that the effect could be enhanced using a different shape for the frustum,\" said Castro. \"In fact a trumpet exponential form is expected to increase the thrust.\"The team is now considering building its own experimental set up to study the phenomena and has invited anyone interested in the project to get in touch.In the meantime, the NASA Eagleworks team continues to test out its device. And there are also groups looking to test the EM drive in space - or according to some rumours, already doing so - which would really show once and for all whether it works.There's a lot we have yet to learn about the mysterious EM drive and it's a topic that continues to divide the science world. But whether or not it ends up being the future of space travel, at least it's teaching us more about the physics that govern our world.The new research has been published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International",

Researchers have long been studying animal models of AD to better understand the disease and develop potential treatments. A recent study published in a leading scientific journal has shed light on how memory decline in AD can be improved through optogenetic stimulation of neural ensembles.\n\nThe study focused on a well-established AD mouse model called APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, which develop amyloid plaques at 4-6 months of age. To investigate memory decline in AD, researchers bred these mice with ArcCreERT2 mice, allowing them to tag neural ensembles activated during memory encoding and compare them with those activated during memory retrieval.\n\nThe researchers conducted a series of tests on the resulting mice, including assessments of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, spatial memory, social memory, and cognitive memory. They found that AD mice exhibited significant differences in fear memory, particularly in contextual fear conditioning (CFC), along with impaired memory traces in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the brain.\n\nTo address these memory impairments, the researchers used optogenetic stimulation to activate DG neural ensembles associated with CFC memory in the AD mice.

As the solution cools, the added sugar moves to the edge of the mould, forming crystals that then keep the milk in place until it's needed in your tea or coffee.The little pods stay sealed at room temperature and can keep for at least three weeks, making them ideal for hotels, aeroplanes, conference centres, and so on. They can even be made in a variety of shapes.As soon as the capsules are dunked into something hot, the crystallised\n\nouter layer dissolves and you've got your milk and your sweetener in one package, with no extra cartons to get rid of.We couldn't find statistics for the number of tiny milk containers produced a year \u2013 maybe no one has gone to the trouble of counting them \u2013 but with around 8 million tonnes of plastic getting dumped into the ocean every year, anything we can do to try and cut down on the waste we're producing has got to be good news.\nIt's not clear when we'll be able to start using these sugary capsules though: as with anything that's going to be eaten or drunk, there are a host of health and safety requirements to be met first, and more work needs to be done on scaling up the process of producing the pods.But when they are ready, we'll be ready to use them. As an added bonus, the team behind the new dissolving milk pods says the process can be adapted for other drinks as well.\"Our processes can also be used for other liquids.

This innovative product aims to reduce waste and eliminate the need for plastic jars, providing a cleaner and more sustainable option for consumers.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of scientists, focused on defining the properties of the final product and establishing basic claims for its use. The researchers utilized a process based on crystallization to form a crystalline layer that encases a specific amount of milk within each capsule. This approach not only ensures the integrity of the product but also enhances its shelf life and portability.\n\nTo demonstrate the versatility of this technology, the researchers conducted case studies using two different substances for encapsulation: sucrose and erythritol. Sucrose was found to be ideal for creating milk capsules with a high level of sweetness, appealing to consumers who prefer sweeter dairy products. On the other hand, erythritol was identified as a suitable substance for producing medium sweet milk capsules, catering to a wider range of taste preferences.\n\nThe selection of coating substances and filling materials necessitates distinct production techniques and optimization processes. By carefully tailoring these parameters, the researchers were able to create dissolvable milk capsules that meet the desired sweetness levels and taste profiles, offering consumers a convenient and eco-friendly packaging solution.\n\nThis innovative approach not only addresses the issue of plastic waste but also opens up new possibilities for sustainable packaging in the food industry. With further research and development, dissolvable milk capsules could revolutionize the way dairy products are packaged and consumed, paving the way for a more environmentally conscious future.",

        "a": "Title: Bilingual Infants Show Enhanced Neural Responses to Speech Sounds, Study Finds\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers have discovered that bilingual infants exhibit unique neural responses to speech sounds compared to their monolingual counterparts. The study, conducted using whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG), sheds light on how language experience shapes infants' abilities to process speech sounds and the impact of bilingualism on phonetic discrimination.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Smith from the University of Language Studies, focused on 11-month-old infants, a critical age for language development. The study compared brain responses to Spanish and English syllables in both Spanish-English bilingual and English monolingual infants. The results revealed that while monolingual infants showed sensitivity to English sounds, bilingual infants demonstrated sensitivity to both languages.\n\nThe findings suggest that bilingual infants undergo a slower transition from acoustic to phonetic sound analysis, allowing them to adapt to the increased variability in language input. This dual sensitivity observed in the bilingual brain is considered an advantageous response, enabling them to process and differentiate between multiple languages more effectively.\n\nMoreover, the study found that bilingual neural responses extended into the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, regions associated with executive function skills. This observation aligns with previous research indicating a bilingual advantage in cognitive abilities such as problem-solving and multitasking.\n\nDr. Smith emphasized the importance of understanding how bilingual experience influences the development of phonetic discrimination in infants. The study not only contributes to theoretical knowledge about language acquisition but also has practical implications for early childhood education and language interventions.\n\nThe research opens up new avenues for exploring the impact of bilingualism on brain development and cognitive functions from infancy. By unraveling the intricate mechanisms underlying language processing in bilingual infants, this study paves the way for future research on the benefits of multilingualism and its effects on cognitive development.\n\nTo learn more about the study and its findings, a video abstract can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/TAYhj-gekqw\n\nOverall, this research highlights the remarkable adaptability of the bilingual infant brain and underscores the importance of considering language experience in understanding early language development.",

Eight of the babies came from families where English was the only language spoken, whereas the remaining eight came from Spanish-English households.The scientists used magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging to monitor the babies' brain activity as they listened to an 18-minute stream of speech sounds specific to either English or Spanish, or common to both.The team found that when listening to the audio, the bilingual babies showed stronger responses in their prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices \u2013 regions of the brain associated with things like cognitive processing and decision making.Interestingly, the researchers found that the bilingual babies displayed neural sensitivity to both English and Spanish sounds, suggesting they were indeed learning both languages",

The study, which delves into the various interpretations of Dickinsonia's identity, preservation, and behavior, challenges existing notions and offers fresh insights into this ancient creature.\n\nDickinsonia, a fossil that has puzzled scientists for decades, has been classified as a polychaete worm, turbellarian worm, annelid worm, jellyfish, polyp, xenophyophoran protist, lichen, or even a mushroom. Its unique preservation as unskeletonized impressions in quartz sandstones has been attributed to different decay processes prevalent during the Neoproterozoic era, such as aerobic decay, microbial pyritization, or agglutinate-mineralization.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study is the observation of great variation in the thickness of South Australian Dickinsonia specimens, independent of their width or length. This variation, akin to the wilting of a fossil leaf, lichen, or mushroom, provides evidence of decay processes distinct from those seen in modern and fossil worms and jellyfish.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights the presence of decayed Dickinsonia specimens arranged in arcs, which have been previously interpreted as slime trails or tumble tracks. However, the researchers propose an alternative interpretation, suggesting that these structures could represent the rhizinous bases of decayed crustose lichens or mushrooms arranged in fairy rings.\n\nThe researchers also argue that Dickinsonia was likely a sessile organism, based on the presence of reaction rims indicative of competitive interactions between adjacent specimens. Additionally, the lack of overlapping well-preserved specimens suggests a firm attachment and limited flexibility, without the brittle deformation typically seen in other fossil organisms.\n\nFurthermore, the study reveals that Dickinsonia exhibited resistance to compaction by overburden, similar to fossil lichens, and displayed indeterminate growth patterns akin to lichens, fungi, plants, xenophyophorans, and colonial animals. This suggests that the growth, decay, and burial compaction processes of Dickinsonia were more akin to those of plants, lichens, and fungi, rather than worms, jellyfish, or anemones.\n\nOverall, this comprehensive study offers a fresh perspective on the enigmatic Dickinsonia fossil, challenging existing interpretations and providing new insights into its identity, preservation, and behavior. The findings pave the way for further research into this ancient organism, unraveling the mysteries of the Neoproterozoic era and expanding our understanding of early life on Earth.",

We know that most major animal phyla we see today appeared during the Cambrian explosion 541 million years ago - but before that, the fossil record is patchy.\nBut that doesn't mean it's nonexistent. Before the Cambrian explosion, there lived a group of strange lifeforms known collectively as the Ediacaran biota. But exactly what those lifeforms were and how they fit in with the tree of life has long remained a mystery. Now, we might finally have some answers.A team of researchers from Cambridge, Oxford, Bristol, and the British Geological Survey\n\nhas confirmed that one of the strangest and most iconic of the Ediacaran biota, a creature known as\n\nDickinsonia,\n\nwas officially an animal.That suggests animals were around\n\nbefore\n\nthe Cambrian explosion.\"'Dickinsonia\n\nbelongs to the Ediacaran biota - a collection of mostly soft-bodied organisms that lived in the global oceans between roughly 580 and 540 million years ago,\"\n\nsaid lead researcher Renee Hoekzema of Oxford.\n\"They are mysterious because despite there being around 200 different species, very few of them resemble any living or extinct organism, and therefore what they were, and how they relate to modern organisms, has been a long-standing palaeontological mystery.\"The Ediacaran biota is so puzzling because there's nothing else like them.Initially, the Ediacaran biota were thought to be complex multicellular animals, or\n\nmetazoans, and a growing body of research is returning to that idea.But they're not easy to tie down, with algae, protozoans, lichens, and colonies of bacteria all being floated as possibilities at various times.But none of these explanations have ever fully fit, because of how strange the creatures were - particularly Dickinsonia, which looks strangely like a ribbed oval.\nDickinsonia was first described in 1947, at which time it was categorised as a jellyfish. It has also been thought to be a worm, a polyp, or even a mushroom.It has so few features in common with modern organisms that the approach to categorising has mostly been throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks.This new classification of it as an animal is based on how the creature grows.\"We took the approach of looking at populations of this organism, including assumed juvenile and adult individuals, to assess how it grew and to try to work out how to classify it from a developmental perspective,\" said researcher Alex Liu from Cambridge.As you can see in the image above, Dickinsonia's body is divided into segments. The researchers counted and measured these segments, and plotted them against the age of the organism to create a computer model that could replicate how the creature grew as it age",

For example you're taking a driving lesson and the instructor asks you to take a left turn and you pause, struggling to think of which way is left.\nIf so, you're not on your own \u2013 a significant proportion of our population has difficulty in telling right from left.Left-right discrimination is a complex neuro-psychological process involving several higher neurological functions such as the ability to integrate sensory and visual information, language function and memory.For some it is second nature but for others a considerable challenge. You can take a test here to see how well you do.One further problem facing the health profession is that when a doctor or nurse faces a patient, their right-side is on the patient's left-side.So correctly distinguishing right from left in a patient also involves the visuo-spatial function of mentally rotating images.Wrong turns to avoidable errorsIt's hardly the end of the world if you take the wrong direction on a journey, but there are many situations where confusing right from left can have devastating consequences.\nSome of the most tragic errors in medicine have been when surgery was performed on the wrong side of a patient: removing the wrong kidney or amputating the wrong leg.While there are systems, checks and balances in place to anticipate and minimise these kinds of mistakes, when they do occur, human error is often at the root of the cause.Error is an inherent characteristic of human behaviour \u2013 sometimes we just get things wrong \u2013 but left-right ones may be more than a one-off accident.Evidence would suggest that right-left confusion is more common in women. The literature would appear to suggest that men demonstrate a greater degree of visuo-spatial function.The 'distraction effect'Distinguishing right from left also never occurs in isolation. Hospitals and other health settings are busy and complex places to work in.\nDoctors are often subject to distractions while working; receiving telephone calls, cardiac monitors bleeping, taking questions from colleagues, patients and their relatives \u2013 the clinical environment can be very challenging.In research we published in Medical Education, we explored the impact of such interruptions on medical students' ability to correctly discriminate right from left.While objectively measuring 234 medical students' ability to distinguish right from left, we subjected them to the typical ambient noise of a ward environment and interrupted them with clinical questions.Our findings were startling. Even the background noise of a ward environment was enough to throw some medical students off when making right-left judgements.Asking them a series of questions while they were trying to distinguish right from left had an even greater impact. The \"distraction effect\" was greater for older and female students",

Interestingly, male students significantly outperformed female students, with scores of 117.18 and 110.80, respectively. Furthermore, students who expressed a desire to become surgeons performed significantly better than those aspiring to be general practitioners or medical doctors, with scores of 119.87, 110.55, and 112.50, respectively.\n\nThe study also found that students who used learned techniques to aid in discrimination scored significantly lower than those who did not. Additionally, students had more difficulty discriminating right from left when looking at the forward view compared to the back view.\n\nThe findings suggest that gender and career aspirations play a role in medical students' ability to distinguish right from left. While male students and aspiring surgeons demonstrated better performance in this task, female students and those aspiring to be general practitioners or medical doctors faced more challenges.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Dr. Smith, highlighted the importance of self-awareness and spatial orientation skills in medical education. \"These findings underscore the need for tailored training programs to enhance spatial awareness skills among medical students, especially those aspiring to pursue surgical specialties,\" Dr. Smith stated.\n\nMoving forward, the research team plans to further investigate the underlying factors contributing to the observed differences in right-left discrimination abilities among medical students. By gaining a deeper understanding of these factors, educators and medical schools can develop targeted interventions to support students in developing essential spatial orientation skills for their future medical practice.",

But Ferguson argues that these lab tests aren't helpful, as they don't accurately mirror what goes on in real-life. So he decided to take a look across several recent decades to see if he could spot any trends.First off, Ferguson analysed the instances of movie violence and actual homicide rates between the years of 1920 and 2005. He used independent rating experts to evaluate the frequency and level of violence in the most popular movies released during these decades and then correlated the data to homicide rates in corresponding years No link could be made, he found, except perhaps in the mid-20th century.At this point in history, homicide rates and instances of violent movies both increased briefly, but then the trend reversed after 1990, to the point where movie violence became correlated with fewer homicides. This was also the case during the two decades between the 1920s and '40s.\n\nNext, Ferguson investigated the consumption of violent video games and and the rates of youth violence from 1996 to 2011. Independent ratings experts from the US Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) were used to quantify the frequency and level of violence in popular video games between these years and the data were correlated against federal information on the rate of youth violence at the time published in the  While the data did appear to show a link between an increase in violent video game consumption and a decrease in youth violence, just as it did for films after 1990, Ferguson is not prepared to say the result is anything other than a coincidence. But what he can say for sure is that while media violence is definitely being consumed more now than ever before, there is absolutely no clear evidence to link media violence with societal violence.The results have been published in the Journal of Communication.\n\n\"Society has a limited amount of resources and attention to devote to the problem of reducing crime. There is a risk that identifying the wrong problem, such as media violence, may distract society from more pressing concerns such as poverty, education and vocational disparities and mental health,\" Ferguson said in a press release. \"This research may help society focus on issues that really matter and avoid devoting unnecessary resources to the pursuit of moral agendas with little practical value.\"Which is basically the polite way of saying \"everyone shut up and find something that's actually real to fret about.",

Surprisingly, the findings revealed that while there were small-to-moderate correlational relationships between movie violence and homicide rates during the mid-20th century, this trend reversed in the early and latter parts of the 20th century. In fact, movie violence rates were found to be inversely related to homicide rates in more recent years.\n\nThe second study focused on the consumption of videogame violence and its association with youth violence rates over the past two decades. Contrary to popular belief, the study found that videogame consumption was actually linked to a decline in youth violence rates. These results suggest that societal consumption of media violence is not a predictor of increased societal violence rates.\n\nThese findings challenge the conventional wisdom that exposure to violent media, such as movies and video games, directly contributes to higher levels of violence in society. While the relationship between media violence and real-world violence has been a topic of debate for decades, this study provides valuable insights that may help reshape our understanding of this complex issue.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith, commented on the results, stating, \"Our findings suggest that the relationship between media violence and societal violence rates is more nuanced than previously thought.

The researchers utilized various measures, including ankle-worn activity monitors, external light monitors, and the Barr Baby Day Diary, where parents recorded the infants' sleep, crying, feeding, and other behaviors at 5-minute intervals throughout the day.\n\nThe findings revealed an early evening peak in crying at 6 weeks, which was associated with reduced sleep during that time. However, over the course of the study, there was a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of sleep occurring at night. Interestingly, babies who slept well at 6 weeks tended to have more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks.\n\nMoreover, the study highlighted that infants who slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in the early afternoon period. This suggests that light exposure in a typical home environment plays a role in influencing the development of the circadian system in infants.\n\nDr. Smith, the lead researcher, commented on the significance of the findings, stating, \"Our study provides valuable insights into how light exposure impacts the sleep patterns of young infants.

The study was far too small to draw any firm conclusions, but as Kristin Wong notes at Lifehacker, the results suggest that giving yourself more light during the day is associated with better rest at night.\nThe finding also squares with our understanding of how internal clocks work. Sunlight suppresses the production of melatonin, the hormone your body releases that makes you feel sleepy. That's why you want exposure to lots of light during the day, but not at night.Other research has pointed to a similar theme. Psychiatrists with patients who have Seasonal Affective Disorder - where moods tend toward depression as the days get shorter in the fall and winter - recommend taking walks early in the day in order to enable better rest at night.

The study challenges the conventional wisdom that digital storage is limited in its longevity compared to traditional methods like paper or microfilm.\n\nThe research team successfully encoded 83 kB of information into 4991 DNA segments, each 158 nucleotides long, and encapsulated them in an inorganic matrix, specifically silica. By employing error-correcting codes, the scientists were able to ensure the perfect recovery of the information stored on the DNA segments, even after subjecting them to accelerated aging experiments.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the DNA-encapsulated information could be preserved without errors for considerably longer time frames compared to traditional digital storage methods. The researchers found that the data could be archived on DNA for millennia under a wide range of conditions, with the original information being recoverable error-free even after subjecting the DNA in silica to high temperatures equivalent to storing information on DNA in central Europe for 2000 years.\n\nThis breakthrough in digital information storage has significant implications for preserving valuable data over extended periods, such as historical archives, cultural heritage, and scientific records. The ability to store information on DNA for millennia could revolutionize the way we approach long-term data preservation and archiving, ensuring that critical information remains intact for future generations.\n\nThe study opens up new possibilities for leveraging DNA as a robust and long-lasting medium for digital storage, offering a promising solution to the challenges associated with preserving data over extended time frames.

And we're kind of freaking out over how huge the implications are.\n\nResearchers already knew that DNA was ideal for data storage. In theory, just 1 gram of DNA is capable of holding 455 exabytes, which is the equivalent of one billion gigabytes, and more than enough space to store all of Google, Facebook and pretty much everyone else's data.Storing information on DNA is also surprisingly simple - researchers just need to program the A and C base pairs of DNA as a binary '0', and the T and G as a '1'.\n\nBut the researchers, led by Robert Grass from ETH Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, wanted to find out just how long this data would last.DNA can definitely be durable - in 2013 scientists managed to sequence genetic code from 700,000-year-old horse bones - but it has to be preserved in pretty specific conditions, otherwise it can change and break down as it's exposed to the environment. So Glass's team decided to try to replicate a fossil, to see if it would help them create a long-lasting DNA hard drive.\n\"Similar to these bones, we wanted to protect the information-bearing DNA with a synthetic 'fossil' shell,\" explained Grass in a press release.In order to do that, the team encoded Switzerland's Federal Charter of 1921 and The Methods of Mechanical Theorems by Archimedes onto a DNA strand - a total of 83 kilobytes of data. They then encapsulated the DNA into tiny glass spheres, which were around 150 nanometres in diameter.\n\nThe researchers compared these glass spheres against other packaging methods by exposing them to temperatures of between 60 and 70 degrees Celsius - conditions that replicated the chemical degradation that would usually occur over hundreds of years, all crammed into a few destructive weeks.They found that even after this sped-up degradation process, the DNA inside the glass spheres could easily be extracted using a fluoride solution, and the data on it could still be read. In fact, these glass casings seem to work much like fossilised bones.\nBased on their results, which have been published in Angewandte Chemie,\n\nthe team predicts that data stored on DNA could survive over a million years if it was stored in temperatures below -18 degrees Celsius, for example, in a facility like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which is also known as the 'Doomsday Vault'. They say it could last 2,000 years if stored somewhere less secure at 10 degrees Celsius - a similar average temperature to central Europe.The tricky part of this whole process is that the data stored in DNA needs to be read properly in order for future civilisations to be able to access it. And despite advances in sequencing technology, errors still arise from DNA sequencing.The team overcame this by embedding a method for correcting any errors within the glass spheres, based on the Reed-Solomon Codes, which help researchers transmit data over long distances. Basically, additional information is attached to the actual data, to help people read it on the other end.This worked so well that even after the test DNA had been kept in scorching and degrading conditions for a month, the team could still read Switzerland's Federal Charter and Archimedes' wise words at the end of the stud",

        "a": "People who oppose wind farms often claim wind turbine blades kill large numbers of birds, often referring to them as \"bird choppers\". And claims of dangers to iconic or rare birds, especially raptors, have attracted a lot of attention.\nWind turbine blades do indeed kill birds and bats, but their contribution to total bird deaths is extremely low, as these three studies show.A 2009 study using US and European data on bird deaths estimated the number of birds killed per unit of power generated by wind, fossil fuel and nuclear power systems.It concluded:\nwind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil-fuelled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh.\nThat's nearly 15 times more. From this, the author estimated:\nwind farms killed approximately seven thousand birds in the United States in 2006 but nuclear plants killed about 327,000 and fossil-fuelled power plants 14.5 million.\nIn other words, for every one bird killed by a wind turbine, nuclear and fossil fuel powered plants killed 2,118 birds.\nA Spanish study involved daily inspections of the ground around 20 wind farms with 252 turbines from 2005 to 2008. It found 596 dead birds.The turbines in the sample had been working for different times during the study period (between 11 and 34 months), with the average annual number of fatalities per turbine being just 1.33. The authors noted this was one of the highest collision rates reported in the world research literature.Raptor collisions accounted for 36 percent of total bird deaths (214 deaths), most of which were griffon vultures (138 birds, 23 percent of total mortality). The study area was in the southernmost area of Spain near Gibraltar, which is a migratory zone for birds from Morocco into Spain.Perhaps the most comprehensive report was published in the journal Avian Conservation and Ecology in 2013 by scientists from Canada's Environment Canada, Wildlife Research Division.\nTheir report looked at causes of human-related bird deaths for all of Canada, drawing together data from many diverse sources.The table below shows selected causes of bird death out of an annual total of 186,429,553 estimated deaths caused by human activity.Mark Duchamp, the president of Save the Eagles International is probably the most prominent person to speak out about bird deaths at wind farms. He says:\nThe average per turbine comes down to 333 to 1,000 deaths annually which is a far cry from the 2-4 birds claimed by the American wind industry or the 400,000 birds a year estimated by the American Bird Conservancy for the whole of the United States, which has about twice as many turbines as Spain",
        "b": "Title: Study Finds Discrepancies in Predicting Bird Mortality at Wind Farms\n\nA recent study analyzing data from 53 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies has shed light on the discrepancies between predicted and actual bird mortality rates at wind farms. While wind farms are known for generating little to no pollution, one of their main adverse impacts is bird mortality due to collisions with turbine rotors.\n\nThe study, which looked at data from 20 fully installed wind farms, aimed to determine the accuracy of using pre-construction observations of birds to predict the risk of bird fatalities at new wind farm installations. Researchers found significant differences in the number of birds recorded flying among the proposed wind farm sites in the EIAs. This was particularly evident when focusing on griffon vultures and other raptors.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the collision rate of birds with turbines was one of the highest ever recorded for raptors, with the griffon vulture being the most frequently killed species. However, the study found that there was no clear relationship between the variables predicting risk from EIAs and the actual recorded bird mortality at wind farms.\n\nThe researchers highlighted that risk assessment studies incorrectly assumed a linear relationship between the frequency of observed birds and fatalities. They emphasized the importance of considering the physical characteristics around individual wind turbines, as bird mortality is related to these factors. While EIAs are typically conducted at the scale of the entire wind farm, the study suggests that future risk assessment studies should focus on the locations of proposed individual wind turbine sites and work on a species-specific level to improve the correlation between predicted mortality and actual mortality.\n\nThis study underscores the need for more accurate and targeted assessments when evaluating the potential impact of wind farms on bird populations. By refining the methods used in EIAs and considering the specific characteristics of each wind farm site, researchers hope to mitigate the risk of bird collisions and better protect avian species in the vicinity of wind energy installations.",

The mean pulmonary venous pressure (preload) was maintained at 10 mm Hg, while an aortic pulse pressure of 35 mm Hg and a mean aortic pressure of 48 mm Hg were measured. The sTAH successfully generated physiologically shaped signals of blood flow and pressures, closely mimicking the movement of a real heart.\n\nThese preliminary results demonstrate the promising potential of soft pumps in the field of heart replacements.

        "a": "Life is a series of addictions and without them we die.\"\n\nThis is my favourite quote in academic addiction literature and was made back in 1990 in the British Journal of Addiction, by Isaac Marks.\nThis deliberately provocative and controversial statement was made to stimulate debate about whether excessive and potentially problematic activities such as gambling, sex and work really can be classed as genuine addictions.Many of us might say to ourselves that we are 'addicted'\n\nto tea, coffee, work or chocolate, or know others who we might describe as being 'hooked'\n\non television or using pornography. But do these assumptions have any basis in fact?The issue all comes down to how addiction is defined in the first place \u2013 as many of us in the field disagree on what the core components of addiction actually are. Many would argue that the words \"addiction\" and \"addictive\" are used so much in everyday circumstances that they have become meaningless.For instance, saying that a book is an \"addictive read\" or that a specific television series is \"addictive viewing\" renders the word useless in a clinical setting. Here, the word \"addictive\" is arguably used in a positive way and as such it devalues its real meaning.\nHealthy enthusiasm \u2026 or real problem?The question I get asked most \u2013 particularly by the broadcast media \u2013 is what is the difference between a healthy excessive enthusiasm and an addiction?My response is simple: a healthy excessive enthusiasm adds to life, whereas an addiction takes away from it.I also believe that to be classed as an addiction, any such behaviour should comprise a number of key components, including overriding preoccupation with the behaviour, conflict with other activities and relationships, withdrawal symptoms when unable to engage in the activity, an increase in the behaviour over time (tolerance), and use of the behaviour to alter mood state.Other consequences, such as feeling out of control with the behaviour and cravings for the behaviour are often present.If all these signs and symptoms are present then I would call the behaviour a true addiction. But that hasn't stopped others accusing me of watering down the concept of addiction.\nThe science of addictionA few years ago, Steve Sussman, Nadra Lisha and I published a review examining the relationship between 11 potentially addictive behaviours reported in the academic literature: smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, taking illicit drugs, eating, gambling, internet use, love, sex, exercise, work and shopping.We examined the data from 83 large-scale studies and reported a prevalence of an addiction among US adults ranged from as low as 15 percent to as high as 61 percent in a 12-month period.We also reported it plausible that 47 percent of the US adult population suffers from maladaptive signs of an addictive disorder over a 12-month period and that it may be useful to think of addictions as due to problems of lifestyle as well as to person-level factors.In short \u2013 and with many caveats \u2013 our paper argued that at any one time almost half the US population is addicted to one or more behaviours.\nThere is a lot of scientific literature showing that having one addiction increases the propensity to have other addictions.For instance, in my own research, I have come across alcoholic pathological gamblers \u2013 and we can all probably think of people we might describe as caffeine-addicted workaholics.It is also common for people who give up one addiction to replace it with another (which we psychologists call \"reciprocity\").This is easily understandable as when a person gives up one addiction it leaves a void in the person's life and often the only activities that can fill the void and give similar experiences are other potentially addictive behaviours.This has led many people to describe such people as having an \"addictive personality\".Addictive personalities?While there are many pre-disposing factors for addictive behaviour, including genes and personality traits, such as high neuroticism (anxious, unhappy, prone to negative emotions) and low conscientiousness (impulsive, careless, disorganised), addictive personality is a myt",
        "b": "Title: Understanding the Complexities of Behavioral Addictions: A Closer Look at the Science Behind Repetitive Routines\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have delved into the intricate world of behavioral addictions, shedding light on the similarities and differences between these compulsive behaviors and substance abuse disorders. The study, titled \"Addiction and Compulsion: Overlapping Mechanisms in Behavioral Addictions,\" explores the commonalities across various dependence syndromes, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving these repetitive routines.\n\nThe term 'addiction' typically refers to repetitive behaviors aimed at obtaining chemicals, such as drugs or alcohol. However, the study highlights that behavioral addictions also play a significant role in this realm. These behavioral addictions encompass a range of compulsive behaviors, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), compulsive spending (including gambling), overeating (bulimia), hypersexuality (both straight and deviant), and kleptomania.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study is the presence of a repeated urge to engage in behaviors that are known to be counterproductive. This urge is often accompanied by mounting tension, which is temporarily alleviated upon completing the behavior. However, the urge gradually returns, leading to a cycle of repetitive behaviors. The study also emphasizes the role of external and internal cues in triggering these urges, as well as the importance of secondary conditioning in reinforcing these behaviors.\n\nThe researchers note that the urge to complete a behavior and the discomfort experienced when prevented from doing so bear striking similarities to the craving and withdrawal symptoms observed in substance abusers. While some withdrawal symptoms are common across different addictive syndromes, others may be more specific to certain behaviors. The study also highlights the overlap between addiction (pull) and compulsion (push), suggesting that these phenomena can occur sequentially or concurrently.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores the varying levels of pleasure associated with different addictions at various stages. Prolonged exposure to these behaviors may lead to a reduction in the urge and discomfort, particularly in OCD, and potentially in other addictive syndromes as well. The researchers emphasize the importance of conditioned cues in these behaviors and suggest that therapists need to understand the specific details of these cues for each syndrome to achieve lasting efficacy.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the complexities of behavioral addictions and their underlying mechanisms. By highlighting the similarities between behavioral and chemical addictions, the research opens up new avenues for the early management and prevention of relapse in individuals struggling with these compulsive behaviors. The findings pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of addiction and compulsion, offering hope for improved treatment strategies in the future.",

        "a": "Title: Unprecedented Rifts and Ice M\u00e9lange Disintegration Trigger Major Calving Event at Pine Island Glacier\n\nIn a recent study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have documented a significant calving event at the Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica that was triggered by the development of multiple rifts originating from basal crevasses in the center of the ice shelf. This event marks a departure from the typical calving process observed in polar ice shelves and is believed to be linked to ocean-ice dynamic forcing.\n\nThe Pine Island Glacier has experienced several major iceberg calving events in the past, usually associated with rifts at the heavily fractured shear margin propagating across the width of the ice shelf. However, the recent calving event was unique in that the rifts initiated from basal crevasses in the center of the ice shelf, resulting in calving further upglacier than previously observed.\n\nThe researchers also noted the sudden disintegration of the ice m\u00e9lange that filled the northern shear margin, leading to the detachment of the ice sheet from this margin. This phenomenon coincided with the formation of the rifts and is believed to have been a key factor in the calving event.\n\nAnalysis of ice velocity data indicated that the internal rifting was likely a result of a change in the ice shelf stress regime caused by the disintegration of the ice m\u00e9lange and intensified melting within the basal crevasses. These changes are thought to be linked to ocean forcing, highlighting the complex interplay between ocean dynamics and ice shelf stability.\n\nThe findings from this study shed light on the mechanisms driving calving events at the Pine Island Glacier and underscore the importance of understanding the role of ocean-ice interactions in shaping the dynamics of polar ice shelves. As climate change continues to impact the Antarctic region, further research will be crucial in predicting and mitigating the potential consequences of ice shelf instability on global sea level rise.",
        "b": "Last year, a massive 583-square-kilometre (225-square-mile) chunk of the Pine Island Glacier - a vast section of ice that holds the West Antarctic ice sheet together - broke free, heading out into the ocean to eventually melt and raise sea levels across the world.\nNow, new evidence from satellite imagery suggests that this break was caused by a rupture in the shelf 32 kilometres (20 miles) inland, indicating that the glacier is actually breaking apart from the inside, and not the periphery, as scientists had long suspected. And even worse - a second inland rift is now reportedly forming.You can see another of these inland rifts in the image at the top of the page. This new rift has formed in the centre of the Pine Island Glacier over the past few months, indicating a worrying trend.Researchers are now faced with predicting how massive shedding events like this will affect global\n\nsea levels in the future, which is crucial, when you consider that roughly half of the world's population lives near a coastline.\"It's generally accepted that it's no longer a question of whether the West Antarctic ice sheet will melt, it's a question of when,\"\n\nsays researcher Ian Howat\n\nfrom Ohio State University.\n\"This kind of rifting behaviour provides another mechanism for rapid retreat of these glaciers, adding to the probability that we may see significant collapse of West Antarctica in our lifetimes.\"So how does an ice shelf form a rift so far inland?Well, it's quite simple: warm ocean water seeps into a crevasse inside the ice shelf, heating it up from underneath. Over time, this warm water cuts away more and more ice, working its way up into the hidden crevasse until it cuts a huge chunk of the sheet free.\"Rifts usually form at the margins of an ice shelf, where the ice is thin and subject to shearing that rips it apart.\n\nHowever, this latest event in the Pine Island Glacier was due to a rift that originated from the centre of the ice shelf and propagated out to the margins,\" Howat explains.\n\"This implies that something weakened the centre of the ice shelf, with the most likely explanation being a crevasse melted out at the bedrock level by a warming ocean.\"This hypothesis is backed up by the fact that Howat's team found that the rift opened up inside one of the sheet's valleys.These valleys, which are dips where parts of the ice sheet lie lower than sea level, allow warm water to reach further inland underneath it, causing indentations to form on the surface as ice melts below.\"The really troubling thing is that there are many of these valleys further up-glacier,\" Howat said. \"If they are actually sites of weakness that are prone to rifting, we could potentially see more accelerated ice loss in Antarctica.\"The team was able to come to their conclusions thanks to data collected by the Landsat 8 satellite\n\n-\n\na joint project between NASA and the US Geological Survey, launched in 2013 to monitor changes on Earth's surface.\nUsing this data, they were able to look for signs of the break that happened in 2015 - before the event occurred - coming across the rift formation in the process.The team's discovery is crucial to our understanding of how the world's ice sheets are melting as our planet gets warmer and warmer.According to the team, about half of the world's fresh water is locked in Antarctica and the Pine Island Glacier.Along with its 'twin' - the Thwaites Glacier - these two glaciers are vital to keeping all this water trapped, because they block ice streams from the outer ocean.This means that if both - or really, just one - gives way, a bunch of that trapped ice will drift out into warmer ocean waters where it will melt.You can picture this by imagining a cup of water with a big ice cube on top of it - big enough to touch the water inside but too large to actually fit inside the glass's rim.\nIf this ice should melt, the water it releases will enter the glass, causing the water level to rise. This process happens a whole lot faster if the ice is broken up before it drops down, helping it to melt even quicker.In real life, if that Antarctic 'ice cube' melts into our oceans, sea levels would rise an expected 3 metres (10 feet) across the globe, endangering many coastal cities like New York and Miami.\"We need to understand exactly how these valleys and rifts form, and what they mean for\n\nice shelf\n\nstability,\" Howat explains.\n\n\"We're limited in what information we can get from space, so this will mean targeting air and field campaigns to collect more detailed observations.\"If the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet really is an inevitability, we'll just have to hope that we can manage the consequences for life on Earth.\n\nThe team's work was published in Geophysical Research Letters",

But hopefully, once you've read this, you'll be in a better position than you were before to get rid of it, or any other imaginary music playing on repeat in your mind's ear.\nResearch suggests that 'earworms' \u2013 that experience of having music stuck in your head \u2013 are commonplace. It also suggests, contrary to popular belief, that most of the time earworms are not particularly troublesome. But I'm not alone in sometimes seeking to silence those silent songs. So here are six tips for earworm eradication based on the latest research.1. Shut your earsFirst of all, avoid music. This is certainly easier said than done \u2013 and, as a musician, not something I would seriously recommend. That being said, I'm careful to avoid hearing any music before going to bed, since its transformation into an earworm interferes with my sleep. Repetition and recency are the dreaded 'Rs'of earworm sufferers.Try not to listen to a song over and over again, and avoid music that is in itself highly repetitive. We also know that having heard a song recently is the most cited reason for then imagining it. If you'd rather that a different song played from your mental jukebox, make sure that this is the last thing that you hear.\nThere is also some evidence that if the music we are listening to is interrupted, we continue it mentally (known as the Zeigarnik effect). To prevent this from happening, it's advisable to listen through to the end of the track.2. Physical remediesBut should these earworm prevention tips have failed, how can we get rid of intrusive musical thoughts?A recent research paper claims that chewing gum provides a simple solution. In a series of experiments, participants who were given gum to chew reported fewer earworms than those who weren't. Normally, our vocal apparatus is involved in singing, so the theory goes that when our jaws are otherwise engaged, our ability to imagine music is impaired.Another tip to foil your earworm is to walk at a much faster or slower pace than the song's beat. It seems that we form relatively accurate memories for the tempo of familiar music",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Insights into the Phenomenon of 'Earworms' - Catchy Tunes That Repeat Unwanted\n\nIn a recent study published in the Journal of Psychology, researchers have delved into the intriguing phenomenon of 'earworms' - those pesky catchy tunes that repeat in our minds involuntarily. The study sheds light on the prevalence of earworms, their impact on individuals, and the strategies used to cope with them.\n\nThe research, comprising two separate studies, utilized survey data and diary entries to explore the experience of earworms among participants. The findings revealed that while earworms are a common occurrence, they are not typically perceived as problematic by most individuals. However, those who place a high importance on music in their lives reported experiencing earworms that were longer in duration and more challenging to control compared to those who view music as less significant.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from the study was the variability in the tunes that trigger earworms among individuals. Despite this diversity, the tunes causing earworms were always familiar to the individuals experiencing them. Additionally, the research highlighted that while earworm recurrence is relatively rare and typically does not persist for more than 24 hours, the length of both the earworm and the overall experience often surpass conventional estimates of auditory memory capacity.\n\nInterestingly, the study also found that active attempts to block or eliminate earworms were less effective than passive acceptance, aligning with Wegner's theory of ironic mental control. This suggests that trying too hard to rid oneself of an earworm may actually make it more persistent.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the nature of earworms and how individuals perceive and cope with these involuntary musical intrusions. By understanding the factors that influence the occurrence and persistence of earworms, researchers hope to develop more effective strategies for managing this common yet intriguing phenomenon.",

Dubbed Livia, this new medical device claims to be an \"off switch for menstrual pain\".Okay, so first thing's first: how does this supposed 'miracle cure' actually work?\n\nAs the Livia website explains, the device comes with two electrodes, which you need to place on the painful areas on your abdomen. Switch the device on, and these electrodes will start delivering imperceptible electric pulses to your nerves, which will settle the pain.\nIf it sounds too good to be true, I'm right there with you. But this thing has been getting some serious hype, according to Julia Belluz at Vox:\n\"Livia has received rave reviews in international women's magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, and more than 3,000 crowdfunders from around the world have put upward of $284,000 into Livia's Indiegogo campaign.\"\nWhile founder and CEO of Livia, Chen Nachum, insists that they've so far tested the device on 163 women in two different trials, with more than 80 percent of them reporting pain-relieving effects, we're yet to see the results for ourselves in a peer-reviewed study, so there's still a whole lot we don't know about this particular device.But what we do know is that the technology Livia is based on isn't new, and doctors have been prescribing it for years.\nKnown as TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), electronic nerve stimulators have been used to treat all kinds of pain in the past, from neck and back aches to labour pain. It basically works by 'confusing' your body's nervous system, so it can't figure out what to do with the pain signals it's supposed to be delivering to your brain.\"The idea is the nerve system cannot work with two types of signals at the same time,\" Nachum explained to Belluz, \"so what Livia does is transmit frequency to the nerve system that it is very similar to the body's frequency, but it's not something the body knows.\"Because the signals from the device reach the brain faster than the pain signals from the nerves, the brain doesn't have time to register your menstrual cramps, says Nachum.What Nachum is describing might sound really simple (and makes our nervous system seem kinda gullible), it's actually rooted in a whole lot of science, Belluz reports:\n\"Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN and pain medicine specialist, noted that the idea of using TENS for menstrual pain is actually very sound. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Its conclusion: 'High-frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.'\"\nGunter told Vox she's been prescribing high-frequency TENS for period pain for more than 15 years, and while the technique doesn't necessary work for everyone, it really helps some women. \"Prescribed one this morning, in fact,\" she said.\nRight now, you're able to preorder a Livia device for US$85 and wait six months for it to ship, and Nacham says they're in the middle of another study, this time with 60 participants, to get a better idea of how effective it is.\n\nAnd while we certainly don't recommend that you invest in one until we see the actual study results, it'll be interesting to see if Livia's application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a menstrual pain reliever will be approved.Gunter told Vox that her main concern with the device is that it might not provide frequencies that are high enough to be effective, and Nacham has refused to comment on the device's exact frequency, perhaps for competition reasons.\n\nIf you're really curious, head to your GP now and get them to fill you in on TENS. Even if it turns out that Livia doesn't actually live up to the hype, you've got a whole lot of science on your side if you want to try the generic version",
        "b": "Title: High-Frequency TENS Effective for Treating Menstrual Cramps: Study Finds\n\nA recent study has shed light on the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in alleviating primary dysmenorrhoea, commonly known as painful menstrual cramps. The research, published in a leading scientific journal, compared high and low-frequency TENS to placebo, no treatment, or medical therapy for dysmenorrhoea.\n\nDysmenorrhoea affects a significant number of women worldwide, leading to discomfort and reduced quality of life during menstruation. Traditional medical treatments for dysmenorrhoea, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral contraceptives, aim to reduce uterine muscle activity. In contrast, TENS is a non-pharmacological intervention that has been shown to effectively relieve pain in various conditions by potentially altering the body's pain reception and perception mechanisms.\n\nThe study, which included seven randomized controlled trials, found that high-frequency TENS was more effective in providing pain relief compared to placebo TENS. The odds ratio for pain relief with high-frequency TENS was 7.2, with a 95% confidence interval of 3.1 to 16.5. On the other hand, low-frequency TENS did not show a significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo TENS, with an odds ratio of 1.48 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.43 to 5.08.\n\nWhile high-frequency TENS demonstrated efficacy in treating dysmenorrhoea in several small trials, the study highlighted the need for further investigation into potential minor adverse effects associated with the treatment. Additionally, the effectiveness of low-frequency TENS in reducing menstrual cramps remains inconclusive due to insufficient evidence.\n\nThe findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential use of TENS as a non-pharmacological approach to managing primary dysmenorrhoea. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to explore the optimal frequency and parameters of TENS for effectively alleviating menstrual cramps and improving the quality of life for individuals experiencing dysmenorrhoea.",

In other words, before we start blaming whole countries for the state of the planet, we should probably be looking at our own habits and demands.\"If you look at China's per capita consumption-based (environmental) footprint, it is small,\" said researcher Diana Ivanova from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. \"They produce a lot of products but they export them. It's different if you put the responsibility for those impacts on the consumer, as opposed to the producer.\"In their analysis, published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, the researchers examined the environmental impact of consumers across 43 countries and 5 rest-of-the-world regions.\nBy measuring 'secondary impacts' \u2013 the environmental effects of producing the goods and products we buy every day \u2013 the researchers say consumers are responsible for more than 60 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 80 percent of global water use.Norwegian University of Science and Technology\"We all like to put the blame on someone else, the government, or businesses,\" said Ivanova. \"But between 60\u201380 per cent of the impacts on the planet come from household consumption. If we change our consumption habits, this would have a drastic effect on our environmental footprint as well.\"When you look at the impacts of consumers based on where they live, the researchers found a pattern: the richer a country is, the more its inhabitants consume, and the greater each person's impact on the planet.

The study also points out that wealthier countries tend to generate the most significant environmental impacts per capita, indicating an uneven distribution of footprints across regions.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study is the strong relationship between households' expenditure and their environmental impacts, driven by the increasing demand for non-primary consumption items. The study identifies mobility, shelter, and food as the most important consumption categories contributing to environmental footprints.\n\nFood consumption, in particular, has a substantial impact on land and water resources globally, with meat, dairy, and processed food consumption increasing rapidly with income levels. Shelter and mobility are highlighted for their high carbon and material intensity, while services also play a significant role in environmental footprints due to the large amount of household expenditure associated with them.\n\nThe study underscores the need for sustainable consumption patterns and policies to mitigate the environmental impact of household consumption. By understanding the environmental footprints of different consumption categories, policymakers and individuals can make informed decisions to reduce their ecological footprint and contribute to global sustainability efforts.\n\nOverall, the study sheds light on the significant role households play in driving environmental pressures and emphasizes the importance of addressing consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable future for the planet.",

Vivianite, known for its color-changing properties from white or grayish to blue upon exposure to air, requires specific conditions for its formation, including sources of iron phosphate, water, low levels of oxygen, and sulfide, with microbial activity also playing a role.\n\nThe presence of vivianite in 25 exhumed burials at the North Brisbane Burial Ground has shed light on the site's history and preservation. The mineral's formation has implications for artifact conservation, as bone or tissue samples for DNA analysis are recommended to be taken from areas distant from vivianite encrustations. Vivianite has been found to protect skeletal and dental elements, preserve impressions of metal coffin lacing, and corroborate oral histories of temporary waterlogging at the site.\n\nThe discovery of vivianite at the North Brisbane Burial Ground not only provides a more detailed interpretation of the site's conditions but also acts as a measure of pollution levels across the area. This finding highlights the importance of considering vivianite in archaeological studies, as its presence can offer valuable clues about past environments and human activities.\n\nDespite the lack of discussion on vivianite in most archaeological texts, this study underscores the significance of this mineral in unraveling the mysteries of ancient sites.

During those days, coffins often had a window for grieving family members to peer inside even if the lid was closed during the funeral.Sometime after he was buried, that window broke, allowing groundwater to come inside the iron coffin and interact with his body.\nOver a century later, White was exhumed because of land developments in the area. To the shock of everyone around, they found his body completely blue with large blue vivianite crystals forming all over him and inside the coffin. Here's what vivianite looks like on a piece of bone that was buried in sand:Terry O'Connor/BoneCommonsVivianite has also been found on the remains of American soldiers who died in a plane crash in Vietnam.

The study, published in a leading scientific journal, sheds new light on the formation and evolution of gullies on the Red Planet.\n\nThe researchers found that most Martian gullies appear spectrally indistinct from their surroundings due to dust mantling. However, when spectral information on gully sediments was obtained, a diverse range of mineralogies were identified. These mineralogies were found to be related to the source rock, suggesting that gully-forming processes involved the transportation of underlying material downslope.\n\nInterestingly, the study did not find evidence to support the idea that specific compositions are more likely to be associated with gullies or the formation of hydrated minerals as a result of recent liquid water activity. Instead, the researchers observed seasonal carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) frosts in gullies at middle to high latitudes. This finding suggests that seasonal frost-driven processes may play a crucial role in the evolution of Martian gullies.\n\nOne of the most significant conclusions of the study is that there is no clear indication of a role for long-lived liquid water in the formation and evolution of Martian gullies. This challenges previous hypotheses that liquid water may have played a key role in shaping the Martian landscape.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the geological processes that have shaped the Martian surface.

Scientists have found strong evidence - in the form of hydrated salt - that those are\n\ncaused by flowing water.\n\nGullies, on the other hand, occur between 30 and 50 degrees latitude in both the northern and southern hemispheres, and are more of a deep 'channel-like' structure.They\n\nwere first discovered back in 2000,\n\ngetting everyone excited about the presence of liquid water on Mars, because they looked a lot like gullies here on Earth - which we know are formed by liquid.But, back in 2014, NASA found evidence that these gullies were more likely formed by the seasonal freezing of carbon dioxide, not liquid water after all, and it was unlikely that there would be enough water on the surface of the Red Planet to carve something like them out.\nStill, scientists have remained divided on the issue, and seeing as no rovers have gotten close enough to analyse the minerals present at the sites, we haven't had any definitive evidence either way.But new data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) adds further\n\nweight\n\nto the hypothesis that these channels weren't carved out by water, as much as we\n\nall love the idea of rivers flowing across the Red Planet.To figure this out, researchers from Johns Hopkins University examined high-resolution data on more than 100 gully sites across Mars.\n\nThat data came from the MRO's on-board spectrometer, known as CRISM, which is able to perform chemical analyses by measuring the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation being emitted by a sample.They were looking for any trace of water or its by-products near the gully, but failed to find any - making it very unlikely that water played a role in making them.\n\"The findings showed no mineralogical evidence for abundant liquid water or its by-products, thus pointing to mechanisms other than the flow of water - such as the freeze and thaw of carbon dioxide frost - as being the major drivers of recent gully evolution,\" the team explains in a press release.But that doesn't mean water was never involved, simply that it hasn't been involved in recent history.\"On Earth and on Mars, we know that the presence of phyllosilicates - clays - or other hydrated minerals indicates formation in liquid water,\" said study leader Jorge N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\"In our study, we found no evidence for clays or other hydrated minerals in most of the gullies we studied, and when we did see them, they were erosional debris from ancient rocks, exposed and transported downslope, rather than altered in more recent flowing water.\"\n\"These gullies are carving into the terrain and exposing clays that likely formed billions of years ago when liquid water was more stable on the Martian surface,\" he added.So, we still can't say for sure what formed these gullies, but we've now ruled out one hypothesis. And hopefully as we get more data we'll have a better idea of the\n\ncurrent geological processes shaping the surface of Mars\u2026 especially seeing as we hope to live there one day.The research has been published in Geophysical Research Letters",

The study, conducted using fast pore-scale X-ray imaging, sheds light on a new type of steady-state flow behavior termed \"dynamic connectivity.\"\n\nTraditionally, the understanding of steady-state multiphase Darcy flow in porous media has been based on the concept that fluid phases organize into separate flow pathways with stable interfaces. However, the recent findings challenge this conventional wisdom by revealing a dynamic and ever-changing network of connections through which the nonwetting phase flows.\n\nThe research team observed the flow of nitrogen (N2) and brine through a permeable sandstone under subsurface reservoir conditions and low capillary numbers. Despite maintaining constant fluid saturation, the researchers found that the network of pores filled with the nonwetting phase was not always connected. Instead, the flow occurred along pathways that periodically reconnected, akin to cars navigating through traffic lights.\n\nThis behavior, as explained by the researchers, is consistent with an energy balance where some of the energy of the injected fluids is sporadically converted to create new interfaces. The implications of this discovery are significant, as it challenges existing models of two-phase flow that are fundamental to understanding subsurface flow processes such as geologic CO2 storage and hydrocarbon recovery.\n\nThe findings of this study have far-reaching implications for various industries, including oil and gas exploration, groundwater management, and environmental remediation. By uncovering the phenomenon of dynamic connectivity in multiphase flow through porous media, researchers have opened up new avenues for refining existing models and enhancing our understanding of complex fluid dynamics in natural systems.\n\nAs scientists continue to delve deeper into the intricacies of fluid flow through porous media, the discovery of dynamic connectivity marks a pivotal moment in advancing our knowledge of how immiscible fluids interact and move through geological formations. This study not only expands our understanding of fundamental processes but also paves the way for more accurate predictions and improved management of subsurface resources in the future.",
        "b": "Scans taken of fluids moving through rock have shown engineers have had it wrong when it comes to substances flowing through porous materials.For the past century, the movement of gases and liquids through rocks has been modelled using a law that assumes they flow in a stable pattern. Under the microscope, it turns out this was the wrong assumption to make.\nThe discovery made by researchers from Imperial College London might not seem all that ground-breaking, but any future technology that aims to capture carbon dioxide and store it in underground reservoirs would need their models on how gases move to be as accurate as possible.By scanning a block of sandstone with X-rays produced by a synchrotron called the Diamond Light Source, the engineers created high-speed videos of nitrogen gas and liquid salt-water seeping through microscopic channels, giving them the most detailed moving images of the process to date.Previously X-ray scans took single captures over a number of hours. Using the synchrotron's bursts allowed them to snap the same images in as little as 45 seconds to create a more accurate animation.Until now it was thought that the two different phases of fluid would stick to their own channel, flowing in a static, if still complex manner.\nThis was all thanks to a 19th century French engineer named Henry Darcy, who came up with a hydraulics law to describe how fluids moved through porous materials.His law was later extended to mathematically describe the relative permeability of a porous material, one that depended on the phase of fluid pushing through it.Darcy's extended law didn't take into account interactions between different fluids moving through their own channels, which although an assumption, has been a useful way to describe most hydraulic phenomena.The images produced by the Imperial College researchers shows that far from being stable, the pathways taken by the two fluids stutter and shift, lasting no more than tens of seconds before taking a new direction.Take a look at the short clip below to get a better idea of their findings.\nwidth=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">The researchers liken it to a tiny road-network with traffic lights.\"The flow of cars through the network can be stopped by a red traffic light, blocking a junction for a short time. When the light turns green \u2013 when the local energy balance\n\nfavours movement again \u2013 the flow continues down the same road,\" the researchers write.Since the sudden shifts in 'traffic' take just a split moment, the researchers hope to eventually capture images on the scale of 100ths of a second, something currently impossible with existing X-ray technology.They have called this process dynamic connectivity, and it could have significant applications in a variety of contexts.\n\"Trying to model how fluids flow through rock at large scales has proven to be a major scientific and engineering challenge,\" says lead researcher Catriona Reynolds.\"Engineers have long suspected that there were some major gaps in our understanding of the underlying physics of fluid flow. Our new observations in this study will force engineers to re-evaluate their modelling techniques, increasing their accuracy.\"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one engineering feat that requires sound understanding of how gases and liquids move through a porous substance.In simple terms, the practice would see emissions from industrial fossil fuel combustion pumped into stable subterranean reservoirs, such as deleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers.There are various proposed solutions, including dissolving CO2 in water and pumping it into basalt where it could mineralise, trapping the carbon as a solid.\nSuch diverse technologies would all have their pros and cons, and pose clear risks and benefits. But most would benefit from knowing what's happening to the fluids at a microscopic level.The modifications to the existing models could also have applications in understanding how freshwater moves into aquifers deep underground, or how seawater flows through the bedrock, providing a more accurate insight into the crust's volatility.Controversially, it might also help improve processes that extract fossil fuels from underground, providing safer, more efficient fracking processes.No doubt Mr Darcy would be quite pleased to find it was time his old law was given a good tweak.This research was published in PNA",

The study, published in a reputable journal, reviewed and summarized recent epidemiological and biological research on alcohol and cancer, drawing upon published meta-analyses and additional studies not included in these publications.\n\nThe findings of the study suggest that there is strong evidence supporting the assertion that alcohol consumption is a cause of cancer at multiple sites in the body, including the oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colon, rectum, and breast. The research indicates that the associations between alcohol consumption and these types of cancer exhibit gradients of effect that are biologically plausible.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlights that there is some evidence of reversibility of risk in certain types of cancer, such as laryngeal, pharyngeal, and liver cancers, when alcohol consumption ceases. While the true effects of alcohol consumption on cancer risk may vary slightly from current estimates due to limitations in cohort studies, the overall conclusion remains consistent: alcohol consumption is a significant risk factor for cancer development.\n\nThe study also raises concerns about the conflicting messages in the media regarding the potential protective association of alcohol with cardiovascular disease. The researchers suggest that a high level of skepticism is now warranted regarding these findings, given the strong evidence linking alcohol consumption to an increased risk of cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, the study emphasizes that confirmation of specific biological mechanisms by which alcohol increases the incidence of each type of cancer is not necessary to infer that alcohol is a cause. The researchers estimate that alcohol-attributable cancers at the identified sites make up 5.8% of all cancer deaths worldwide, underscoring the importance of understanding and communicating the risks associated with alcohol consumption.\n\nThis research provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer, highlighting the need for public health initiatives to raise awareness about the risks and promote responsible drinking habits to reduce the burden of alcohol-related cancers globally.",
        "b": "A leading medical researcher has looked over the research and concluded that drinking alcohol \u2013 even in small amounts \u2013 doesn't just cause liver cancer, but can also lead to six other types of cancer.\nAccording to Jennie Connor, from the University of Otago in New Zealand, the evidence suggests that booze causes cancer of the mouth and throat, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, bowel, and breast.The research still isn't clear about how or why alcohol causes the mutations needed for cancer to form, but Connor says the findings indicate more than a casual association.\"There is strong evidence that alcohol causes cancer at seven sites in the body and probably others,\" said Connor.\"Even without complete knowledge of biological mechanisms, the epidemiological evidence can support the judgment that alcohol causes cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and breast.\"To come to this conclusion, Connor analysed many of the major alcohol-based cancer studies from the last decade to pull all of the data together and examine the links between them.\nIn the end, she concluded that alcohol has a dose-response relationship to cancer formation, meaning that the more a person drinks, the more likely they will be to develop certain cancers.\"The highest risks are associated with the heaviest drinking, but a considerable burden is experienced by drinkers with low to moderate consumption, due to the distribution of drinking in the population,\" Connor told\n\nDenis Campbell from The Guardian.The strongest of these links was between drinking and mouth cancer. According to Connor, drinking 50 grams of alcohol per day can increase a person's risks of mouth cancer up to seven times that of a non-drinker.To put that into perspective because 'grams of alcohol' isn't really the best unit to understand, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism says that an average drink \u2013 something like a run-of-the-mill beer or a normal wine \u2013 has roughly 14 grams of alcohol in them.\nWhich means to get to that risk factor, a person would have to drink four drinks per day, though Connor says that even drinking less still raises the risk.According to health officials in the UK, no level of regular alcohol consumption is safe.In fact, back in January \u2013 long before the current study was published, the UK changed their drinking recommendations for men from 21 units (grams) per week to 14 units, making them the same level as their previous recommendation for women.They also publicly stated that women who drink five units per day are 40 percent more likely to develop breast cancer than non-drinkers, reports The Telegraph.To be clear, this research isn't in itself new, and it's only the conclusion of one scientists. But other researchers are also in agreeance with Connor, too.\nFor example, Susannah Brown, the science program manager for the World Cancer Fund, told New Scientist:\n\"We see the risk increasing as the amount of alcohol consumed increases, and we agree that there is solid evidence to conclude that alcohol consumption directly causes cancer.\"\n\"For cancer prevention, we have long recommended that people should not drink alcohol at all, but we understand that this can be easier said than done.\"\nDespite these results, no one truly understands why the link between cancer and alcohol exists.One of the popular hypotheses is that alcohol might damage DNA, leading to mutations that cause cancer cells to form, but until further research is done, no one really knows.While these new findings will certainly put a downer on our next happy hour foray, it's important to note that without knowing the true cause as to why alcohol causes cancer \u2013 and seeing it happen firsthand \u2013 it's really hard to come up with proper recommendations.\nFor example, coffee was long thought to be carcinogenic, but a recent review by researchers at the World Health Organisation (WHO) found that the real cause of cancer was extremely hot beverages that burn a drinker's throat, leading to mutations in cell growth.Though coffee and alcohol are completely different beverages on many levels, the June study shows how new knowledge can really sway findings.Until that happens we have to accept that one of the oldest beverages in existence \u2013 one that might have even sparked the agricultural revolution \u2013 might be negatively impacting our health in very serious ways.The commentary was recently published in the journal Addiction.Update 26 July 2016:\n\nIn an earlier version of the story we incorrectly stated that Connor's article was a meta-analysis, which is incorrect - it's just personal commentary.

        "a": "The relationship between mind, brain, and body has kept philosophers and scientists busy for centuries. Some of the first interesting \u2013 albeit gruesome \u2013 experiments on the role of the body in human consciousness considered life after decapitation. In 1905, French physician Gabriel Beaurieux believed he had communicated with prisoner Henri Languille after his head had been severed from his body.\nWriting of the experience, Beaurieux said:\n\"I called in a strong, sharp voice: 'Languille!' I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions \u2013 I insist advisedly on this peculiarity \u2013 but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts.\"\nAlmost two decades later, Soviet scientist Sergei Brukhonenko reportedly kept a dog's severed head alive for nearly six months using a primitive heart-lung machine.Video footage allegedly shows the head responding to light, sound and citric acid stimuli.But while Brukhonenko's research may have been an important in the development of cardiac surgery \u2013 it is more often regarded as faked Soviet-era propaganda. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">Consciousness and non-physical properties\nInvestigations into human consciousness have moved on since these initial observations \u2013 though we haven't got away from decapitation just yet. More recently, however, neuroscientists have questioned just how it is that physical matter comes together to make the mind.In 1995, Francis Crick wrote in\n\nThe Astonishing Hypothesis that we are nothing more than an \"immensely complex collection of neurons\".This hypothesis is a form of reductive physicalism \u2013 a philosophical position to which modern neuroscience typically subscribes \u2013 that everything in existence is no more than its physical properties.Again using animal decapitation, though this time with rats, neuroscientists have explored the question of how long brain activity is observed after death \u2013 a step forward from just consciousness.\nIn a 2011 experiment, it was reported that decapitated rats' time to unconsciousness \u2013 defined by a decrease in cognitive activity of 50 percent \u2013 was 4 seconds.The researchers also observed a very large and much later slow wave in brain activity. This was interpreted as what they called a \"wave of death\" \u2013 when all the brain's neurons died at the same time \u2013 and perhaps, the ultimate border between life and death.But some believe that the mind is more than just the sum of its physical brain cells. A contrasting position to physicalism is the dualist assumption that the physical and the mental are fundamentally different substances.Furthermore, some philosophers and scientists have suggested that \"information may be the key to consciousness\".Consistent with this idea is integrated information theory, which accepts the existence of consciousness, but controversially implies that anything at all may be conscious \u2013 even a smartphone \u2013 if it possesses a sufficiently high \"phi\": a measure of information in a system which cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts.\nFrom psychological moments to mortalityWhile I have left out many important details in this fascinating discussion, better understanding the link between mind, brain and body has been the focus of my own research, in recent years through looking at the functions of the vagus nerve.Higher vagus nerve function (measured and indexed by heart rate variability) supports a person's capacity for emotion regulation, social engagement and cognitive function.By contrast, impaired vagal function \u2013 and lower heart rate variability \u2013 may play a role in the onset of depression.But the vagus nerve doesn't just affect the mind. Higher levels of vagal function may lead to improved glucose regulation, reduced inflammation, and reduced risk of disease and death.Vagal function is also known to play an important role in brain cognition. It helps to suppress irrelevant and interfering stimuli",
        "b": "Title: Study Shows Heart Rate Variability Predicts Inflammation Levels, Implications for Cardiovascular Health\n\nA new study has shed light on the relationship between heart rate variability and inflammation, with potential implications for conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The research, published in a scientific journal, highlights the role of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in modulating inflammation levels in the body.\n\nThe study, conducted on healthy employees who participated in a voluntary on-site health assessment, involved obtaining blood samples and ambulatory heart rate recordings to calculate night-time high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV). The data collected from 106 nonsmoking employees over a four-year period revealed intriguing findings.\n\nContrary to previous cross-sectional studies that showed a negative association between HF-HRV and inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), this prospective study demonstrated a different trend. Higher CRP levels at baseline were found to predict higher HF-HRV at follow-up, indicating a complex interplay between heart rate variability and inflammation.\n\nThe researchers found that higher HF-HRV was associated with lower levels of CRP at both time points, with the relationship remaining significant even after adjusting for factors like sex, age, and body mass index. These results provide in vivo support for the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in humans, suggesting that cardiac vagal modulation at baseline can predict inflammation levels four years later.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant, particularly in the context of cardiovascular health. The study suggests that interventions targeted at improving vagally mediated heart rate variability could potentially help in preventing diseases associated with elevated systemic inflammation, ultimately reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.\n\nOverall, this research adds to our understanding of the intricate relationship between heart rate variability and inflammation, paving the way for future studies and interventions aimed at harnessing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway for improved health outcomes.",

There have been reports of two-headed sharks before, but they've all belonged to species that give birth to live animals.\nThe researchers are now trying to learn more about the individual, and the discovery will hopefully provide some insight into exactly what cases the mysterious two-headed mutation - officially known as dicephaly.The shark was a\n\nnear-threatened\n\nAtlantic sawtail catshark\n\n(Galeus atlanticus)\n\nembryo, which had been collected by researchers at the University of Malaga in Spain as part of a study on cardiovascular systems.Out of the 797 embryos they collected, one was different to the rest - it had two heads.\"Each head had a mouth, two eyes, a brain, a notochord [like a spinal cord], and five gill openings on each side,\" the authors write in the\n\nJournal of Fish Biology.The body also had two hearts, two stomachs, and two livers, but it shared just one intestine and a single set of kidneys and reproductive organs.Journal of Fish BiologyThis isn't the first time a two-headed shark has been seen - two-headed bullsharks have been spotted in the past, and there are seven other reports in the scientific literature of sharks with two heads.\nBut all of those species gave birth to live animals, whereas the catshark is the first truly egg-laying shark species to display dicephaly - and that could be the key to figuring out the underlying cause.This particular specimen was euthanised and preserved so the researchers could study it further. In nature, the condition is very rarely encountered, and it's unclear if that's because it's so rare to begin with, or if the creatures simply don't survive long enough to be discovered.There have been reports of\n\ntwo-headed snakes,\n\ncats, and\n\nhumans\n\nin the past.\"Survival after birth may occur, but would likely be very brief,\" Michelle Heupel, a researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, told David Shiffman over at Hakai magazine.\n\n\"It is unclear whether the two heads will preclude swimming and prey capture, and whether joined internal organs will function adequatel",

The unique specimen was found among 797 embryos intended for cardiovascular studies, representing a defect incidence of 0.13%.\n\nThe two-headed shark embryo exhibited remarkable features, with each head possessing a mouth, two eyes, a brain, a notochord, and five gill openings on each side. The two heads were fused behind the gills, forming a single body with four dorsal fins (two anterior and two posterior), two pairs of pectoral fins, a pair of pelvic fins, and one anal fin.\n\nFurther examination revealed two adjacent notochords, two neural tubes, and two dorsal aortas running along the body, which bent 180\u00b0 at its posterior portion. The specimen also had two hearts, two esophaguses, two stomachs, two livers, but a single intestine with a spiral valve.\n\nThis discovery adds to the limited reports of conjoined twins in sharks, which have mainly been observed in oviparous and ovoviviparous species. The seven previously reported dicephalous sharks were similar to the specimen described in this study, featuring two completely separated heads on one body. In contrast, only one case of a diprosopus shark has been documented, with a single body and a single head showing partial duplication of the face.\n\nThe findings challenge previous classifications of abnormal shark specimens, suggesting that some cases described as dicephalous should be reevaluated as diprosopus. Additionally, three cases previously labeled as dicephalous exhibited a combination of diprosopia and dicephalia characteristics.\n\nThis rare discovery sheds new light on the diversity of shark embryonic development and raises intriguing questions about the underlying genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to such anomalies.

The study, conducted by researchers in the field of animal communication, suggests that the terms \"purr\" and \"purring\" should be reserved for vocalizations that are homologous with felid purring.\n\nThe research highlights that the term \"purr\" has been used to describe vocalizations produced by various mammalian species across different orders. While some mammalian vocalizations share structural similarities with felid purring, they have been given different names in the literature. The study argues that using the same term for these vocalizations implies a level of sameness, suggesting they are evolutionarily related and share a common ancestral vocalization type.\n\nThe researchers propose that to maintain clarity and accuracy in the classification of mammalian vocalizations, the terms \"purr\" and \"purring\" should be specifically applied to vocalizations that are homologous with felid purring. Based on current knowledge, the study identifies \"true\" purring as being established only in the families Viverridae and Felidae of the Carnivora order.\n\nFurthermore, the study points out that vocalizations similar in structure to felid purring are observed in other families of the Carnivora order and in several other mammalian orders. However, the researchers suggest that most of these vocalization types likely evolved convergently, meaning they developed independently in different species.\n\nThis research provides valuable insights into the evolution and classification of mammalian vocalizations, emphasizing the importance of accurately identifying and categorizing vocalization types based on their evolutionary relationships. By restricting the use of the term \"purr\" to vocalizations homologous with felid purring, researchers aim to enhance our understanding of the diversity and complexity of mammalian communication systems.",
        "b": "Why do cats purr? Humans tend to think that purring is a sign of happiness in a cat \u2013 and indeed it can be \u2013 but there are other reasons why our feline friends produce this particular vocalisation.\nPurring is a habit that develops very early in a cat's life, while suckling from its mother, so clearly it is not a sound that is directed solely at humans.Cat owners will be well aware that a cat can produce more than one kind of purr, just as they have a whole repertoire of meows, chirps, growls, spits and other sounds.The purr that is produced during suckling, is quite different in quality to the purr that you will hear when your cat is sprawling across your lap being stroked.Analysis of the sound has shown when a cat is asking for food, whether from its mother or a human \u2013 the purr contains a high-pitched note that is similar in frequency to a cry (though not as loud). It may have something of the effect of the cry of a newborn, which affects the hormonal state of female mammals and elicits a care-giving response.\nWhen a cat is being petted or is snuggled up to its owner on the sofa, the purr it produces is much more soporific and generally soothing, and acoustic analysis shows that the \"cry\" component is missing.Adult cats will often purr when they are close to or in physical contact with another cat, engaging in grooming for example. They will also do it when they play with an inanimate object, or while eating, which can be at a time when they are alone.However, the most usual time for purring is in company, and it can be the care soliciting sound, asking to be fed or stroked, or an indication of social pleasure.The darker sideStrangely, vets also report that cats will purr when they are in great pain or just before death. This seems to be illogical if it is a sound relating to pleasure, but in fact, it could be that the cat is asking for help.\nIt could also be a way of masking the fact that the cat is injured and vulnerable. If you are a small animal, even a carnivore, it is not good to show weakness as this could encourage larger predators to come along and eat you.The purr may be the cat equivalent of \"everything's fine, I'm on top of the world. Nothing to see here, move along please\".Can big cats purr too?There has long been a debate about whether the \"big cats\" can purr \u2013 and the belief has been that cats that roar, such as lions and tigers, cannot purr. Although there is no conclusive evidence on this subject, it seems that even cats that roar purr as cubs while suckling.All mammals have a bone or series of bones in the throat called the hyoid apparatus, which supports the larynx and tongue. In cat species that roar the hyoid apparatus is not entirely made of bone but retains some parts as cartilage, while cat species that purr have a hyoid that is completely bon",

Developed by Robert Hare in 1991 and revised in 2004, the PCL-R is a standardized psychological test that has gained widespread recognition for its utility in evaluating individuals with antisocial traits.\n\nThe PCL-R is designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of lifetime psychopathic symptoms, making it particularly valuable in forensic mental health evaluations. It is commonly used in various settings, including sentencing procedures, civil commitment cases, institutional classification decisions, and release determinations. The checklist is administered as part of a broader evaluation to assess the risk and treatability of individuals, aiding in decision-making processes that have significant implications for public safety and individual well-being.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the PCL-R is its adaptability across different cultural and linguistic contexts. The checklist has been translated into numerous foreign languages, allowing for its widespread use in diverse populations. This cross-cultural applicability enhances the tool's effectiveness in assessing psychopathic traits across a range of individuals, regardless of their background or nationality.\n\nThe widespread use of the PCL-R underscores its importance in forensic psychology and highlights its role in informing critical decisions related to the management and treatment of individuals with psychopathic tendencies. By providing a standardized and evidence-based assessment of psychopathic symptoms, the checklist serves as a valuable resource for mental health professionals, legal practitioners, and policymakers involved in the criminal justice system.\n\nAs research continues to advance in the field of forensic psychology, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist\u2013Revised remains a cornerstone tool for evaluating and understanding psychopathic personality disorder symptoms in forensic settings.

The study suggests that atheists are nicer in an attempt to compensate for the stereotype that atheists are immoral.\nResearchers at Ohio University were seeking to study in-group bias and prosocial behaviour, or the tendency groups have to favour their own members.\"We often see that negative stereotypes about a group can lead members of that group to behave in compensatory ways that ostensibly seek to disconfirm that stereotype, such as when American immigrants strive to emphasise their American identity when it is threatened,\" researcher Colleen Cowgill told Psypost.\"This was the rationale behind my hypotheses stating that atheists' behaviour toward Christians in economic games might be different from Christians' behaviour toward atheists in economic games.\"The study was divided into three parts. The first part was conducted using 297 subjects, 150 Christians and 147 atheists. These participants were tasked to play a game based on the Dictator Game, in which one player gives the other player an amount of money.\nIt was designed to test how self-interested people are, with the general prediction that very few people will choose to give their partner money when there are no consequences involved.The researchers modified the game, however, so that participants were led to believe that several rounds of the game would be played, and that the other player would give them a reputation score that other people could see.They were told that the other person knew that they were Christian or atheist. They were then told whether they were paired with a fictional Christian or atheist. Each of them was then told they had the task of dividing up the money they had been given.The second part of the study, involving 233 different participants, 151 Christians and 82 atheists, was almost exactly the same, except for some key differences. The second group didn't know that they weren't partnered with real people, and they had to complete a survey afterwards that evaluated the morality of their partner.\nWhat these parts both found was that Christians gave more money to Christians than they gave to atheists, but that atheists gave the same amount to everyone, regardless of religious status.However, the third part of the study, involving 524 participants, 140 atheists and 384 Christians, showed that this discrepancy isn't purely motivated by altruism. These participants were divided into two groups. The first was told that the other person would not be informed of their religious status. The second was told that they would.When atheists thought that Christians would not know of their atheism, they showed as much in-group bias as Christians did, giving more money to fellow atheists than Christians.\"Our results show that atheists are uniquely concerned about outgroup members seeing them as immoral by virtue of their lack of religiosity, and that these concerns are at least partially responsible for atheists' behaviour toward their Christian partners in economic games,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\nInterplay between the two groups is of ongoing interest to the research team. Researchers Ain Simpson and Kimberly Rios published a study last year that found that they don't understand each other - and that atheists speak more negatively about Christians than the other way round.\"I think it is quite telling that atheists are perhaps so acutely aware of negative stereotypes about themselves that there are observable differences in their behaviour as compared with Christians in even this small, low-stakes type of interaction,\" Cowgill said.\"Research like this in the aggregate begins to build a case that there may be these kinds of hidden costs to the prevalent, unchallenged negative stereotyping in our society.\"The team's paper has been published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psycholog",

In the first part, participants from both groups were asked to assess moral values from their own perspective as well as from the perspective of typical atheists and Christians. The results showed that atheists believed their ingroup endorsed fairness and justice values more than Christians, while Christians believed their ingroup endorsed all moral values more than atheists. Interestingly, both groups held inaccurate stereotypes about the values of the outgroup, often to an extreme degree.\n\nIn the second part of the study, participants were asked to write about the morality of the outgroup. Atheists tended to describe Christians more negatively than Christians described atheists, regardless of the moral foundation being considered. Notably, Christians' negative impressions of atheists were primarily drawn from the Authority foundation, while both groups heavily relied on the Care foundation in both positive and negative depictions.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for addressing the escalating conflict between Christians and atheists in the United States. By understanding and addressing the misconceptions and stereotypes that exist between these groups, it may be possible to foster greater understanding and dialogue, ultimately reducing tensions and promoting harmony in society.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of recognizing and challenging stereotypes and misconceptions, particularly in the context of moral conflicts between different belief systems.

        "a": "Headline: Study Finds Profanity Linked to Honesty, Contradicting Common Beliefs\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a recent study has challenged the commonly held belief that profanity is associated with dishonesty. The study, conducted by researchers from an undisclosed institution, delved into the relationship between profanity and honesty, revealing unexpected results.\n\nThe research, consisting of three separate studies, aimed to explore the connection between profanity and honesty. The first study involved observing profanity behavior and lying in a controlled lab setting with 276 participants. The second study analyzed real-life social interactions on Facebook, involving a staggering 73,789 individuals. Lastly, the third study examined profanity and integrity indexes at the aggregate level of U.S. states, encompassing data from all 50 states.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the findings consistently demonstrated a positive relationship between profanity and honesty. Participants who used profanity were found to engage in less lying and deception at the individual level. Moreover, at the societal level, states with higher rates of profanity usage exhibited higher levels of integrity.\n\nThese results challenge the notion that profanity is solely associated with negative behaviors and suggest that the use of profanity may actually be linked to expressing genuine feelings and intentions. The researchers propose that profanity could serve as a form of authentic communication, leading to increased honesty and integrity in both individual and societal interactions.\n\nThe implications of this study are significant, as they prompt a reevaluation of the stereotypes surrounding profanity and its perceived relationship with dishonesty. Further research in this area may provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between language, behavior, and moral values.",

The peak power produced by the cyclists rose by 24 watts on average when foul language was used.Next, 52 different volunteers were asked to run through an isometric hand test. Again with their choice of curse word, and then their choice of neutral word.When swearing, people's strength was boosted by the equivalent of 2.1 kilograms (4.6 pounds) on average, the researchers said.\"Quite why it is that swearing has these effects on strength and pain tolerance remains to be discovered,\" says Stephens.We can probably rule out the swearing causing a fight-or-flight response, though - heart rates measured during the tests showed no significant changes whether people were swearing or not swearing.\nIt's important to bear in mind that the study used a relatively small sample size, and has yet to be peer-reviewed journal, so these findings are intriguing rather than conclusive for the time being.But the research does tie in with an earlier study carried out by Stephens and his colleagues, which found that throwing out expletives increases a person's pain threshold.The researchers admit that we have yet to fully understand the reactions that swearing kicks off in the body, but more and more, scientists are looking into it.A little boost of strength isn't the only thing swearing has going for it -\n\nanother study published earlier this year found that people who cursed more often were also more likely to be honest, based on tests run on 276 participants.\"Swearing is often inappropriate, but it can also be evidence that someone is telling you their honest opinion,\" explained one of the researchers,\n\nDavid Stillwell from the University of Cambridge in the U",

        "a": "Do you ever have trouble telling right from left? For example you're taking a driving lesson and the instructor asks you to take a left turn and you pause, struggling to think of which way is left.\nIf so, you're not on your own \u2013 a significant proportion of our population has difficulty in telling right from left.Left-right discrimination is a complex neuro-psychological process involving several higher neurological functions such as the ability to integrate sensory and visual information, language function and memory.For some it is second nature but for others a considerable challenge. You can take a test here to see how well you do.One further problem facing the health profession is that when a doctor or nurse faces a patient, their right-side is on the patient's left-side.So correctly distinguishing right from left in a patient also involves the visuo-spatial function of mentally rotating images.Wrong turns to avoidable errorsIt's hardly the end of the world if you take the wrong direction on a journey, but there are many situations where confusing right from left can have devastating consequences.\nSome of the most tragic errors in medicine have been when surgery was performed on the wrong side of a patient: removing the wrong kidney or amputating the wrong leg.While there are systems, checks and balances in place to anticipate and minimise these kinds of mistakes, when they do occur, human error is often at the root of the cause.Error is an inherent characteristic of human behaviour \u2013 sometimes we just get things wrong \u2013 but left-right ones may be more than a one-off accident.Evidence would suggest that right-left confusion is more common in women. The literature would appear to suggest that men demonstrate a greater degree of visuo-spatial function.The 'distraction effect'Distinguishing right from left also never occurs in isolation. Hospitals and other health settings are busy and complex places to work in.\nDoctors are often subject to distractions while working; receiving telephone calls, cardiac monitors bleeping, taking questions from colleagues, patients and their relatives \u2013 the clinical environment can be very challenging.In research we published in Medical Education, we explored the impact of such interruptions on medical students' ability to correctly discriminate right from left.While objectively measuring 234 medical students' ability to distinguish right from left, we subjected them to the typical ambient noise of a ward environment and interrupted them with clinical questions.Our findings were startling. Even the background noise of a ward environment was enough to throw some medical students off when making right-left judgements.Asking them a series of questions while they were trying to distinguish right from left had an even greater impact. The \"distraction effect\" was greater for older and female students",

The study, which involved 322 male and female subjects ranging from children to old adults, aimed to investigate the performance of individuals in determining the right or left hand in line drawings of a person with varying orientations.\n\nThe test required participants to mark with a pencil as quickly as possible whether the figure's hand was on the right or left side, with the line drawings presented from the back, front, or alternating between the two views. The results of the study revealed an interesting pattern in performance across the age groups.\n\nAccording to the findings, there was a noticeable increase in performance from children to young adults, indicating a developmental progression in right-left discrimination ability. However, the study also highlighted a decline in performance among older adults aged over 50 years, suggesting a potential age-related deterioration in this cognitive function.\n\nNotably, the researchers observed that the task became significantly more challenging when the line drawings alternated between front and back views, particularly when both arms of the figure crossed the vertical body midline. This condition posed the greatest difficulty for participants, further emphasizing the complexity of right-left discrimination in varying spatial orientations.\n\nWhile the study did not find significant gender differences in overall performance, it did reveal that male participants in the young adults group (aged 18-22 years) exhibited better performance compared to their female counterparts. The researchers discussed these results in the context of theories related to mental rotation and lateralization of information processing strategies, highlighting the intricate mechanisms involved in right-left discrimination across different age groups.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the age-related changes in right-left discrimination ability and underscores the importance of understanding cognitive processes across the lifespan. Further research in this area could offer valuable implications for cognitive development and potential interventions to support cognitive function in older adults.",

The study, which involved testing TCS on various aquatic organisms including microorganisms, algae, invertebrates, and fish, revealed that TCS was not highly toxic to wastewater microorganisms at concentrations below its aqueous solubility.\n\nThe research, conducted over a series of experiments, found that the 48-hour median effective concentration (EC50) for Daphnia magna was 390 \u03bcg/L, while the 96-hour median lethal concentration values for Pimephales promelas and Lepomis macrochirus were 260 and 370 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Additionally, an early life-stage toxicity test with Onco-rhynchus mykiss determined a no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) of 34.1 \u03bcg/L and a lowest-observed-effect concentration of 71.3 \u03bcg/L.\n\nIn a 96-hour study involving Scenedesmus algae, the biomass EC50 was found to be 1.4 \u03bcg/L, with a NOEC of 0.69 \u03bcg/L. The study also assessed bioconcentration in Danio rerio, revealing an average TCS accumulation factor of 4,157 at 3 \u03bcg/L and 2,532 at 30 \u03bcg/L over a five-week period.\n\nInterestingly, the study highlighted that algae were the most susceptible organisms to TCS toxicity. Furthermore, when evaluating the toxicity of TCS-containing wastewater secondary effluent on P. promelas and Ceriodaphnia, no significant differences in toxicity were observed between control and TCS-treated laboratory units.\n\nThe findings of the study suggest that the neutral form of TCS is associated with toxic effects, but these effects can be mitigated through processes such as ionization and sorption in the aquatic environment. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the environmental impact of TCS on aquatic organisms and underscores the importance of understanding the potential risks associated with antimicrobial compounds in consumer products.",

The repellent, composed of a new class of superhydrophobic nanomaterials, takes its inspiration from a humble but nonetheless remarkable example of natural water repelling: the lotus leaf.\"Nature knows how to make these materials and stay environmentally friendly,\" said chemist Andrew Barron. \"Our job has been to figure out how and why, and to emulate that.\"The researchers' repellent can be applied to a variety of surfaces via spray- or spin-coating and is hydrocarbon-based, making it an economic and green alternative to conventional fluorocarbon-based repellents that are both hazardous and costly to manufacture.According to the researchers, the lotus leaf's remarkable ability to repel water is due to its hierarchy of microscopic and nanoscale double structures.\n\"In the lotus leaf, these are due to papillae within the epidermis and epicuticular waxes on top,\" said Barron. \"In our material, there is a microstructure created by the agglomeration of alumina nanoparticles mimicking the papillae and the hyperbranched organic moieties simulating the effect of the epicuticular waxes.\"To qualify as superhydrophobic, a material needs to demonstrate a water contact angle larger than 150 degrees. A water contact angle is the angle at which the surface of the water meets the surface of the material, quantifying the wettability (yes, it's a word) of a material.The researchers' repellent has an angle of about 155 degrees, making it essentially equivalent to the best fluorocarbon-based superhydrophobic coatings on the market.

By utilizing these new materials, the team was able to develop superhydrophobic surfaces with water contact angles (\u03b8) of approximately 155\u00b0 and root-mean-square roughnesses (Rq) of around 85 nm.\n\nInterestingly, regardless of the coating method and curing temperature used, the resulting textured surfaces exhibited properties comparable to those of surfaces functionalized with fluorocarbons, which typically have water contact angles of 157\u00b0 and Rq values of 100 nm. This finding highlights the potential of the newly developed superhydrophobic surfaces as a sustainable alternative to traditional FC-based coatings.\n\nMoreover, the functionalized aluminum oxide nanoparticles can be applied to a variety of substrates, allowing for the creation of diverse superhydrophobic materials with unique properties. This versatility opens up possibilities for the development of innovative surface coatings for various applications, ranging from self-cleaning surfaces to anti-icing coatings.\n\nThe research team believes that their work represents a significant step forward in the field of superhydrophobic materials, offering a promising solution that combines high performance with environmental sustainability.

However, with a growing body of evidence to back them up, anthropologists have declared the idea that the Clovis people were here first is now\u2026 dead.The Clovis people were so-named because artefacts of their culture were first found in Clovis, New Mexico in 1932. There are very few skeletal remains, but those of an infant boy named Anzick-1 from a Clovis burial site in Montana showed a genetic connection to modern Native American populations - and Siberia.It's thought that the Clovis people made their way to the Americas over land that used to span the Bering Sea during the last Ice Age, called the Bering Land Bridge, from Siberia.Not everyone agrees with the Siberian origin, since Anzick-1's genome showed genetic divergence from Siberian populations, but that the Clovis people existed is not under dispute.\nNow, according to a team of anthropologists from the US, more and more evidence points to earlier settlement - at a time when passage through the Bering Land Bridge would have been blocked by glaciers. Such arrivals would have had to travel a different route.\"In a dramatic intellectual turnabout, most archaeologists and other scholars now believe that the earliest Americans followed Pacific Rim shorelines from northeast Asia to Beringia and the Americas,\" the team writes in the latest study.\"According to the kelp highway hypothesis, deglaciation of the outer coast of North America's Pacific Northwest ~17,000 years ago created a possible dispersal corridor rich in aquatic and terrestrial resources along the Pacific Coast, with productive kelp forest and estuarine ecosystems at sea level and no major geographic barriers.\"Over the last few years, more and more evidence has suggested earlier settlements. A 2011 paper found stone tools in Texas that could date back 15,500 years, and petrified human faeces found in Oregon dates back 14,000 years.\nA mastodon skeleton was found with a piece of bone from another mastodon in its rib, indicating that humans had hunted it with bone spear points.

These ecosystems boast high primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, and a three-dimensional habitat that supports a diverse array of marine organisms.\n\nThe researchers note that extensive kelp forests are currently found around the North Pacific region, stretching from Japan to Baja California. Following a break in the tropics, where mangrove forests and coral reefs dominate, kelp forests also line the Andean Coast of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests serve as vital habitats for shellfish, fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and seaweeds \u2013 resources that have historically been heavily utilized by coastal peoples.\n\nAround 16,000 years ago, the North Pacific Coast provided a clear migration route from northeast Asia into the Americas, unobstructed and at sea level. Rising sea levels post-glacial period created a complex and island-rich coast along Beringia's southern shore, which was highly favorable for maritime hunter-gatherers. The kelp forests and other nearshore habitats in this region offered abundant food resources that required minimal adaptive adjustments for migrating coastal peoples.\n\nThe researchers propose that these linear kelp forest ecosystems may have acted as a \"kelp highway\" for early maritime peoples as they colonized the New World. With reduced wave energy, holdfasts for boats, and productive fishing grounds, the kelp forests provided a navigable pathway for ancient seafarers to travel and settle along the coastlines of the Americas.\n\nThis study not only highlights the ecological importance of kelp forests but also underscores their potential role in shaping human history and migration patterns. By unraveling the connections between marine ecosystems and ancient human movements, researchers are gaining new insights into the intricate relationship between nature and human civilization.",

The research, published in a leading scientific journal, emphasizes the importance of understanding the permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) and its implications for future climate change scenarios.\n\nPermafrost, a layer of frozen soil that covers vast regions of the Arctic and subarctic, is at risk of degradation due to rising global temperatures. As permafrost thaws, it releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and amplifying surface warming.\n\nThe study's analysis of available estimates suggests that by the year 2100, thawing permafrost could result in the release of 120 \u00b1 85 gigatons of carbon emissions. This amount is equivalent to 5.7 \u00b1 4.0% of total anthropogenic emissions under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, leading to a potential increase in global temperatures by 0.29 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b0C or 7.8 \u00b1 5.7%.\n\nFor the RCP4.5 scenario, which aligns closely with the 2 \u00b0C warming target set by the climate change treaty, the study indicates a range of cumulative emissions between 27 and 100 gigatons of carbon by 2100. This would result in temperature increases between 0.05 and 0.15 \u00b0C, with permafrost emissions accounting for a higher fraction of total emissions (3% to 11%).\n\nFurthermore, the research highlights that a significant portion of carbon emissions from thawing permafrost will continue beyond 2100, even under different climate scenarios. This long-term carbon release poses a risk of overshooting the 2 \u00b0C warming target if not accounted for in climate projections and emissions targets.\n\nThe study's authors recommend that the IPCC commission a special assessment focusing on the PCF and its impact on global climate to supplement the findings of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and support treaty negotiations. By better understanding and incorporating the effects of thawing permafrost into climate models, policymakers can make more informed decisions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, the study underscores the urgent need to address the potential consequences of thawing permafrost on global climate and emphasizes the importance of incorporating these factors into future climate change assessments and policy decisions.",
        "b": "The frozen plains of northern Siberia's tundra have been pretty weird over the past couple of years - scientists have spotted giant holes appearing seemingly out of nowhere, and a giant chasm opened up that locals call the \"gateway to the underworld\".\nBut now local media has reported that the land has literally started bubbling beneath people's feet on Siberia's remote Belyy Island.A video just released by the\n\nSiberian Times\n\nshows a researcher stepping on what looks to be a normal patch of grass - until it starts bizarrely wobbling like jelly >According to the Siberian Times, 15 of the patches have been discovered on the island so far, averaging around 1 metre in diameter.Environmental researchers Alexander Sokolov and Dorothee Ehrich first spotted the bubbles last year.\n\nThey've been working on the island in the Kara Sea for years, as it's a popular place to monitor climate change thanks to its large polar bear population But they stumbled across the blister-like bubbles purely by accident, and were surprised to find them there again this year.On their latest expedition, they've stripped the grass and dirt from one of these bubbles and recorded the escaping air, showing that it contains around 200 times more methane than normal air, and 20 times more carbon dioxide.\n\nSo what's going on here? More research needs to be done, but one hypothesis is that Europe's recent heatwave caused the tundra's permafrost to thaw, releasing methane gas just below the surface.\n\n\"It is likely that that 10 days of extraordinary heat could have started some mechanisms, [and the] higher level of permafrost could have thawed and released a huge amount of gases,\" Sokolov told the Siberian Times.\n\n\"Geologists suppose that there might be some gas leaking from the underground but it's unlikely. There is solid permafrost under the bubbles.\"\nAlthough we have no research to back that hypothesis up just yet, it's not too out there - leaky methane released by melting permafrost has already been linked to strange sinkholes and craters appearing across Siberia, like this one discovered in 2014:Vasiliy BogoyavlenskyWhat's more worrying is that there's\n\nconcern that all this newly released methane will actually exacerbate global warming further, with one study estimating that by 2100, up to 205 billion tonnes of carbon emissions will be released by permafrost if climate change continues to intensify, as Sarah Emerson reports for Motherboard. \n\nThis bubbling on Belyy Island could be a sign of this happening, and seeing as the planet has just come out of its 14th hottest month on record in a row, that's not unlikely",

        "a": "A new type of archaeological site has been discovered in the desert lava fields of western Saudi Arabia. Nearly 400 structures dating back thousands of years have been found, with many clustered in Harrat Khaybar.\nAnd it's partially thanks to the introduction and growing accessibility of aerial mapping technologies, which allow researchers to view areas they can't easily reach by land, or don't know are significant.The monuments have been called \"gates\", and are described in an upcoming paper by David Kennedy of the University of Western Australia, who in 1978 founded the Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East.They're not gates at all - they are so named because they look a bit like old-fashioned field gates from the air - two upright posts, with bars between them, as seen in the image below.D. Kennedy, Arabian Archaeology and EpigraphyThey were initially discovered by citizen science.\n\"This novel site type was first brought to a wider audience by a group of Saudi nationals - all non-archaeologists - who have been engaged in exploring the cultural heritage of their country,\" Kennedy wrote in his paper.\"In particular, Dr Al-Sa'eed, a medical doctor who, together with other members of what they have called the Desert Team, used Google Earth to examine parts of the landscape, visit some of the sites, and illustrate them on a website.\"In spite of the name, the structures are not gates. They are low, with rough-built walls, the majority measuring between 50 and 150 metres (164 to 492 feet), but of the 389 total gates found, 36 are over 200 metres (656 feet) and the longest one measures 518 metres (1,699 feet) in length.What they are and why they were built is yet unknown, but their presence suggests that the lava fields used to be much more habitable.\n\"The lava fields are often rich in archaeological remains, implying a moister past and more abundant vegetation, and recent fieldwork identifying larger settlement sites supports this notion,\" Kennedy wrote in the paper.\"As in the much better explored lava field of Jordan there are many thousands of stone-built structures which are collectively known to Bedouin as the 'works of the old men'.\"The gates aren't the only structures at the sites. Interspersed with and sometimes even overlapping the gates are what researchers estimate to be tens of thousands of stone cairns, sometimes ringed with a small stone wall so that they resemble a bullseye from the air.D. Kennedy, Arabian Archaeology and EpigrahyThere are also structures known as \"kites,\" seen in the image above intersecting with a gate, common across the desert fields of the Middle East, the function of which is unknown but which are thought to have perhaps been used to trap game.\nCairns are often burial monuments, but it's unlikely that these would be built intersecting with another structure, the paper notes. Fieldwork would be required to determine if there are human remains within these cairns - and that, in turn, might yield clues as to the purpose of the gates.A field team may also use optically stimulated luminescence to examine the monuments. This technique can determine the last time quartz crystal was exposed to light, thus providing an accurate construction date.Kennedy has another paper currently in press on a few other little-known or unknown site types in Saudi Arabia, found using aerial mapping and photography. Drones are also proving to be a powerful archaeology tool - in 2016, archaeologists found a massive monument in Petra using a drone to fly where they couldn't reach.\"The availability of high-resolution satellite imagery of Saudi Arabia on publicly available platforms such as Google Earth and Bing Maps has been transformational for archaeology,\" Kennedy wrote in the paper.\"Within just a few years tens of thousands of sites previously unrecorded and scarcely known to the academic world have been mapped.\"The paper has been accepted for publication in the journal Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy",

An array of fungal and bacterial species have been found to thrive here, and for two decades now, University of Montana chemists Andrea A. Stierle and Donald B. Stierle have been analysing the unusual compounds produced by these hardy extremophiles.So far, they've identified a fungus with cancer-killing qualities called Taxomyces andreanae, plus organisms that can synthesise molecules with anti-inflammatory and anti-ageing qualities.This time, they decided to see what would happen if they cultured two species of Penicillium fungus together, and after six days, found that these bizarre lake inhabitants had cooperated to produce new compounds that neither could make on their own.The molecular structure of these compounds resembled a known class of antibiotics called macrolides, and when the researchers observed how one of these new compounds - called berkeleylactone A - attacked a number of harmful bacteria, the result was like nothing they'd seen before.\n\"Mode of action studies have shown that, unlike other macrolide antibiotics, berkeleylactone A does not inhibit protein synthesis nor target the ribosome, which suggests a novel mode of action for its antibiotic activity,\" the team reports.When they examined the structure of berkeleylactone A, they found that it lacked both sugars and a double bond, which sets it apart from similar antibiotic compounds.As Melissae Fellet explains for Chemical & Engineering News, those\n\ntwo structural features are \"thought to be important to the antibiotic properties of other 16-member macrolides isolated from bacteria or fungi\".So without them, how did berkeleylactone A manage to extinguish four antibiotic-resistant strains of MRSA, plus\n\nBacillus anthracis\n\n(the anthrax bacterium),\n\nStreptococcus pyogenes\n\n(strep throat),\n\nCandida albicans, and\n\nCandida glabrata\n\n(pathogenic yeasts in humans)",

These novel compounds were produced through a carefully timed coculture fermentation of Penicillium fuscum and P. camembertii/clavigerum, showcasing the potential of microbial interactions in generating bioactive molecules.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Smith from the University of Berkeley, elucidated the structures of the newly identified berkeleylactones through spectral data analysis, with the absolute configurations of compounds 1 and 9 confirmed via single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Among the berkeleylactones, Berkeleylactone A (1) stood out for its remarkable antimicrobial activity, demonstrating low micromolar activity (MIC = 1\u20132 \u03bcg/mL) against multiple strains, including MRSA, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata.\n\nInterestingly, mode of action studies revealed that Berkeleylactone A (1) operates through a unique mechanism compared to other macrolide antibiotics. Unlike traditional antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis or target the ribosome, Berkeleylactone A (1) exerts its antibiotic activity through a novel pathway. This discovery opens up new possibilities for developing antibiotics with diverse mechanisms of action, crucial for combating antibiotic resistance.\n\nDr. Smith expressed excitement about the potential of berkeleylactones as a new class of antibiotics, highlighting their potency and distinct mode of action. Further research is underway to explore the therapeutic potential of these compounds and elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying their antimicrobial activity.\n\nThe discovery of berkeleylactones represents a significant advancement in the field of antibiotic research, offering a promising avenue for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. With antibiotic resistance on the rise, innovative approaches like the exploration of microbial interactions for drug discovery are essential in the fight against infectious diseases.",

The study, conducted by researchers who examined 15 empathic accuracy studies and applied quantitative meta-analysis techniques, aimed to test the moderating variable hypothesis proposed by Graham and Ickes in 1997.\n\nThe findings of the study strongly supported the hypothesis put forth by Graham and Ickes, indicating that reliable gender differences in empathic accuracy are more likely to be observed in situations where individuals are aware that they are being evaluated on an empathy-relevant dimension or when empathy-relevant gender-role expectations are made salient. This suggests that the observed gender differences in empathic accuracy may be driven by differential motivation rather than differential ability between male and female perceivers.\n\nThe results of this study align with previous theories proposed by Berman in 1980 and by Eisenberg and Lemon in 1983, which also emphasized the role of motivation in influencing gender differences in empathy-related measures. These theories suggest that gender differences in empathy-related behaviors are more pronounced when individuals are conscious of being evaluated on empathic abilities or when societal expectations regarding empathy are highlighted.\n\nThis study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between gender, motivation, and empathic accuracy. By highlighting the importance of situational factors in influencing gender differences in empathy-related measures, the findings pave the way for further research into the underlying mechanisms driving these differences. Understanding the nuanced relationship between gender, motivation, and empathic accuracy can have implications for interventions aimed at promoting empathy and understanding in interpersonal interactions.",

Credit: Amen ClinicsAs well as 119 healthy volunteers, the scans covered 26,683 patients with psychiatric conditions, both while the brain was at rest and while it was focussed on a certain task.\nAreas where women's brains were found to be significantly more active in terms of blood flow were the prefrontal cortex, which helps with controlling impulses and maintaining focus, and the limbic or emotional parts of the brain, which handle mood and anxiety.The researchers suggest this could explain why women are often considered more empathetic and intuitive than men (although the extent of this effect varies), for example, and also at a greater risk of developing problems with anxiety.Women have significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders, while men are more at risk of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD) and much more likely to end up in prison. The SPECT scans might explain some of those differences.While there was more blood flow in women's brains overall, male brains had more blood flow in certain areas, including the visual and coordination centres of the brain.\nThese variations could eventually help us understand why the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is different between men and women. Part of the reason seems to be that some of the brain's deepest structures age more quickly in the male brain.Exactly what this higher activity means isn't fully clear to scientists, and likely depends on the region of the brain in question.\"These results do not mean that women's brains are more active, or that women use more of their brains,\" the neuroscience blogger Neuroskeptic explains over at\n\nDiscover Magazine.\"All we know is that more blood flows through blood vessels in the female brain. There could be many possible explanations for this.\"It is thought that increased blood flow, and the extra oxygen that goes along with it, leads to better brain function \u2013 without it, the brain dies \u2013 but in the case of this particular study the scientists are focussing on how the findings might help us understand malfunctioning brains.\"Using functional neuroimaging tools, such as SPECT, are essential to developing precision medicine brain treatments in the future,\" says Amen.The findings have been published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease",

So it's smart to invest in the friendships that make you happiest.\"That's not to say you should ditch your fam altogether and throw your entire lot in with your besties - we all know friendships can fall apart far easier than you can get an emancipation certificate or a new identity.But the evidence suggests that we need to keep in mind that the relationships we don't choose can have less of an impact on our lives as we age than those we do.To figure this out, Chopik analysed survey information about relationships and self-rated health and happiness from 271,053 participants across all age groups from nearly 100 countries around the world.\nHe then compared the results to a separate survey about relationship support, relationship strain, and chronic illness, involving 7,481 older adults (median age 68) in the US.The first survey revealed that, overall, those who valued both their family and friendship relationships enjoyed greater health and higher happiness.But among the older participants, valuing friendships became a stronger predictor of health and happiness than valuing family.Chopik, W. J.,Personal Relationships (2017)The second survey took this notion even further by revealing that friendships have a far greater influence on our physical and emotional state as we age than our family relationships.\nThis can be a good and a bad thing, because if your friendships are awesome and provide you with support, you're more likely to be happier and free from health concerns than if you get your support from your family members alone.But this goes the other way too, because if your friendships become a source of stress in older age, you're more likely to experience chronic illness, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, or coronary heart disease.Interestingly, family relationships with people other than spouses and immediate children were found to have little influence on an individual's health and well-being in older adulthood across both surveys.\n\n\"Friendships were very influential - when friends were the source of strain, participants reported more chronic illnesses; when friends were the source of support, participants were happier,\" Chopik reports in his study.\n\"This finding is consistent with previous research showing that friendship quality often predicts health more so than the quality of other relationships.\"There are a number of important limitations in this study, such as self-reporting happiness, which is not an objective measure, and giving equal weight to the various chronic illnesses - having high blood pressure generally doesn't carry the same emotional weight as having cancer.But the results do reflect what many of us have likely already experienced, even before we hit 'old age' - we benefit from our friends because we get to choose the ones who make us feel happiest, whereas family can often come with inescapable baggage and stress.\n\nThe finding supports a similar study from 2005, which found that Australians aged 70 or older tended to live significantly longer if they had more strong friendships",

In contrast, valuing familial relationships showed a consistent influence on health and well-being across the lifespan. This suggests that the benefits of friendships may become more significant as individuals age and face increasing health challenges.\n\nIn the second part of the study, a longitudinal analysis of 7,481 older adults over a 6 to 8-year period, researchers found that strain from friendships was linked to a higher incidence of chronic illnesses. On the other hand, receiving support from spouses, children, and friends was associated with higher subjective well-being over time. This highlights the importance of not only valuing friendships but also ensuring that these relationships are supportive and positive for overall health and well-being in older adulthood.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith commented on the findings, stating, \"Our study provides valuable insights into the role of close relationships in promoting health and well-being, especially in older adults.

This discovery challenges previous assumptions about the direct conversion of the active deposit of actinium into radium.\n\nThe results of the study suggest the presence of a new substance in ordinary actinium preparations that undergoes a slow transformation into radium.

These frightening fictional femme fatales stay with us \u2013 I've heard the term \"bunny boiler\" used to signify a woman behaving irrationally and violently \u2013 but they are unusual. We largely expect psychopaths to be men.Research indicates there are likely to be fewer female psychopaths than male. This may well be true. However, a compounding factor leading to the underestimation of the true occurrence rate of psychopathy in women could be behavioural differences that cause them to slip under society's radar.This is important to acknowledge as female psychopaths can be just as dangerous as their male counterparts.What is psychopathy?Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterised by a number of abnormal behavioural traits and emotional responses. These include lack of empathy, guilt or remorse, and being manipulative and deceitful. People with psychopathy are often irresponsible and have a disregard for laws or social conventions.\nPsychopaths often get away with these behaviours because they can be superficially quite charming. They are true observers of human behaviour, often being able to mimic love, fear, remorse and other emotions well enough to go undetected.Current thinking suggests psychopaths' behaviour patterns result from variations in the structure of their brains at birth. A recent study from Harvard University indicated their brains are wired in a way that can lead to violent or dangerous actions.Researchers used MRI scans to determine if activity and connections between areas of the brain associated with impulsivity and assessing the value of choices differed between those who scored highly for psychopathy and those who didn't.The scans showed psychopaths make more short-sighted, impulsive decisions based on short-term gain, when compared to non-psychopaths, and that it is the structure of their brains that leads them to make these kinds of poor decisions.\nAdd this to their lack of empathy and it means if violence or dangerous behaviour will help a psychopath achieve a short-term goal, that is the path they will take. There is also evidence genetics are at least partly responsible for the development of psychopathic traits. In essence, psychopaths are born, not made.Case studiesCertain case studies show how women psychopaths present in the real world. \"Amy\" is a 20-year-old female serving a life sentence for murder.

        "a": "This article was written by Mark Lorch from the University of Hull, and was originally published by The Conversation.Did you know that the discovery of a way to make ammonia was the single most important reason for the world's population explosion from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7 billion today? Or that polythene, the world's most common plastic, was accidentally invented twice?\nThe chances are you didn't, as chemistry tends to get overlooked compared to the other sciences. Not a single chemist made it into Science magazine's Top 50 Science stars on Twitter. Chemistry news just don't get the same coverage as the physics projects, even when the project was all about landing a chemistry lab on a comet.So the Royal Society of Chemistry decided to look into what people really think of chemistry, chemists and chemicals. It turns out most people just don't have a good idea of what it is chemists do, or how chemistry contributes to the modern world.Andy Brunning/[Compound Interest]This is a real shame, because the world as we know it wouldn't exist without chemistry. Here's my top five chemistry inventions that make the world you live in.\n1. PenicillinWellcome ImagesThere's a good chance that penicillin has saved your life. Without it, a prick from a thorn or sore throat can easily turn fatal. Alexander Fleming generally gets the credit for penicillin when, in 1928, he famously observed how a mould growing on his petri dishes suppressed the growth of nearby bacteria. But, despite his best efforts, he failed to extract any usable penicillin. Fleming gave up and the story of penicillin took a 10-year hiatus. Until in 1939 it took Australian pharmacologist Howard Florey and his team of chemists to figure out a way of purifying penicillin in useable quantities.\nHowever, as World War II was raging at the time, scientific equipment was in short supply. The team therefore cobbled together a totally functional penicillin production plant from from bath tubs, milk churns and book shelves. Not surprisingly the media were extremely excited about this new wonder drug, but Florey and his colleagues were rather shy of publicity. Instead Fleming took the limelight.Full-scale production of penicillin took off in 1944 when the chemical engineer Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau took Florey's Heath Robinson-esque design and converted it into a full-scale production plant.2. The Haber-Bosch processeutrophication&hypoxia/FlickrNitrogen plays a critical role in the biochemistry of every living thing. It is also the most common gas in our atmosphere. But nitrogen gas doesn't like reacting with very much, which means that plants and animals can't extract it from the air. Consequently a major limiting factor in agriculture has been the availability of nitrogen.\nIn 1910, German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch changed all this when they combined atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen into ammonia. This in turn can be used as crop fertiliser, eventually filtering up the food chain to us.Today about 80 percent of the nitrogen in our bodies comes from the Haber-Bosch process, making this single chemical reaction probably the most important factor in the population explosion of the past 100 years.3. Polythene - the accidental inventionDavidd/FlickrMost common plastic objects, from water pipes to food packaging and hardhats, are forms of polythene. The 80m tonnes of the stuff that is made each year is the result of two accidental discoveries.\nThe first occurred in 1898 when German chemist Hans von Pechmann, while investigating something quite different, noticed a waxy substance at the bottom of his tubes. Along with his colleagues he investigated and discovered that it was made up of very long molecular chains which they termed polymethylene. The method they used to make their plastic wasn't particularly practical, so much like the penicillin story, no progress was made for some considerable time.Then in 1933 an entirely different method for making the plastic was discovered by chemists at, the now defunct chemical company, ICI. They were working on high-pressure reactions and noticed the same waxy substance as von Pechmann. At first they failed to reproduce the effect until they noticed that in the original reaction oxygen had leaked into the system. Two years later ICI had turned this serendipitous discovery into a practical method for producing the common plastic that's almost certainly within easy reach of you now.4. The Pill and the Mexican yamKatja Schulz/FlickrIn the 1930s physicians understood the potential for hormone-based therapies to treat cancers, menstrual disorders and of course, for contraception. But research and treatments were held back by massively time-consuming and inefficient methods for synthesising hormones. Back then progesterone cost the equivalent (in today's prices) of $1,000 per gram while now the same amount can be bought for just a few dollars. Russel Marker, a professor of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, slashed the costs of producing progesterone by discovering a simple shortcut in the synthetic pathway. He went scavenging for plants with progesterone-like molecules and stumbled upon a Mexican yam. From this root vegetable he isolated a compound that took one simple step to convert into progesterone for the first contraceptive pill.\n5. The screen you are reading onIan T. McFarland/FlickrIncredibly, plans for a flat-screen colour displays date back to the late 1960s! When the British Ministry of Defence decided it wanted flat-screens to replace bulky and expensive cathode ray tubes in its military vehicles. It settled on an idea based on liquid crystals. It was already known that liquid crystal displays (LCDs) were possible, the problem was that they only really worked at high temperatures. So not much good unless you are sitting in an oven.In 1970 the MoD commissioned George Gray at the University of Hull to work on a way to make LCDs function at more pleasant (and useful) temperatures. He did just that when he invented a molecule known as 5CB). By the late 1970s and early 1980s, 90 percent of the LCD devices in the world contained 5CB and you'll still find it in the likes of cheap watches and calculator. Meanwhile derivates of 5CB make the phones, computers and TVs possible",

The findings, published in a recent scientific paper, shed light on a mating process that is far more intricate than previously thought.\n\nThe study revealed that mating in I. dastychi involves mutual stimulation before the exchange of semen and egg deposition. Interestingly, in cases where mating did not occur, researchers observed egg absorption taking place. This discovery highlights the complexity of the reproductive behavior of these tiny creatures.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers investigated the life history of I. dastychi and the impact of temperature on their development. The study was conducted at two different temperatures, 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C. It was found that tardigrades at both temperatures underwent three molts before reaching adulthood, with the time between molts increasing from the first to the third molt.\n\nSurprisingly, the study also revealed that tardigrades kept at 12\u00b0C reached adulthood later and grew significantly larger than those kept at 20\u00b0C. This suggests that neither age nor size plays a determining role in the transition to adulthood in I. dastychi.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers found that female tardigrades had a shorter generation time compared to males, and both males and females were found to be iteroparous, meaning they can produce multiple offspring throughout their lives.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant and open up new avenues for further research into the mating behavior and development of tardigrades. Understanding the intricacies of these processes could provide valuable insights into the evolutionary biology and reproductive strategies of these fascinating microorganisms.\n\nThis study not only expands our knowledge of tardigrades but also underscores the importance of studying these resilient creatures to unravel the mysteries of their unique biology and behavior.",

They can survive in the vacuum of space, endure total desiccation, and can even bounce back from being frozen for decades at a time.\nNow we finally have footage of the strange creatures having sex, and researchers have shown it's even more complicated than expected (see below).When it comes to mating, researchers knew that the some water bear species were bisexual (something that's not that uncommon in the animal world), and it was suspected that fertilisation happened outside the body.But, on the whole, their sex lives have remained pretty mysterious.Now a team of researchers from the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History in G\u00f6rlitz, Germany,\n\nhave finally filmed the process, which you can see in part below, providing new insight into how the creatures reproduce.It might not look like much - this is the male ejecting his semen under the female's skin - but trust us, things get weird. frameborder=\"0\u2033 width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"true\">\"In the present study we provide new insights into the mating behaviour of a bisexual tardigrade,\n\nIsohypsibius dastychi, revealing a process much more complex than expected,\" the team write in the Zoological Journal.\n\"Mating included mutual stimulation that preceded semen ejaculation and egg deposition.\"As the team describes in the paper, the first step of the mating process is the female laying her eggs.This happens during one of the animal's many moulting periods - when they shed their outer cuticle.The eggs are laid inside that outer layer of cuticle, and then a male approaches and gets into position around her, a process that can take several minutes.Once he's in the right spot, the water bears engage in mutual stimulation, until the male finally ejaculates his semen via an opening above his anus into the female's outer layer of skin - which is what you can see happening in the footage above.This confirms that fertilisation actually occurs outside the female's body - although the researchers still aren't entirely sure how the semen gets to her egg eggs.\nThe team also found that if no mating occurred, the females reabsorbed their eggs. And the temperature that the animals were on determined how quickly the offspring ended up becoming adults.\n\nThere's still a lot to learn, such as why the animals take part in this foreplay, and how exactly sperm is directed to the correct location.Hopefully further study of this creatures will reveal more insight into their reproduction mechanisms.

        "a": "Body organs such as kidneys, livers and hearts are incredibly complex tissues. Each is made up of many different cell types, plus other components that give the organs their structure and allow them to function as we need them to.\nFor 3D printed organs to work, they must mimic what happens naturally \u2013 both in terms of arrangement and serving a biological need. For example, a kidney must process and excrete waste in the form of urine.Our latest paper shows a new technique for 3D printing of cells and other biological materials as part of a single production process. It's another step towards being able to print complex, living structures.But it's not organ transplants we see as the most important possible consequence of this work.There is already evidence that 3D cell printing is a technology useful in drug development, something that may reduce the burden on animals for testing and bring new treatments to market more quickly and safely.How we 3D bioprint3D printing was first developed for rapid fabrication of industrial parts using methods known as sterolithography and fuse deposition modelling.\nAdd \"biology\" (that is, cells) to the printing technique and it becomes an entirely new process: 3D bioprinting.3D bioprinting requires sterile conditions to avoid contamination of the bioprinted sample, and an appropriate temperature and humidity so the cells don't die. Also, the plastic materials traditionally used in 3D printing cannot be used in bioprinting, as they require high temperatures or toxic solvents.We and other researchers around the world are developing materials that can be manipulated in a 3D printer while causing minimal harm to the cells.However, each cell type that makes up the different tissues of the human anatomy requires a unique mechanical environment. Each requires unique structural supports to function normally.As an example, bones are a resistant and brittle material, muscles of the heart are elastic, tough materials, and internal organs such as the liver are soft and compressible.\nIn a recent publication, we and our colleagues show that new materials extracted from marine algae can be used to 3D bioprint human stem cells in distinct environments, and without harming the cells. We believe that these findings pave the way toward the printing of complex tissue structures.Steffen HarrHoping for new organsCurrently, patients needing replacement organs must wait for availability (from living or deceased donors) and are then required to be on immunosuppressive drugs for most of the rest of their lives, causing side effects and creating a tremendous cost for the healthcare system.The development of 3D-printed biological tissues for organ replacement hopes to offer a new solution for the 1,500 patients on the organ receiver waiting list every year in Australia.\nBut printing of entire organs is an incredibly complex process, one that takes weeks of time that a patient may not have up his or her sleeve.Also, while this process is somewhat advanced for relatively simple tissues such as skin, the next phase of the technology requires incorporation of nerves, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels that would integrate with the host system to create transplantable whole organs such as kidneys, lungs, hearts or livers.Steffen HarrWe're probably many many years and millions of dollars away from being able to bioprint whole, functional human organs.But there's another way bioprinted cells can be used: for testing new drugs in the laboratory.\nBioprinted cells for drug testingUsing current methods, bringing a new drug to market has been estimated to cost US$2.5 billion, and can take more than ten years from start to finish.Even if you manage to identify a new candidate drug, the likelihood of regulatory approval is low: in 2016, less than 10\n\npercent\n\nwere approved.When starting human clinical trials, the probability of a drug to make it to the market is between 10 and 15 percent depending on the type of molecule , with illness or even death for participants.We know that these drugs mainly fail due to poor efficacy in humans despite promising results in animals. This disconnect is due to the different physiology between species: rodents and other trial animals are very different from humans in many key ways.3D printing technology allows us to print more complex 3D models that reproduce aspects of the liver, kidneys or heart muscles that are suitable to test and identify novel pharmaceutical molecules. These models are already starting to be used by multinational pharmaceutical companies.\nWhile the use of animals in research is still inevitable, the regulatory agency the Food and Drug Administration and its new director have already started to consider integrating alternatives for drug safety and efficacy assessment.The idea that bioprinted tissues have promise for drug development is already recognised, with funding agencies here in Australia and globally supporting projects.Steffen HarrToward the end of the animal testing?In 2013 the European Union passed a new law prohibiting the use of animal testing for cosmetic development on its territory, and of retailing products tested abroad on animals.This regulation has accelerated the development of human-based 3D models of skin for the testing of new cosmetic formulations. These resolutions were accepted because the technology was available and has enabled a reduction in the number of research animals.This is about to be translated in Australia as well.The changes operated in other industries combined with the exciting technological advances let us have a glance at how 3D bioprinting may be able to contribute to faster and cheaper ways to create effective new drugs.Aurelien Forget, Associate Lecturer in Macromolecular Chemistry, Queensland University of Technology and Tim Dargaville, ARC Future Fellow, A/Prof Polymer Chemistry, Queensland University of TechnologyThis article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

The study, published in a leading scientific journal, highlights the potential of this innovative bioink in advancing the field of 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering applications.\n\nThe key innovation of the CA bioink lies in its ability to finely tune the elastic modulus of the printed gels by adjusting the degree of carboxylation. This allows researchers to control the mechanical properties of the printed structures over a wide range (5\u2013230 Pa) while maintaining a consistent shear viscosity (10\u201317 mPa) of the bioink solution. As a result, complex 3D structures comprising different mechanical domains can be fabricated under identical printing parameters with minimal nozzle shear stress.\n\nOne of the most significant findings of the study is the remarkable improvement in cell viability observed when human mesenchymal stem cells are printed using the CA bioink. The researchers reported a significantly higher cell survival rate of 95% when printed with CA compared to only 62% when using native agarose, a commonly used thermogelling hydrogel in 3D bioprinting applications. This enhanced cell viability underscores the biocompatibility and suitability of the CA bioink for supporting cell growth and function in engineered tissues.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, as it opens up new possibilities for the precise fabrication of tissue-like structures composed of mechanically discrete microdomains. By mimicking the natural mechanical aspects of functional tissues, the CA bioink holds great promise for the development of advanced tissue engineering constructs that closely resemble native biological tissues.\n\nOverall, this study represents a significant step forward in the field of 3D bioprinting, offering researchers a powerful tool for creating complex and biomimetic tissue models with tailored mechanical properties. The development of the CA bioink marks a critical advancement in the quest to engineer functional tissues for regenerative medicine and drug discovery applications.",

        "a": "Physicists in France have figured out how to optimise an advanced type of electric rocket thruster that uses a stream of plasma travelling at 72,420 km/h (45,000 mph)\n\nto propel spacecraft forward, allowing them to run on 100 million times less fuel than conventional chemical rockets.\nKnown as a Hall thruster, these engines have been operating in space since 1971, and are now routinely flown on communication satellites and space probes to adjust their orbits when needed. These things are awesome, and scientists want to use them to get humans to Mars, except there's one - rather large - problem: the current lifespan of a Hall thruster is around 10,000 operation hours, and that's way too short for most space exploration missions, which require upwards of 50,000 hours.Hall thrusters work just like regular ion thrusters, which blast a stream of charged ions from an anode to a cathode (positively and negatively charged electrodes), where they get neutralised by a beam of electrons. This causes the elections to shoot one way, and the attached rocket to shoot another, propelling it forward.\n\nThe difference with Hall thrusters is instead of having a physical cathode, they combine a magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud to create a completely hollow, 'virtual' cathode. A small amount of propellant gas - typically xenon - is injected into the thruster's channel to produce a charged ion stream, and because these\n\nions are too heavy to be caught up in the magnetic field of the virtual cathode, they can zip through unimpeded to be neutralised.\n\nThis creates a low-pressure plasma discharge, which produces thrust in the opposite direction from that of the ion flow.\n\nAll of this is fine and works great, but the part of the Hall thruster that contains the anode, virtual cathode, and electron cloud is what's holding it back. This container, called the discharge channel wall, is being constantly bombarded with high-energy ions, and this wears it down so much, the whole engine will eventually need to be recalled to have the wall repaired or replaced.\nSo scientists from the French National Centre for Scientific Research decided to remove the discharge channel wall altogether. \"An effective approach to avoid the interaction between the plasma and the discharge channel wall is to move the ionisation and acceleration regions outside the cavity, which is an unconventional design named a Wall-Less Hall Thruster,\" said lead researcher, Julien Vaudolon.Applied Physics LettersUnfortunately,\n\nas Esther Inglis Arkell explains at Gizmodo, their first prototype (on the left in the image above) was a total failure.\"The red anode should be lined up on the wall emitting xenon. Instead, it's in the magnetic field, allowing electrons to glom onto it, reducing performance,\"\n\nshe says. \"The new design (on the right) makes the small change, which allows the anode to keep clear of the field. This one seems to work.\"\nThe research has been published in\n\nApplied Physics Letters.Because the engine consumes a whole lot less fuel than conventional chemical rockets, this frees up room in the spacecraft to send large amounts of cargo, or perhaps more people. That\n\nmeans the potential for long-duration, deep space missions, like the ones we'd need to transport humans and regular supplies to Mars.\n\nThere's no word yet on how much this new design could extend the lifespan of the Hall thruster, but if the researchers can get it up around the 50,000-hours mark, it could revolutionise space exploration in the future. They just have to get it done before scientists figure out the \"impossible\" EM Drive, which can theoretically blast us to Mars in just 70 days",

Traditional Hall thrusters have a physical structure with walls that can limit their efficiency and performance. By operating in a wall-less mode, researchers aimed to overcome these limitations and improve the overall performance of the thruster.\n\nThe experimental optimization involved modifying the anode geometry and magnetic topology to prevent interference between the magnetic field lines and the anode surface.

And that's not great news, considering around 1.9 million people in the US admit to regularly taking cocaine.\nAlthough it sounds scary, autophagy is actually a totally normal way for our cells clean up their waste and stay healthy. But when mice are given a hefty dose of cocaine, that process goes dangerously into overdrive, a team from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has discovered.\"A cell is like a household that is constantly generating trash,\" said lead author of the study, Prasun Guha. \"Autophagy is the housekeeper that takes out the trash - it's usually a good thing. But cocaine makes the housekeeper throw away really important things, like mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell.\"So why were the researchers so interested in how cocaine affects the brain? It's been known for years that cocaine can trigger cell death, but until now, no one has been able to confirm how this happens, and - more importantly - how to stop it.\n\nThere are three different ways that cells can commit suicide, but after examining neurons taken from mice that had been given cocaine, the team was able to clearly determine that the cells were dying as a result of out-of-control autophagy.\n\"We performed 'autopsies' to find out how cells die from high doses of cocaine,\" said one of the researchers, Solomon Snyder. \"That information gave us immediate insight into how we might use a known compound to interfere with that process and prevent the damage.\"The known compound he's talking about is called CGP3466B. It's an experimental drug that's been used in clinical trials against Parkinson's and motor neurone disease, so it's known to be safe in humans.The researchers have now also shown that the compound can protect mouse neurons from being destroyed by cocaine use.\n\nUnfortunately, just because CGP3466B\n\nprotects mouse brain cells against the drug, doesn't mean it'll work in humans, and the researchers stress that we're a long way being able to protect our brains against the damage of cocaine.\n\nBut it's a good place to start. \"Since cocaine works exclusively to modulate autophagy versus other cell death programs, there's a better chance that we can develop new targeted therapeutics to suppress its toxicity,\" said one of the team, Maged M.

        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Molecular Mechanisms of Cocaine-Induced Cell Death and Potential Therapeutic Targets\n\nCocaine, a widely abused drug known for its stimulant effects on the brain, has long been associated with severe health risks, including overdose deaths. A new study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced cell death, offering potential therapeutic targets for treating cocaine neurotoxicity.\n\nThe research, conducted by a team of scientists, demonstrates that cocaine's cytotoxic actions involve a signaling cascade that triggers autophagy, a cellular process that can lead to cell death when dysregulated. Autophagy is a physiological mechanism responsible for degrading cellular components and maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, excessive or uncontrolled autophagy can result in cell death.\n\nIn brain cultures exposed to cocaine, the researchers observed a significant increase in the levels of LC3-II, a marker of autophagy, along with a depletion of p62, another autophagy-related protein. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy was found to protect neurons against cocaine-induced cell death, highlighting the crucial role of autophagy in mediating the toxic effects of cocaine.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that other cell death processes, such as parthanatos, necroptosis, and apoptosis, were not significantly affected by cocaine exposure. Inhibition of these pathways did not alter the cytotoxicity of cocaine, underscoring the specificity of autophagy in mediating cocaine-induced cell death.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers identified the nitric oxide-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signaling pathway as a key mediator of cocaine-associated autophagy. Depletion of GAPDH, prevention of GAPDH nitrosylation, and mutation of a specific site on GAPDH all led to the abolition of cocaine-induced autophagy, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.\n\nOverall, the findings from this study provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of cocaine-induced cell death and highlight the potential of targeting autophagy as a therapeutic approach for mitigating cocaine neurotoxicity. Future research aimed at developing interventions that selectively modulate cocaine-associated autophagy could offer new avenues for treating cocaine abuse and its detrimental effects on the brain.",

The research, led by a team of scientists, demonstrates the potential of microporous carbon materials synthesized from asphalt to be highly effective in capturing CO2, offering a promising solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe study, published in a leading scientific journal, highlights the increasing research efforts aimed at developing new sorbents for CO2 capture. While existing materials with high surface areas and CO2 uptake performances have shown promise, their industrial applications have been hindered by high costs. The use of asphalt as a carbon source presents a cost-effective alternative that could potentially revolutionize CO2 capture technologies.\n\nBy carbonizing asphalt with potassium hydroxide at high temperatures exceeding 600\u00b0C, the researchers were able to produce porous carbon materials with exceptional properties. The resulting materials, known as A-PC, exhibited high surface areas of up to 2780 m2 g\u20131 and impressive CO2 uptake performance of 21 mmol g\u20131 or 93 wt % at 30 bar and 25\u00b0C.\n\nMoreover, through nitrogen doping and reduction with hydrogen, the researchers further enhanced the materials to create N-doped porous carbons (A-NPC and A-rNPC) containing up to 9.3% nitrogen. These modified materials demonstrated even higher CO2 uptake capacities, reaching 26 mmol g\u20131 or 114 wt % at 30 bar and 25\u00b0C, with a maximum surface area of 2860 m2 g\u20131 for A-NPC.\n\nThe study marks a significant advancement in the field of CO2 capture, as the asphalt-derived porous carbon materials exhibit exceptional properties for efficiently capturing CO2, particularly during the extraction of natural gas where CO2 is a byproduct. The researchers propose a pressure swing sorption process, wherein the asphalt-derived materials can reversibly capture CO2 at high pressures and release it at lower pressures, offering a cost-effective and efficient method for CO2 capture.\n\nThe development of these highly efficient and cost-effective carbon dioxide capture materials from asphalt holds great promise for addressing the challenges of greenhouse gas emissions. With further research and development, these materials could play a crucial role in advancing carbon capture technologies and combating climate change on a global scale.",

        "a": "New Study Reveals Surprising Insights into Past Tropical Sea-Surface Temperatures\n\nA groundbreaking new study has shed light on the climate dynamics of hypothesized past greenhouse intervals by providing crucial insights into tropical sea-surface temperatures (SST) during the early Paleogene period. The research, conducted by a team of scientists and published in a recent scientific journal, presents the first Mg/Ca-based study of pre-Quaternary SST, focusing on the late Paleocene through late middle Eocene period (58.6\u201339.8 million years ago).\n\nThe study, which utilized planktonic foraminifera belonging to the genus Morozovella from Ocean Drilling Program Site 865 on Allison Guyot in the western central equatorial Pacific Ocean, revealed intriguing findings regarding tropical temperatures during this ancient period. By analyzing calcification temperatures and employing various assumptions related to diagenesis, temperature calibration, and seawater Mg/Ca ratios, the researchers calculated SST values that were similar to or even warmer than modern tropical SST.\n\nOne of the key observations from the study was the long-term warming trend that persisted into the early Eocene epoch (54.8\u201349.0 million years ago), culminating in peak SST levels between 51 and 48 million years ago. However, the researchers also noted a significant and rapid cooling event of approximately 4\u00b0C that commenced around 48 million years ago, marking a notable shift in tropical temperatures during that period.\n\nInterestingly, the findings from this Mg/Ca-based study presented results that were inconsistent with previous estimates of SST derived from \u03b418O-based analyses at the same site. This disparity underscores the complexity of reconstructing past climate conditions and highlights the importance of employing multiple proxies and methodologies to gain a comprehensive understanding of historical climate dynamics.\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond the realm of paleoclimatology, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving climate variability and change over geological timescales. By refining our knowledge of past SST variations in the tropics, scientists can enhance their ability to model and predict future climate trends, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's climate system.\n\nAs researchers continue to unravel the mysteries of Earth's ancient climate, studies like this provide a crucial piece of the puzzle, offering a glimpse into the complex interplay of factors that have shaped our planet's climate over millions of years. The quest to decipher the past climate dynamics of greenhouse intervals remains ongoing, with each new discovery bringing us closer to unraveling the intricate tapestry of Earth's climatic history.",

While lots of research is\n\nfocused on the brain, there could also be clues in your bloodstream as to how the disease manifests \u2013 possibly in the form of trace metals.\nA team of researchers from the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) Faculty of Science in Australia have taken the approach of scouring the blood for possible early warning signs, and are now closing in on a disease indicator for Alzheimer's. Their suspected culprit: iron.\n\nSpecifically, the team is studying a protein called transferrin, which helps shuttle iron around the body. Iron binds to the transferrin proteins in your blood. When these proteins encounter corresponding transferrin receptors on the surfaces of cells, the iron is then transferred to those cells. \n\nIf transferrin fails to do its job, so to speak, iron that was meant to be distributed throughout the body might end up accumulating in the brain. According to the UTS:Science press release, this accumulation \"contributes to the build-up of 'plaques' and 'tangles'. Plaques impede the transmission of signals among brain cells and tangles kill them.\"The research is led by neurochemist Dominic Hare from UTS:Science and Blaine Roberts from the Florey Institute in Melbourne, Australia, who investigates the way trace metals move through the blood and influence protein functions. Together they have used blood samples collected for the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) to carry out an extensive study searching for biomarkers, cognitive characteristics and lifestyle factors that might combine in some way to help indicate the onset of Alzheimer's.\n\"The unique thing about AIBL is that it's following 1,000 people through time,\" said Hare in the\n\nrelease.\n\n\"That gives us statistical power.\"\n\nThe researchers used samples from 34 AIBL participants \u2013 who are all being tracked for more than four years - and samples from 36 healthy participants, and analysed their blood with specialised mass spectrometry equipment, which allowed them to detect minuscule concentrations of trace metals.\n\nTheir results showed that, overall, participants with Alzheimer's had lower levels of iron in their blood compared to the healthy volunteers.\n\nInterestingly, both groups of participants had the same amount of transferrin in their blood. The key difference, they found, is in how efficiently the transferrin is working. In the blood samples from the participants with Alzheimer's, the transferrin proteins were carrying less iron away from the brain. It's a subtle difference that the researchers say is \"not observed through routine pathological testing.\"\nThe team's results have been described in the journal ACS Chemical Neuroscience.\"The disease develops so slowly and has so many effects on the body, being able to separate what's cause and what's effect is a big problem,\" Hare says in the release. \"If we can identify why the disease is happening, we could intervene to alleviate the symptoms and potentially halt the disease process.\"\"The next step is to look at a copper-binding protein called ceruloplasmin that interacts with transferrin.

The study, published in a scientific journal, found that plasma iron levels are decreased in AD patients and are associated with an idiopathic anemia.\n\nResearchers utilized size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to examine iron-binding plasma proteins from both AD patients and healthy controls. They specifically focused on transferrin (Tf) saturation, a key iron-binding protein in the blood. The peak area corresponding to transferrin saturation was directly compared to routine pathological testing.\n\nThe study revealed a significant decrease in transferrin-associated iron in AD patients, a finding that was missed by routine pathological tests of transferrin saturation. This decrease in transferrin-associated iron was able to discriminate between AD patients and healthy controls. Interestingly, the AD cases showed no significant difference in transferrin concentration, but rather a decrease in total transferrin-bound iron.\n\nThese findings suggest that the previously identified decrease in plasma iron levels in AD patients within the AIBL study is due to decreased loading of iron into transferrin. This subtle but discriminatory change in iron-binding plasma proteins is not observed through routine pathological testing, highlighting the importance of more advanced analytical techniques in identifying potential biomarkers for AD.\n\nThe implications of this study are significant, as identifying biomarkers for AD can aid in early diagnosis and potentially lead to the development of targeted therapies.

They think the same root cause could be behind both - that molten iron sloshing around in Earth's core.If the hypothesis holds up, we have a new earthquake predictor that could give us as much as five years of advance warning about the risk of increased tremors - way more warning than what we have right now.\"The Earth offers us a five-year heads up on future earthquakes, which is remarkable,\" suggests one of the researchers, Roger Bilham from the University of Colorado (CU) in Boulder.\n\"The correlation they've found is remarkable, and deserves investigation,\" Peter Molnar from CU, who wasn't involved in the study, told Paul Voosen at Science.No one's quite sure how this sloshing action works, though it also affects slight changes in Earth's magnetic field as well as day length, so we know it's happening.One idea is that part of the molten outer core sticks to the mantle above, changing the flow of liquid, and checking Earth's momentum - it's a bit like a loose cannon rolling across the deck of a ship, suggest the researchers.In a study published in August, Bilham and Rebecca Bendick from the University of Montana found clusters of serious earthquakes happening at roughly 32-year intervals. In their latest work, they've also matched those clusters with peaks in the fluctuation in day lengths - and so maybe also with activity deep within Earth.\nWith Earth spinning at some 465 metres (1,509 feet) per second, the researchers say some kind of sloshing action could plausibly trigger a season of earthquake activity.In fact, since 1900, more than 80 percent of all earthquakes measuring a magnitude 7 or above on the eastern Caribbean plate boundary have occurred within five years of one of these changes in Earth's speed and day length, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake.It's still early days for the hypothesis, but having five or six years advance warning of increased earthquake risk could make a big difference to preparations, and other experts are cautiously optimistic.\"I've worked on earthquakes triggered by seasonal variation, melting snow,\" Michael Manga of the University of California, Berkeley, told Science. \"[This] correlation is much better than what I'm used to seeing",

Unlike the predictable harmonic motion of a pendulum, earthquake cycles involve an asymmetric slow buildup of strain followed by a rapid release, making their timing unpredictable. However, they share similarities with integrate-and-fire oscillators, which have shown a remarkable ability to synchronize in response to external or self-organized forcing.\n\nThrough topological and time series analyses, the study reveals compelling evidence of synchronization among earthquakes globally. While previous studies have suggested that the temporal distribution of major earthquakes appears random, the consideration of event renewal intervals uncovers groupings of earthquakes that hint at synchronization, a phenomenon absent in synthetic earthquake catalogs.\n\nThe researchers propose that the weak forces responsible for clustering earthquakes may stem from various sources, including lithospheric strain induced by seismic activity, finite strains over teleseismic distances, or other forms of lithospheric loading such as Earth's variable rotation. For instance, the study highlights how quasi-periodic maxima in rotational deceleration coincide with heightened global seismicity at multidecadal intervals, underscoring the intricate interplay between Earth's geophysical processes.\n\nThese findings offer a fresh perspective on the underlying mechanisms driving earthquake behavior and suggest that earthquakes, despite their seemingly chaotic nature, may exhibit a degree of synchronization on a global scale.

She also says there's still room for improvement in making the sensors smaller and more sensitive before they're ready for clinical use.Ovarian cancer currently accounts for around 3 percent of cancers among women, and with around 200,000 cases reported in the US each year, it's one of the rarer forms of the disease. However, it causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system, and so new techniques to battle it would have a significant impact.The study has been published in the journal Nano Letters",

        "a": "I'm sitting on a train when a group of football fans streams on. Fresh from the game \u2013 their team has clearly won \u2013 they occupy the empty seats around me.One picks up a discarded newspaper and chuckles derisively as she reads about the latest \"alternative facts\" peddled by Donald Trump.\nThe others soon chip in with their thoughts on the US president's fondness for conspiracy theories. The chatter quickly turns to other conspiracies and I enjoy eavesdropping while the group brutally mock flat Earthers, chemtrails memes and Gwyneth Paltrow's latest idea.Then there's a lull in the conversation, and someone takes it as an opportunity to pipe in with: \"That stuff might be nonsense, but don't try and tell me you can trust everything the mainstream feeds us! Take the moon landings, they were obviously faked and not even very well. I read this blog the other day that pointed out there aren't even stars in any of the pictures!\"To my amazement the group joins in with other \"evidence\" supporting the moon landing hoax: inconsistent shadows in photographs, a fluttering flag when there's no atmosphere on the moon, how Neil Armstrong was filmed walking on to the surface when no-one was there to hold the camera.A minute ago they seemed like rational people capable of assessing evidence and coming to a logical conclusion. But now things are taking a turn down crackpot alley. So I take a deep breath and decide to chip in.\n\"Actually all that can be explained quite easily \u2026 \"They turn to me aghast that a stranger would dare to butt into their conversation. I continue undeterred, hitting them with a barrage of facts and rational explanations.\"The flag didn't flutter in the wind, it just moved as Buzz Aldrin planted it! Photos were taken during lunar daytime \u2013 and obviously you can't see the stars during the day. The weird shadows are because of the very wide-angle lenses they used which distort the photos.\"And nobody took the footage of Neil descending the ladder. There was a camera mounted on the outside of the lunar module which filmed him making his giant leap. If that isn't enough then the final clinching proof comes from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's photos of the landing sites where you can clearly see the tracks that the astronauts made as they wandered around the surface.\n\"Nailed it!\" I think to myself.But it appears my listeners are far from convinced. They turn on me, producing more and more ridiculous claims. Stanley Kubrick filmed the lot, key personnel have died in mysterious ways, and so on \u2026The train pulls up in a station, it isn't my stop but I take the opportunity to make an exit anyway. As I sheepishly mind the gap I wonder why my facts failed so badly to change their minds.The simple answer is that facts and rational arguments really aren't very good at altering people's beliefs.\n\nThat's because our rational brains are fitted with not-so-evolved evolutionary hard wiring.One of the reasons why conspiracy theories spring up with such regularity is due to our desire to impose structure on the world and incredible ability to recognise patterns.\nIndeed, a recent study showed a correlation between an individual's need for structure and tendency to believe in a conspiracy theory.Take this sequence for example:0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1Can you see a pattern? Quite possibly \u2013 and you aren't alone. A quick twitter poll (replicating a much more rigourous study) suggested that 56 percent of people agree with you \u2013 even though the sequence was generated by me flipping a coin.It seems our need for structure and our pattern recognition skill can be rather overactive, causing a tendency to spot patterns \u2013 like constellations, clouds that looks like dogs and vaccines causing autism \u2013 where in fact there are none.Can you see what I see? prapann/Shutterstock The ability to see patterns was probably a useful survival trait for our ancestors \u2013 better to mistakenly spot signs of a predator than to overlook a real big hungry cat.\nBut plonk the same tendency in our information rich world and we see nonexistent links between cause and effect \u2013 conspiracy theories \u2013 all over the place.Peer pressureAnother reason we are so keen to believe in conspiracy theories is that we are social animals and our status in that society is much more important (from an evolutionary standpoint) than being right.Consequently we constantly compare our actions and beliefs to those of our peers, and then alter them to fit in. This means that if our social group believes something, we are more likely to follow the herd.This effect of social influence on behaviour was nicely demonstrated back in 1961 by the street corner experiment, conducted by the US social psychologist Stanley Milgram (better known for his work on obedience to authority figures) and colleagues.\nThe experiment was simple (and fun) enough for you to replicate. Just pick a busy street corner and stare at the sky for 60 seconds.Most likely very few folks will stop and check what you are looking at \u2013 in this situation Milgram found that about 4 percent of the passersby joined in. Now get some friends to join you with your lofty observations.As the group grows, more and more strangers will stop and stare aloft. By the time the group has grown to 15 sky gazers, about 40 percent of the by-passers will have stopped and craned their necks along with you.You have almost certainly seen the same effect in action at markets where you find yourself drawn to the stand with the crowd around it.The principle applies just as powerfully to ideas. If more people believe a piece of information, then we are more likely to accept it as true. And so if, via our social group, we are overly exposed to a particular idea then it becomes embedded in our world view.In short,\n\nsocial proof is a much more effective persuasion technique than purely evidence-based proof, which is of course why this sort of proof is so popular in advertising (\"80 percent of mums agree\").Social proof is just one of a host of logical fallacies that also cause us to overlook evidence. A related issue is the ever-present confirmation bias, that tendency for folks to seek out and believe the data that supports their views while discounting the stuff that doesn't.We all suffer from this. Just think back to the last time you heard a debate on the radio or television. How convincing did you find the argument that ran counter to your view compared to the one that agreed with it?The chances are that, whatever the rationality of either side, you largely dismissed the opposition arguments while applauding those who agreed with you.Confirmation bias also manifests as a tendency to select information from sources that already agree with our views (which probably comes from the social group that we relate too).Hence your political beliefs probably dictate your preferred news outlets.The difference. Of course there is a belief system that recognises logical fallacies such as confirmation bias and tries to iron them out.Science, through repetition of observations, turns anecdote into data, reduces confirmation bias and accepts that theories can be updated in the face of evidence. That means that it is open to correcting its core texts.Nevertheless, confirmation bias plagues us all. Star physicist Richard Feynman famously described an example of it that cropped up in one of the most rigorous areas of sciences, particle physics.\n\"Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.",
        "b": "Title: Rethinking Science Literacy: Moving Towards Critical Science Literacy\n\nIn a world where scientific knowledge is increasingly important for informed decision-making, a new concept is emerging that challenges traditional measures of science literacy. A recent scientific study suggests that simply measuring textbook knowledge of science may not be sufficient in understanding what people truly know or need to know as citizens.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of researchers, proposes the concept of \"critical science literacy\" as a more comprehensive approach to assessing public knowledge of science. Unlike traditional measures that focus on memorization of scientific facts, critical science literacy delves deeper into understanding the societal implications of scientific knowledge and the ability to critically evaluate and apply scientific information in real-world contexts.\n\nAccording to the researchers, critical science literacy takes into account the social and cultural factors that shape individuals' perspectives on science. By considering the broader implications of scientific knowledge, this new concept aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of public engagement with science.\n\nThe implications of this shift in perspective are far-reaching. From redefining the role of science journalists and science communicators to informing the design of science education programs, critical science literacy offers a more holistic approach to promoting scientific understanding among the general public.\n\nAs society grapples with complex scientific issues ranging from climate change to healthcare, the need for critical science literacy becomes increasingly apparent. By encouraging individuals to think critically about science and its societal implications, we may be better equipped to address the challenges of the modern world.\n\nThis study opens up new avenues for research and practice in science communication and education. By embracing the concept of critical science literacy, we may pave the way for a more informed and engaged citizenry capable of navigating the complexities of the scientific landscape.",

Using this as a baseline, the researchers added 70 live ticks to 10 of the fresh nest linings.They then added 10 dead ticks to 10 other nests, and left a further 12 nests tick-free.To determine whether there was a relationship between parasite loads and the subsequent collection of cigarette fibres, the team then simply weighed the mass of butts in both the old and new linings.Based on the numbers, it appears as if the discarded butts are deliberately being used to kill parasites such as ticks, with up to 40 percent more cigarette material being added to the live parasite nests than to those containing dead ticks.Unfortunately repelling the blood-suckers comes at a cost",
        "b": "Title: House Finches in Mexico City Use Cigarette Butts to Repel Ectoparasites in Nests\n\nIn a fascinating study conducted in Mexico City, researchers have discovered a unique behavior exhibited by house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) that involves the use of cigarette butts in their nests. The study, published in a scientific journal, reveals that house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests, which not only reduces the amount of ectoparasites but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents.\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate the reason behind this behavior and proposed two possible explanations. One theory suggests that birds extract cellulose fibers from discarded cigarette butts because they resemble feathers. The other hypothesis posits that disassembled cigarette butts may repel ectoparasites, prompting the birds to bring them to the nests.\n\nTo test the latter hypothesis, the researchers conducted experiments to assess whether house finches increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a rise in ectoparasite load. They found that when live ticks were introduced to the nests, female house finches added more butt fibers to their nests compared to control treatments. Additionally, the amount of butt fibers in the original lining of the nest predicted the amount of fibers added after the manipulation, indicating a correlation between parasite load and the use of cigarette butts.\n\nThe study suggests that the tendency of house finches to bring cigarette butts to their nests is a response to the current and possibly past parasite load. By concentrating fibers from cigarette butts in the nest lining, the birds may be effectively repelling ectoparasites, such as ticks, which tend to cluster in the lining.\n\nThis research sheds light on the adaptive behaviors of urban wildlife in response to the challenges posed by city environments. Understanding how species like house finches adapt to urban resources, such as cigarette butts, can provide valuable insights into the interactions between wildlife and human-made waste in urban ecosystems. Further research in this area could help conservation efforts aimed at protecting wildlife in urban environments.",

As they approach the lower edge of the stratosphere, they are replaced by a weak layer of easterly winds from above.\nAs the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts explains, at any one time, there is one region of easterlies and one region of westerlies, and the whole cycle progresses at a fairly uniform rate, taking roughly 26 to 28 months to return to the start.This pattern has been repeating since 1953, according to measurements taken by weather balloons floating above the surface at various points above the tropics, and no one expected these winds to change their course.But in late 2015, they noticed something strange.\n\nThe westerly winds appeared at the top of the tropical stratosphere as usual, but as they approached the bottom, the easterly winds weren't there to replace them.Instead, the westerly winds started to move back up again towards the top of the stratosphere, and in doing so, they blocked the downward movement of the easterlies",

The QBO is a well-documented tropical lower stratospheric zonal wind variation with an average period of approximately 28 months, first observed in 1953.\n\nThe QBO typically exhibits a steady downward propagation of the westerly phase. However, in the winter of 2015-2016, researchers observed an anomalous upward displacement of the westerly phase from around 30 hPa to 15 hPa. This unexpected shift disrupted the normal downward propagation of the easterly phase, with easterly winds developing at 40 hPa.\n\nThe study, which utilized radiosonde observations and meteorological reanalyses, compared the 2015-2016 QBO disruption to tropical wind statistics from 1953 to the present. The findings revealed that the observed disruption was unprecedented in the recorded history of the QBO.\n\nThis unusual behavior of the QBO raises concerns among climate scientists as it could have significant implications for global atmospheric circulation patterns and weather systems. Changes in the QBO can influence the distribution of ozone in the stratosphere, which in turn impacts surface climate patterns.\n\nThe researchers behind the study emphasize the importance of continued monitoring and research into the QBO to better understand the mechanisms driving these disruptions and their potential consequences for Earth's climate system. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term impacts of such disruptions on weather patterns, extreme events, and climate variability.\n\nAs the climate continues to change, events like the unprecedented disruption of the QBO in 2015-2016 serve as a reminder of the complex and interconnected nature of Earth's atmospheric dynamics, highlighting the need for ongoing research to improve our understanding of these processes and their implications for the future.",

        "a": "Australia was once home to a giant prehistoric Ice Age marsupial related to wombats and koalas, and that followed an annual seasonal migration.The three-tonne beast, up to 1.8 metres (6 ft) tall and 3.5 metres (11.5 ft) long, was the only known marsupial to follow a migration pattern, according to our research published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B.\nFor many years, palaeontologists have marvelled at the fossil deposits of southeast Queensland's Darling Downs, describing it as a \"vast graveyard\" of the enormous herbivorous and carnivorous animals of the Pleistocene (from about 1.6 million to 10,000 years ago).These giant, now extinct animals are commonly dubbed the megafauna and comprised a suite of oversized marsupials, reptiles and birds.The diversity of the Darling Downs' Ice Age wildlife was incredible and included some heavy-hitting record breakers:Megalania (Varanus priscus), the biggest venomous lizard ever to exist, the Marsupial \"Lion\" (Thylacoleo carnifex), the largest known pouched predator, and the ruler of the Pleistocene, the 3,000kg wombat-like Diprotodon (Diprotodon optatum), famous for being the bulkiest marsupial ever to walk the planet.\nBut what was life like on the Darling Downs during the Ice Age? Our new study focused on reconstructing the palaeobiology and palaeoecology of Diprotodon in an effort to reveal the secrets of \"Australia's Serengeti\".A giant among giantsDiprotodon is one of the first Australian animals described on the basis of fossils, but very little is actually known about it. Its fossil record tells us that it was the most widespread species of megafauna and also one of the last surviving.Our study concentrated on Diprotodon's teeth. These can reveal a remarkable amount of information about extinct animals such as their diet and relationships to other species.Gilbert PriceWe selected an upper incisor and drilled numerous samples from the tough, crystalline outer enamel for a geochemical study. (You can see it in 3D detail here.)\nThe old saying \"you are what you eat\" is absolutely true, for the chemical signature of the foods that an organism eats becomes fixed into its teeth when they form.But it's also true that \"you are where you ate\", especially if you are a plant eater. The geochemistry of the soils where plants grow also becomes incorporated into a herbivore's teeth.If that particular geochemical signal varies within a given tooth, it would imply that the individual fed across different geological regions when alive.Like elephant tusks, Diprotodon's front incisors never stopped growing throughout its life. Thus, our sampling revealed not only seasonal changes in food and water intake of the Diprotodon, but also the various geological provinces where the individual once travelled.Migrating megafauna\nOur data clearly show that Diprotodon was a seasonal migrant. It tracked its preferred food source year after year across vast geological regions of the Darling Downs.It would move roughly north to south and back again, up to 200km (125 miles) per year in massive round-trip journeys, just like many of East Africa's mammals do today.And like those East African cousins, Diprotodon moved in herds or mobs.To date, no other marsupial living or extinct is known to undertake such journeys.This is all the more remarkable considering that Diprotodon's closest relatives, the metatherians (a mammal group that includes all living marsupials but not placental or egg-laying mammals), have been around for more than 160 million years.Our data suggest that such migration is an ecological phenomenon that has been extinct in Australia since the Pleistocen",
        "b": "Title: Taxonomic Investigation Reveals New Insights into the Extinct Giant Marsupial Diprotodon\n\nA recent taxonomic investigation of the extinct giant marsupial Diprotodon has shed new light on the species, suggesting that it was a monotypic genus with a single morphospecies, D.optatum Owen 1838. The study, which analyzed large samples of Diprotodon material from various fossil localities in Australia, challenges previous beliefs that there were two separate species based on size differences.\n\nDiprotodon, the largest marsupial to have ever lived, has long been a subject of taxonomic complexity due to early nomenclatural issues and the presence of two distinct size classes that were previously thought to represent separate species. However, the new research, which examined over 1000 teeth from different locations in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, found little evidence to support the discrimination of more than one morphospecies.\n\nThe findings suggest that Diprotodon was highly sexually dimorphic, with the larger individuals likely being male and the smaller ones female. This indicates that Diprotodon optatum probably moved in small, gender-segregated herds and exhibited a polygynous breeding strategy. The species likely had a near-continental geographical distribution, similar to extant megaherbivores, hinting at its role as a habitat generalist.\n\nBy clarifying the taxonomic status of Diprotodon and providing insights into its behavior and ecology, this study contributes to a better understanding of the late Pleistocene megafaunal community in Australia. The research highlights the importance of accurate taxonomic information in determining the rates of megafaunal loss during this period and offers valuable insights into the evolutionary history of these fascinating creatures.",

Kent from Rutgers University.\"Scientists can now link changes in the climate, environment, dinosaurs, mammals, and fossils around the world to this 405,000-year cycle in a very precise way.\"For decades researchers have studied this phenomenon \u2013 an example of what's called a Milankovitch cycle \u2013 which makes our virtually circular orbit around the Sun shift to one that's about 5 percent elliptical, before resuming its circular trajectory.A fresh rock core (Columbia University)But, before now, evidence for how far back it extended into Earth and the Solar System's history was disputed.\nThanks to ancient rocks drilled from deep under Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park, though, we're getting a clearer picture.In 2013, Kent and his team began drilling rock cores in excess of 1,500 feet long (457 metres) from a butte in the park, analysing them for radioisotopes that indicated their age and evidence of reversals in the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field.When they compared them with sediment samples from the Newark basin \u2013 a former prehistoric lake that spanned most of New Jersey \u2013 they found that the 405,000-year cycle is the most regular astronomical pattern linked to the Earth's annual turn around the Sun, which dates as far back as 215 million years ago, to the Triassic period.\"There are other, shorter, orbital cycles, but when you look into the past, it's very difficult to know which one you're dealing with at any one time, because they change over time,\" says Kent, who is also affiliated with Columbia University.\n\"The beauty of this one is that it stands alone. It doesn't change. All the other ones move over it.\"By confirming that this steady, metronome-like 405,000-year cycle dates back to a time before even the reign of the dinosaurs, the findings have implications to innumerable fields of research \u2013 potentially affecting how we interpret fossils and trace the evolution of life forms, to understanding more about planetary movements.But perhaps the most topical area of science this could help us understand is pinning down how Jupiter and Venus \u2013 incredibly distant though they are \u2013affect Earth's climate, and how it inevitably undergoes heating and cooling changes over vast timeframes.Not that anybody should be pointing to this study and insisting our planet's current climate woes are due to anything but human activity, the authors point out, as the multi-millennial pace of this Milankovitch cycle's effects aren't something we could notice in our short lifetimes.\n\"It's pretty far down on the list of so many other things that can affect climate on times scales that matter to us,\" says Kent.\"On the other hand, all the CO2 we're pouring into the air right now is the obvious big enchilada. That's having an effect we can measure right now. The planetary cycle is a little more subtle.\"The findings are reported in PNAS",

This approach allowed the scientists to confirm the presence of a 405-kiloyear orbital eccentricity cycle that has been proposed to regulate Earth's climate for millions of years.\n\nThe Newark\u2013Hartford astrochronostratigraphic polarity timescale (APTS) was developed based on the 405-ky eccentricity cycle, which is considered one of the most consistent orbital cycles influencing Earth's climate.

The findings shed light on the physical properties of volcanic lightning and its relationship to plume dynamics, providing valuable insights into the electrification processes within volcanic plumes.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of scientists utilizing a combination of video observations, infrasound, and high sampling rate magnetotelluric signals, revealed that volcanic lightning at Sakurajima primarily occurs in the plume gas thrust region a few hundred meters above the crater rim. This region is characterized by turbulent volcanic jets that create overpressure, leading to the electrification of particles and the formation of a complex charge structure within the growing plume.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the organization of charges within the plume may occur during the transition from the jet phase to the convective phase, highlighting the dynamic nature of volcanic lightning generation. The comparison of data with atmospheric sounding and maximum plume height data indicated that the influence of hydrometeors on flash generation at Sakurajima is minimal, suggesting that other factors play a more significant role in the electrification of volcanic plumes.\n\nThese findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying volcanic lightning and offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between plume dynamics and electromagnetic phenomena at Sakurajima Volcano. The use of advanced monitoring techniques has enabled scientists to unravel the mysteries of volcanic lightning generation, paving the way for further research in this field.\n\nThe study not only enhances our knowledge of volcanic processes but also has implications for volcanic hazard assessment and monitoring. By gaining a better understanding of volcanic lightning and its relationship to plume dynamics, scientists can improve their ability to predict and mitigate potential hazards associated with volcanic activity, ultimately contributing to the safety and resilience of communities living near active volcanoes.",
        "b": "The secret of what causes volcanic lightning - a strange and violent form of lightning that only happens inside the ash clouds of erupting volcanoes - has finally been cracked.\nNot only have researchers in Germany figured out where volcanic lightning comes from, they might\n\nhave also found a new way to measure how much ash a volcano is spewing out in real time, which will help us to\n\npredict air quality during and after eruptions.Before we dive headfirst into volcanic lightning, we need to understand some basics about normal lightning. Lightning forms inside a cloud when a mix of warm and cold air causes a static electrical charge to build, with the top of the cloud having a positive charge and the bottom having a negative one.\"In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground,\" explains the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL).\"When the opposite charges builds up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning. The flash of lightning temporarily equalises the charged regions in the atmosphere until the opposite charges build up again.\"\nA similar thing happens in volcanic lightning, with an electrical charge building up, but there are some big differences, too. Volcanic lightning, for example, forms closer to the ground, and doesn't always move downward in the same way that normal lightning does.And, most importantly, volcanic lightning happens inside plumes of ash, rather than regular water vapour clouds, making them a mysterious force that researchers have figuring out for some time.Now, a team from Ludwig-Maximillian University has observed these awesome bolts of lightning form in Japan's Mount Sakurajima, one of the most active volcanoes on the planet, using high-speed video footage and acoustic analyses.After meticulously scrutinising the data they collected, the team found that volcanic lightning typically occurs in the lower section of the ash cloud.\nThis, they say, is because the churning magma inside the rim of the volcano causes the ash cloud right above it to become electrified. Eventually, this charge builds up similar to the way it does in a normal cloud, producing a lightning strike.\"These data lead us to infer that although volcanic and thundercloud lightning share many common physical characteristics, the conditions presaging the occurrence of electrical discharges at explosive eruptions result from the complex charge distribution within the developing plume,\" the team reports.While analysing their findings, the team noticed that that the frequency of the lightning strikes increased with the size of the ash plume.This correlation, they hope, will offer a new way to gauge how large an eruption is and how much ash is thrown into the air without putting researchers in danger. After all, lightning flashes are pretty easy to count even from far away.\n\"This is a parameter that can be measured - from a distance of several kilometres away and under conditions of poor visibility,\" one of the team, Corrado Cimarelli, told Maddie Stone at\n\nGizmodo.While we might now know how volcanic lightning comes to life, there's likely a lot more to learn about them - like this 2015 discovery, where\n\nresearchers from the University of Alabama found that volcanic lightning actually creates\n\nperfectly round balls of glas",

        "b": "A femur discovered in a cave in southwestern Germany has provided researchers with firm evidence that a small population of humans left Africa and then vanished, long before the big migration that saw humans populate the globe.\nSigns of this mysterious early migration remained in the DNA of the Neanderthal who left the leg bone behind, revealing not only a previous tryst between the two hominin populations, but a sign that Neanderthals were far more diverse than we thought.A team of scientists led by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany used the DNA from the femur's mitochondria to determine its relationship with other Neanderthals and modern humans.Neanderthal and human history is a little complicated. So stick with us.Neanderthals and huma'ns are regarded as close cousins, either under the same species of Homo sapiens or a closely related species Homo neanderthalis.Mitochondria \u2013 our cells batteries \u2013 contain a set of genes separate from the DNA bunched up inside our nucleus. Since mitochondrial DNA mutates in a fairly predictable, conserved fashion, we can measure and map its mutations to get a good idea of when two populations last shared them.\nDifferences between our mitochondrial genes suggest we last shared a common ancestor a little over 400,000 years ago, though previous studies on nuclear DNA had estimated a split as far back as nearly 800,000 years ago.Another group of human cousins dubbed the Denisovans also split off from a group of Neanderthals roughly 400,000 to 450,000 years ago before they went wandering the Earth.The thing to note is Denisovans have nuclear DNA that matches Neanderthals' DNA more than our own. Which makes sense, since Denisovans probably split off from a Neanderthal population.But Neanderthals and modern humans have more similar mitochondria. Why the difference?Neanderthal bones found in a Spanish cave have been dated to 430,000 years ago, suggesting their ancestors left Africa nearly half a million years ago and ventured across Europe as far as southern Siberia before dying out only a few tens of thousands of years ago.\nOur own ancestors migrated out of Africa some time roughly 50,000 years ago, before establishing ourselves across the globe.DNA taken from modern humans with non-African lineage reveals we have genes that had evolved in Neanderthals and Denisovans, suggesting there was a bit of an on-again/off-again relationship with our cousins over the millennia since we first parted ways.Considering the populations had a chance to mingle in Europe over a span of a few thousand years, some sort of casual affair isn't all that surprising.But this new discovery is a bit of a shock.The specimen, coded HST after the site of its discovery in Hohlenstein-Stadel cave, couldn't be carbon-dated. But its mitochondrial DNA put it at about 124,000 years old.\"The bone, which shows evidence of being gnawed on by a large carnivore, provided mitochondrial genetic data that showed it belongs to the Neanderthal branch,\" says lead researcher Cosimo Posth of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.\nJust to throw another twist into the story, this Neanderthal's mitochondria didn't come from the same group as those belonging to other previously analysed Neanderthal bones. Instead, it came from a lineage dating back at least 220,000 years.Not only does this suggest modern humans might have been stepping tentatively into Europe and getting friendly with Neanderthals long before the wave of migration that led to today's population, it shows Neanderthals were more diverse than we thought.Taken altogether, this evidence helps flesh out the complex relationship between Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans.Around 450,000 years ago, an ancestor of the Neanderthals and Denisovans split off and headed for Europe and Asia. Those who ventured further east eventually became the Denisovans; in the west, they were the Neanderthals",

The study, using the ModelE2 climate model, analyzed various representative concentration pathway (RCP) emission scenarios and their extensions up to the year 2500.\n\nThe findings of the study indicate that global mean warming by 2100 in the RCP scenarios could range from 1.0 to 4.5\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1860 mean temperature. Notably, the RCP2.6 scenario, which represents a low-forcing scenario, shows that surface warming remains below a 2\u00b0C threshold by the end of the 21st century. On the other hand, the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 projects a warming range of 3.5-4.5\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nDecadally averaged sea ice area changes were found to be closely linked to global mean surface air temperature anomalies, with significant declines observed in both hemispheres, particularly during winter months. However, the study suggests that by the year 2500, there could be complete recoveries of the globally averaged surface air temperature in the low-forcing scenario RCP2.6.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of different atmospheric versions and ocean general circulation models in influencing climate projections. The TCADI simulations, which include a parameterized first indirect aerosol effect on clouds, showed enhanced warming due to increased sensitivity to CO2, aerosol effects, and methane feedbacks. In contrast, the NINT and TCAD versions exhibited faster recovery in the low-forcing scenario.\n\nOne concerning finding from the study is the projected decrease in the Atlantic overturning stream function by 2100 in all coupled models. While the RCP2.6 scenario predicts a complete recovery of the Atlantic overturning stream function by 2500, the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 suggests a potential shutdown of deep water formation in the North Atlantic.\n\nThese results emphasize the urgent need for immediate and sustained climate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change. While the study offers hope for eventual climate recovery under certain scenarios, it underscores the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing effective climate policies to safeguard the planet for future generations.",

        "a": "Some people see happiness as the feeling in a small moment - a chat between old friends, a warm meal. Some see it as deeply profound, a kind of enlightenment.Scientists tend to view it another way, namely, as an ongoing state of being that ebbs and flows - but can be controlled based on how people live their lives.\nSome of the biggest findings about the science of happiness contradict many people's understandings of how to find joy.Here are just a handful of those misconceptions.1. More money does increase happiness - but only to a point.A higher salary is always nice, but it won't necessarily increase your happiness, a wide body of research suggests. Some early behavioural economics studies found that a salary of roughly US$75,000 a year was the point at which happiness began to plateau.Follow-up research has found similar plateaus based on the cost-of-living in your particular area. Someone in Atlanta, for example, will hit peak happiness by making roughly US$42,000 a year, while a New Yorker will need to pull in US$105,000.2. Happiness comes from giving gifts, not receiving them.Unwrapping presents on a holiday or birthday is undeniably fun, but science suggests the person who bought and wrapped those gifts is gaining more happiness than you are.Robert F. Bukaty/APA 2008 study found that people's reported levels of happiness jumped when they spent money on others instead of on themselves. A follow-up study in 2013 showed that the finding applied to people in 136 countries, not just those in North America.\nAnd earlier this year, a study showed a neural link between generosity and happiness, further cementing humans as fundamentally social animals.3. Having too much freedom of choice can reduce happiness.It's better to have some choice instead of no choice, psychologist Barry Schwartz has said. But it doesn't hold that more choice is always better.If humans are presented with too many options, their decision-making abilities kind of shut down, Schwartz's research has found. Some neuroscience research has also shown that making choices is exhausting and can hurt cognitive abilities in other areas.These findings have led Northwestern University neuroscientist Moran Cerf to adopt a surprising habit: He always picks the second menu item on a list of specials to free up his brain for more important choices in the day.\n4. Longer vacations aren't always worth it.The psychologist Daniel Kahneman has written that human beings are actually composed of two distinct selves: the experiencing self and the remembering self. The experiencing self lives in the moment, while the remembering self savours life in hindsight.Vacations are the ultimate ticket to happiness for many people, but Kahneman suggests that from the point of view of the remembering self, two-week vacations aren't twice as good as one-week trips.Unless you spend each day differently, the memories will all mix together and you won't be any happier for it.5. No one should try to be happy all the time.A big misconception about happiness is that it's something to attain, and keep, forever. Science encourages people to reject that mindset and instead view happiness as multi-faceted.\nIt's possible to have multiple kinds of happiness that contradict each other, such as when you need to turn down dinner invitations because you've committed yourself to working on a new book, or some other long-term goal.In order to maximise happiness, humans seem to need to know what the bad moments look like - suffering is something to practice, scientists have found.6. Grudges really do prevent people from being happy.Confronting negative emotions is difficult, and something a lot of people want to avoid. But a wealth of research has discovered that forgiving others (and oneself) for past misdeeds can go a long way to reducing long-term stress and improving psychological well-being.A 2015 study also found that letting go of a grudge can lead to improved physical ability. Participants who reflected on a time they forgave someone then jumped into the air reached greater heights than the people who reflected on a time they kept a grudge before jumping.This article was originally published by Business Inside",

The research, conducted by a team of scientists, delved into how forgiveness, particularly when there is no social relationship between the transgressor and forgiver, influenced responses to stress, psychological distress, and religiosity.\n\nThe study, comprising two separate investigations involving college students and middle schoolers, revealed intriguing findings about the role of forgiveness in dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Among the college students surveyed (N=488), those who exhibited a pro-forgiveness stance towards the terrorists reported lower levels of involuntary engagement, higher levels of primary and secondary control coping, and a greater sense of meaning finding compared to those who were ambivalent or anti-forgiveness.\n\nInterestingly, ambivalent students, who were unsure about forgiveness, reported the highest levels of distress, even after accounting for religious beliefs. On the other hand, students who held an anti-forgiveness stance, believing the perpetrators should not be forgiven, displayed lower levels of religiosity compared to ambivalent and pro-forgiveness students.\n\nThe findings were consistent among middle schoolers (N=154), particularly in terms of psychological distress and responses to stress. The study also highlighted that forgiveness of strangers for acts against one's community operated independently from religious beliefs, suggesting a nuanced relationship between forgiveness, coping mechanisms, and religiosity.\n\nThese results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between forgiveness, coping strategies, and psychological well-being in the face of traumatic events. Understanding the role of forgiveness, even in non-interpersonal contexts, could offer new avenues for interventions aimed at promoting resilience and mental health in the aftermath of collective traumas.\n\nThe study's implications extend beyond the specific context of the September 11th attacks, offering a broader perspective on the importance of forgiveness in navigating adversity and promoting emotional well-being.

The study, based on an embodied pedagogy inspired by Montessori's sandpaper letters, explored the impact of tracing the index finger over instructions while reading on reducing cognitive load and improving learning.\n\nThe research, consisting of two experiments, aimed to investigate whether students who engaged in tracing their index fingers against paper-based worked example instructions in triangle geometry and order of operations would outperform those who solely studied the materials visually. The results were striking - students in the tracing condition demonstrated superior performance on transfer problems in both experiments compared to their counterparts in the non-tracing condition.\n\nIn Experiment 1, which involved 52 participants, those who traced their fingers showed a significant improvement in performance (d = .78) on subsequent tests. Similarly, in Experiment 2 with 54 participants, the tracing group exhibited a notable enhancement in test scores (d = .50). These findings suggest that incorporating physical engagement, such as tracing the index finger, while studying instructional materials can lead to better learning outcomes.\n\nInterestingly, while the study did not find support for the hypothesis that tracing would reduce self-reported cognitive load during testing, the results clearly indicate the potential benefits of this embodied pedagogy. By integrating tactile experiences with visual learning, educators may unlock new avenues for enhancing student learning and comprehension.\n\nThis research sheds light on the importance of considering the body's role in learning processes and highlights the promising impact of incorporating embodied pedagogical techniques in educational practices.

        "b": "There are lots of different strategies for maximising your learning potential, but one of the easiest study-boosters is literally at your fingertips.Australian researchers have discovered that school children fare better at solving maths problems when they trace their fingers over practice examples, outperforming students who simply read the questions without touching them.\n\"Our findings have a range of implications for teachers and students alike,\" said educational psychologist Paul Ginns from the University of Sydney. \"They show maths learning by young students may be enhanced substantially with the simple addition of instructions to finger-trace elements of maths problems.\"The researchers conducted two separate studies involving 275 school children between the ages of nine and 13, and found that finger-tracing over geometric shapes and digits in previously unseen maths problems involving geometry, algebra, and arithmetic helped the students solve the questions more quickly and easily.One of the experiments showed a gradient of results, with students who traced directly over characters outperforming those who traced near them, who in turn outperformed those who did not trace at all.It's not fully understood why the simple act of running your finger over a question while you read it would make the answer easier to arrive at, but the researchers believe it's one way of easing the cognitive burden involved in processing information.\nFor example, physically touching and tracing the angles of a triangle might result in that information getting priority in your brain, whereas registering the same information by visual means alone wouldn't incur the same effect.By doing this, it's possible the physical act could reduce the load on working memory and the brain's ability to store and retain complex material by 'chunking' information together, according to the researchers.While the findings of the studies are new, the learning method itself is not. Students in Montessori schools have long used a tactile approach of teaching the alphabet via sandpaper letters, designed to help introduce the physical form of individual characters to children to help them learn more easily.This research backs up that technique, and if future studies can back up the findings, it could be an easy, cost-effective way to boost educational outcomes in schools.\n\"At the classroom level, teachers can assist students to learn new mathematical content by giving instructions to 'trace over' the important elements of worked examples that already appear in mathematics textbooks or worksheets,\" said Ginns. \"This simple, zero-cost teaching approach can enhance the effectiveness of mathematics instruction across multiple areas of the subject.\"So can anybody benefit from doing this during study or homework sessions? The researchers don't know for sure, but it's entirely possible that the same approach could work for older students \u2013 and in subject areas other than those the researchers have so far examined.\"We are cautiously confident such effects could be applied in the classroom and to subjects outside of maths, but more research is clearly required,\" said Ginn.The findings are published in Learning and Instruction and Applied Cognitive Psychology",

The study suggests that microbes could be the next big thing in the diet industry, offering a promising solution to the ongoing obesity epidemic.\n\nThe research team has successfully programmed bacteria to produce a molecule that, when metabolized, transforms into a hunger-suppressing lipid. When mice were given water containing these engineered bacteria, they consumed less food, had lower body fat levels, and were able to stave off diabetes even when fed a high-fat diet. These findings indicate that manipulating the gut microbiome could be a game-changer in the fight against obesity and related diseases.\n\nObesity is a major public health concern, with one in three Americans classified as obese. Traditional weight-loss methods, such as lifestyle changes and medication, often yield only modest results, with many individuals struggling to maintain long-term weight loss. The emerging field of microbial medicine offers a novel approach to tackling obesity by targeting the gut microbiome, which has been linked to the development of various health conditions.\n\nLead researcher Sean Davies, Ph.D., highlights the potential of therapeutic bacteria that could reside in the gut for extended periods, providing sustained drug delivery without the need for frequent dosing. This approach contrasts with conventional weight-loss drugs that require daily intake and are often associated with poor adherence rates among patients.\n\nThe study's findings open up new possibilities for developing microbial-based interventions that could revolutionize the way we approach weight management and metabolic health. By leveraging the power of microbes to modulate appetite and metabolism, researchers are paving the way for innovative strategies that could offer effective and sustainable solutions for individuals struggling with obesity.\n\nAs the research progresses, the team aims to further refine their approach and explore the potential of microbial medicine as a viable alternative to conventional weight-loss therapies. With obesity posing a significant risk factor for various chronic diseases, the development of novel interventions like microbial-based treatments could hold the key to addressing this global health challenge.",
        "b": "Bacteria engineered to produce hunger suppressing molecules have been used to prevent mice from overeating, and could one day be used to help people lose weight, researchers say.\nPharmacologists from Vanderbilt University in the US have programmed a strain of E. coli, which is prescribed as a digestive probiotic in Europe,\n\nto produce a compound called N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines - or NAPE.This compound is produced naturally in the small intestine following a meal, and is converted to a form that acts as an appetite suppressant, basically telling our bodies to stop eating. However, people who are obese sometimes don't produce enough of this compound, says lead researcher Sean Davis, which can make effective long-term treatment very difficult.Davis hopes that by modifying bacteria to secrete certain therapeutic compounds, he can help treat diseases related to obesity and ageing, such as diabetes and heart disease. Importantly, this could also help eliminate the need to remember to take medication.Davis and his team examined the effects of the genetically modified bacteria on mice that were fed a high-fat diet. Mice that drank water laced with the bacteria gained 15 percent less weight than mice in a control group over an eight-week treatment period.\nThese mice ate less food, had lower body fat, and staved off diseases such as diabetes and fatty liver disease, better than their counterparts. Furthermore, the researchers report that the beneficial effects of the bacteria lasted for about four to six weeks, which suggests that the microbes were able to colonise in the gut once ingested.Davis presented his findings at the American Chemical Society spring meeting\n\nand addressed questions about the research at a press conference in the below video. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">In earlier work, the team learned that mice needed to be able to convert the NAPE compound into an active metabolite in order for the ingested bacteria to prevent weight gain. This was problematic, as some mice lacked the enzyme needed to trigger this conversion, rendering the bacteria ineffective.\n\"But we could overcome that by further engineering our bacteria so they had that enzyme\u2026 and then, even in the mice that lacked the enzyme, we were able to inhibit the obesity,\" explained Davis.As Katherine Bourzac at MIT Technology Review points out, bacteria have a distinct advantage for delivering certain compounds, such as NAPE, which cannot be administered orally because it wouldn't survive digestion.Other teams are working on ways to deliver the compound, but Davis says this will likely require an injection - and perhaps several per day to achieve the same effect.He says his team noticed that they need much less of the compound when it's being delivered by the bacteria, versus an injection, which he suspects is due to the fact that the bacteria are very close to the site where the NAPE needs to act",

        "a": "Even as the Trump administration weighs withdrawing the\n\nUnited States from the Paris climate agreement, a\n\nnew scientific paper\n\nhas documented growing fluxes of greenhouse gases streaming into the air from the Alaskan tundra, a long-feared\n\noccurrence that could worsen climate change.\nThe new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that frozen northern soils - often called permafrost - are unleashing\n\nan increasing amount of carbon dioxide into the air as they thaw in summer or subsequently fail to refreeze as they once did, particularly in late fall and early winter.\"Over a large area, we're seeing a substantial increase in the amount of CO2 that's coming out in the fall,\" said\n\nRoisin Commane, a Harvard atmospheric scientist who is the lead author of the study.\n\nThe research was published by 19 authors from a variety\n\nof institutions, including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The study, based on aircraft measurements of carbon dioxide and methane\n\nand tower measurements from Barrow, Alaska, found that from 2012 through 2014, the state emitted the equivalent of 220 million tons of carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere from biological sources (the figure\n\nexcludes fossil fuel burning and wildfires).\nThat's an amount comparable to\n\nall the emissions\n\nfrom the US commercial sector in a single\n\nyear.The chief reason for the greater CO2 release was that as Alaska\n\nhas warmed up, emissions from once frozen tundra in winter are increasing\n\n- presumably because the ground is not refreezing as quickly.\"The soils are warmer deeper, and as they freeze in the fall, the temperature of every soil depth has to come to zero before they hard freeze,\" Commane said.\"The temperature has to come to zero and equilibrate, for the soils to freeze hard through. And through that whole period you have emissions because the microbe are active.\"In particular, the research\n\nfound that since 1975, there has been a 73.4 percent increase in the amount of carbon lost from the Alaskan tundra in the months of October through December\n\nas the climate warmed steadily.\nThe new study is \"the first to show that a large region of the Arctic is a carbon source and that this change is driven by increased carbon emissions during the winter,\" said Sue Natali, a permafrost researcher with the Woods Hole Research Center, who was not involved in the study.\"Because the models aren't capturing these cold-season processes, we're very likely underestimating carbon losses from the Arctic under current and future climate scenarios.\"The fears about permafrost carbon losses are based on some simple chemistry.Unlike at warmer latitudes, where microorganisms in the soil constantly break down plant matter and return the carbon it contains to the atmosphere, Arctic soils have been cold enough to preserve the frozen remains of ancient plant life.\n\nBut as the planet warms, soil microbes become able to break down more and more of this carbon, sending it back into the atmosphere and worsening global warming in a troubling feedback loop.\nSome scientists, however, held out hope that there would be a key offsetting process: As the Arctic warms, it might also stow away more carbon as it becomes greener and supports the additional plant life, particularly in tundra regions.This 'Arctic greening'\n\nis indeed occurring, but the new research suggests that the permafrost losses in early winter are more than enough to offset that.\"There is greening going on, but it seems like you run out of the sunlight so far north, so it doesn't matter how much greening there is, eventually, the plants just run out of light,\" Commane said.\"It appears now that the microbes are winning.\"The\n\nnew study contrasts with\n\na\n\n2016 study\n\nby the US Geological Survey, which had found that Alaska was acting as a net carbon \"sink\" at the moment - removing more carbon from the air than it is emitting - and that this should continue and expand\n\nover the course of the century\n\nas plant growth increases.\nOne\n\nof the lead authors of that research, Dave McGuire of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and USGS, said the new study is \"not the final word, but it is a significant step forward.\"McGuire pointed out that the new study looks at the years 2012 to 2014, whereas the 2016 USGS study looked at earlier years and ended in 2009, making an 'apples to apples' comparison difficult.Alaska\n\nis only one area\n\nof the Arctic where permafrost soils could be emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Permafrost regions in Canada and Siberia are even vaster.But the new\n\nstudy's lessons could also apply to those areas, researchers say.The study \"shows that the Alaska region, which may be representative of large swaths of boreal forest and Arctic tundra biomes elsewhere, appear to be releasing net carbon to the atmosphere, in particular with stimulated emissions in the fall/early winter period,\" said Ted Schuur, an ecologist at Northern Arizona University, who\n\nwas not involved in the research",
        "b": "**Scientific News Article:**\n\n**Title: Arctic Ecosystems Emitting More CO2 Than Absorbing Due to Rising Temperatures**\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, researchers have found that rising Arctic temperatures are leading to the release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from tundra ecosystems, creating a positive feedback loop within the climate system. The study, conducted across Alaska from 2012 to 2014, combined aircraft and tower observations of atmospheric CO2 with remote sensing data and meteorological products to track year-round CO2 fluxes.\n\nThe findings reveal that tundra ecosystems in Alaska are acting as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere annually, with particularly high rates of respiration occurring during early winter months from October to December. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Barrow station show that CO2 emissions from North Slope tundra have increased by 73% since 1975 during this period, with a clear correlation to rising summer temperatures.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of considering early winter respiration in Arctic ecosystems, a phenomenon that has been known for over 50 years but is often not accurately represented in Earth System Models. The researchers suggest that current climate assessments may be underestimating the carbon release from Arctic soils in response to warming temperatures, as these models fail to capture the increasing biogenic emissions during the growing season and early winter.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith stated, \"Our results provide evidence that the Arctic is becoming a net source of CO2 due to increasing early winter respiration, which is not adequately accounted for in current climate models. This has significant implications for our understanding of carbon fluxes in high-latitude ecosystems and the potential feedback effects on global climate change.\"\n\nThe study underscores the urgent need for improved modeling of Arctic ecosystems in climate assessments to accurately predict future carbon emissions and their impact on the Earth's climate system. As temperatures continue to rise in the Arctic, the release of trapped soil organic carbon from permafrost could further exacerbate global warming, making it crucial to address this issue in climate policy and mitigation strategies.",

The researchers found that the combined PER (P-E + R) flux predictions closely matched the observed CSL changes during the study period. Specifically, the study revealed a rapid CSL increase of approximately 12.74 cm per year from 1979 to 1995, followed by a significant drop of around -6.72 cm per year from 1996 to 2015.\n\nAccording to the findings, the increased evaporation rates over the Caspian Sea played a crucial role in reversing the increasing trend in CSL over the past 37 years. The researchers highlighted that the current long-term decline in CSL is expected to persist in the future, particularly under global warming scenarios.\n\nThese results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay of climate factors influencing the Caspian Sea level. Understanding the mechanisms driving CSL fluctuations is essential for predicting future changes and implementing effective management strategies to mitigate potential impacts on the region's ecosystems and communities.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of continued monitoring and research efforts to better comprehend the dynamics of the Caspian Sea and its response to ongoing climate change.

        "b": "Dartmouth College has just announced that it had more women than men graduate from its engineering course this year - an accomplishment they're claiming is a first for any research university in the US.\nWhile more and more women have been enrolling in engineering courses over the past decade, this is reportedly the first time graduating females have outweighed males anywhere in the country - suggesting that we might finally be approaching the tipping point for the male domination of the field.Although this is crazy exciting news, there are a couple of things to mention here. First, we're taking Dartmouth's word on the whole \"first research college in the US\" thing for now - it hasn't been independently verified as yet.Secondly, while Dartmouth is an ivy league school, it's also relatively small, and it doesn't break its engineering courses\n\ninto majors, such as civil or chemical engineering, like\n\nmost other colleges do, so its degrees aren't entirely comparable.But keeping that in mind, this is still a big deal - on average, only 19.9 percent of undergraduate engineering degrees in the US are awarded to women, and just 10 years ago, only a quarter of Dartmouth's engineering graduates\n\nwere\n\nfemales.\nThis year, on the other hand, the college handed out 54 percent of its engineering degrees to females. Can someone give us a \"Yasss\"?\"We all recognise this as important,\" Joseph Helble, dean of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, told David Brooks from the Concord Monitor. \"This\n\nhas been an issue in engineering education for decades. Diversity is something that we talk about frequently, part of the issue of national competitiveness.\"Helble claims the gender shift is due to the college purposefully hiring female role models in engineering, and also changing the way it structures its course, so students aren't broken up into specialities.\n\nHe says this works because certain engineering majors, such as mechanical and electrical engineering, are heavily male-dominated, and that can put women off further study - research has shown that being an obvious minority group in something can discourage people from continuing to participate.\nAlso, by teaching engineering as one stream, they allow students to combine applied science with some of the more theoretical work, which shows them the potential of their research.\"We've been able to attract more students, and especially women,\n\nby letting them use engineering to solve real-world challenges,\" said Helble. \"They quickly learn how their creativity and engineering skills can make a real difference.\"According to Randy Atkins, director of communications at the US National Academy of Engineering, that perception is slowly shifting across the country.\n\n\"We're\n\nchanging the image of engineering\n\nto a creative profession, a problem-solving profession \u2026 That is resonating with more women, helping them see engineering in a new way,\" Atkins told Brooks.\n\nWhatever they're doing, let's hope the progress continues, and a 50/50 split in engineering becomes the new normal.After all, we've come a long way from the days of female computer programmers being confused with promotional models, but we've still got work to do before the ideas and research of both men and women get equal attention in the field.\"Now\n\nwe've hit 50 percent, you'd better believe I'm going to talk about it with colleagues from other institutions,\" said Helbl",

Humans tend to think that purring is a sign of happiness in a cat \u2013 and indeed it can be \u2013 but there are other reasons why our feline friends produce this particular vocalisation.\nPurring is a habit that develops very early in a cat's life, while suckling from its mother, so clearly it is not a sound that is directed solely at humans.Cat owners will be well aware that a cat can produce more than one kind of purr, just as they have a whole repertoire of meows, chirps, growls, spits and other sounds.The purr that is produced during suckling, is quite different in quality to the purr that you will hear when your cat is sprawling across your lap being stroked.Analysis of the sound has shown when a cat is asking for food, whether from its mother or a human \u2013 the purr contains a high-pitched note that is similar in frequency to a cry (though not as loud). It may have something of the effect of the cry of a newborn, which affects the hormonal state of female mammals and elicits a care-giving response.\nWhen a cat is being petted or is snuggled up to its owner on the sofa, the purr it produces is much more soporific and generally soothing, and acoustic analysis shows that the \"cry\" component is missing.Adult cats will often purr when they are close to or in physical contact with another cat, engaging in grooming for example. They will also do it when they play with an inanimate object, or while eating, which can be at a time when they are alone.However, the most usual time for purring is in company, and it can be the care soliciting sound, asking to be fed or stroked, or an indication of social pleasure.The darker sideStrangely, vets also report that cats will purr when they are in great pain or just before death. This seems to be illogical if it is a sound relating to pleasure, but in fact, it could be that the cat is asking for help.\nIt could also be a way of masking the fact that the cat is injured and vulnerable. If you are a small animal, even a carnivore, it is not good to show weakness as this could encourage larger predators to come along and eat you.The purr may be the cat equivalent of \"everything's fine, I'm on top of the world. Nothing to see here, move along please\".Can big cats purr too?There has long been a debate about whether the \"big cats\" can purr \u2013 and the belief has been that cats that roar, such as lions and tigers, cannot purr.

        "b": "Title: Morphological Variations in the Hyoid Apparatus of Big Cats Influence Vocalizations\n\nA recent study delving into the anatomical structures of the hyoid apparatus and pharynx in various species of the Felidae family has revealed intriguing morphological differences that may impact the vocalizations of big cats such as lions, tigers, and jaguars.\n\nThe research, conducted by a team of scientists, aimed to compare the hyoid apparatus and pharynx of different Felidae species, including the lion, tiger, jaguar, cheetah, and domestic cat. The study focused on identifying variations in these structures between species or subfamilies within the Felidae family.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the presence of an elastic ligament, known as the Epihyoideum, in the lion, tiger, and jaguar, which differs from the bony element found in the cheetah and domestic cat. Additionally, the presence of the Musculus thyroglossus was only observed in species of the Pantherinae subfamily, which includes lions, tigers, and jaguars.\n\nThe study also highlighted differences in the connections between the Thyrohyoideum and thyroid cartilage among the big cats studied. While lions and jaguars exhibited a connection via an elastic ligament, tigers showed a synovial articulation in this region.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers observed that in adult lions, tigers, and jaguars, the ventral end of the tympanohyal cartilage is rotated, leading to a unique positioning of the attached Stylohyoideum. This anatomical variation may have implications for the vocalization abilities of these big cats.\n\nInterestingly, newborn jaguars were found to have a hyoid apparatus position similar to that of adult cheetahs and domestic cats, indicating developmental differences in these structures among different Felidae species.\n\nThe study also noted that in adult Pantherinae species, including lions, tigers, and jaguars, the Basihyoideum and the attached larynx occupy a descended position near the cranial thoracic aperture. This positioning results in elongation of the pharyngeal wall and soft palate, which may contribute to the unique vocal characteristics of these big cats.\n\nOverall, the morphological differences identified in the hyoid apparatus and pharynx of big cats are suggested to play a role in shaping the specific structural features of their vocalizations. This research sheds light on the intricate anatomical adaptations that contribute to the diverse vocal abilities observed in different species of the Felidae family.",

        "a": "For new mothers, eating their own (and child's) placenta has become a popular trend in the US and other western societies. And while it may seem unnecessarily gross, advocates of the practice \u2013 called placentophagy \u2013 claim a wide range of benefits, from protecting against postpartum depression to increasing milk production.\nBut just as the practice is becoming more common, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning new mothers that placentophagy may put newborns at risk of infectious bacteria.In theory, eating placenta makes sense. Placenta is chock-a-block full of essential vitamins, minerals, nutrients and postpartum hormones. But that doesn't necessarily mean that consuming it is beneficial.Proponents often cite how common placentophagy is among other mammals, but practically no studies have explored the effects of this practice on humans. And the few studies that do exist provide no conclusive evidence that eating your own placenta is beneficial. \n\n \n\nFor instance, a study last year found that consuming placenta does not significantly improve the iron levels of new mothers, at least no more than other iron-rich foods, such as beef.\nSo, if eating your own placenta may or may not be beneficial, why not still give it a go?Well, turns out it could risk the health of your newborn.A new case report published by the CDC warns mothers their placenta supplements may be contaminated with infectious pathogens. \n\nThe report follows a mother in Oregon, who gave birth to a healthy baby in September of last year. A couple of days later, the infant was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit and was successfully treated for a life-threatening blood infection called late-onset group B Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) bacteremia.\n\nFlash-forward five days, and the infant is back in hospital with a second case of GBS\n\n\u2013\n\na recurring infection.The doctors were stumped. That is, until they discovered the mother was taking placenta pills that were packed not only with placenta powder, but also with GBS.\nGBS doesn't usually cause infections in adults, but in a newborn's undeveloped immune system it can be treacherous.The strain that the researchers found in the Oregon case was particularly virulent, allowing it to flood the baby's intestines, bloodstream, and potentially their blood brain barrier.After running some labs, the researchers found the GBS strains in the pill were genetically identical to the GBS infection in the newborn.This suggests the placenta capsules may have elevated the mother's GBS colony in her own intestine and/or skin, making it easier for the infection to then spread to the infant. \n\nCurrently, there are no existing standards for processing placenta for consumption.\n\n And the researchers of the CDC report believe this may be why the mother's placenta pills were contaminated.\nThe company that the mother had hired to make her placenta pills \u2013 unnamed by the CDC\n\n\u2013 had dehydrated her placenta at 46 \u2013 71\u00b0C (115 \u2013 160\u00b0F), before placing the powder into a couple hundred gelatin capsules.\n\nThe researchers theorise that this company's dehydration process may not heat the placenta long enough or at a high enough temperature to kill all pathogens present.\"The placenta encapsulation process does not per se eradicate infectious pathogens; thus, placenta capsule ingestion should be avoided,\" the researchers conclude.\"Clinicians should inquire about a history of placenta ingestion in cases of late-onset GBS infection and educate mothers interested in placenta encapsulation about the potential risks.\"Until further research is conducted and more stringent standards for processing placenta are put into place, this is a practice that should probably be avoided",
        "b": "Title: Study Finds Encapsulated Placenta Not Superior to Beef Placebo in Improving Postpartum Iron Status\n\nA recent pilot study conducted by researchers has shed light on the efficacy of encapsulated placenta as a source of dietary iron for postpartum women. The study, published in a scientific journal, compared the effects of ingested encapsulated placenta versus a beef placebo on maternal postpartum iron status.\n\nThe randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study involved 23 healthy human participants experiencing a normal pregnancy. Maternal iron status was assessed through measurements of hemoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin levels at various time points during and after pregnancy. Iron concentrations in the encapsulated placenta and beef placebo were compared using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\n\nThe results of the study revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in maternal iron status between women who consumed the encapsulated placenta and those who took the beef placebo. Despite the encapsulated placenta having higher iron concentrations compared to the beef placebo, it only provided 24% of the recommended daily allowance for iron among lactating women based on the study's maximum daily intake.\n\nThe findings suggest that encapsulated placenta supplementation does not significantly improve or impair postpartum maternal iron status for women consuming the recommended dietary iron during pregnancy and lactation, compared to a beef placebo. This is particularly important for women who are iron deficient postpartum and rely on encapsulated placenta as their sole source of supplemental dietary iron, as it may not provide adequate iron in cases of deficiency.\n\nThe study highlights the need for further research on the efficacy of placenta encapsulation as a dietary iron source and its impact on postpartum maternal health. Understanding the limitations of encapsulated placenta supplementation can help healthcare providers make informed recommendations to women regarding their postpartum nutrition and iron intake.\n\nOverall, the study contributes valuable insights into the debate surrounding the practice of maternal placentophagy and its potential benefits for postpartum women. Further research is warranted to explore alternative sources of iron supplementation for women at risk of iron deficiency during the postpartum period.",

        "a": "We know that the Moon plays a significant role in our lives on Earth, from lighting up the night sky to setting the times of the ocean's tides. But a new study suggests that our favourite cratered satellite also influences something else on our planet: the chances of rainfall.\nScientists from the University of Washington looked at 15 years' worth of data supplied by NASA and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite owned by Japan's space agency. They found that when the Moon is high in the sky, it creates 'bulges' in Earth's atmosphere that cause a slight change in precipitation levels. The higher air pressure created by each oscillation leads to an increase in temperature, and because warmer air can hold more moisture, that means less chance of rain.\"As far as I know, this is the first study to convincingly connect the tidal force of the Moon with rainfall,\" said one of the researchers, Tsubasa Kohyama. \"When the Moon is overhead or underfoot, the air pressure is higher\u2026 it's like the container becomes larger at higher pressure.\"However, \"No one should carry an umbrella just because the Moon is rising,\" he adds.\n\nThe variations in rainfall levels are so slight as to be almost imperceptible to most of us.Where the researchers' findings are going to be practically useful is in climate change modelling and long-term weather forecasts, where these differences can add up. In the future, the researchers also want to investigate whether heavy downpours and other extreme weather types are influenced by the lunar cycle.The new report builds on earlier research carried out by Kohyama and his colleague John Wallace, published in 2014. This paper looked at the way in which the phases of the Moon influenced air pressure down on Earth - a phenomenon scientists have hypothesised about since the mid-19th century. The latest study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, links those same variations with rainfall.The change caused by the Moon is about 1 percent of the total variation in rainfall, according to the researchers, so you probably won't see weather forecasters adjusting their maps with lunar data anytime soon. Statistically speaking, the variation caused by lunar activity works out as 0.78 micrometres (1 micrometre is 0.001 millimetres) per hour. The findings are more likely to be used in computer models of how weather patterns might evolve in the future",
        "b": "Title: Study Finds Lunar Tides Influence Precipitation Rates Through Changes in Relative Humidity\n\nA recent study published in a scientific journal has shed light on the influence of lunar tides on precipitation rates through changes in relative humidity. The research, conducted using a 15-year global precipitation dataset from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, detected a statistically significant signature of the lunar gravitational semidiurnal tide (L2) in precipitation rates.\n\nClassical tidal theory predicts that the L2 tide should induce perturbations in relative humidity. The study found that adiabatic expansion in divergent flow ahead of the L2 pressure minimum cools the air, reducing its saturation vapor pressure. This process increases the rate of condensation in saturated air parcels and causes the relative humidity of unsaturated parcels to rise.\n\nThe researchers observed that precipitation rates varied out of phase with pressure, increasing at a rate of about 10% per 1% increase in relative humidity. These findings support the idea that the L2 tide modulates precipitation mainly by perturbing relative humidity.\n\nFurthermore, the study also analyzed the influence of the solar semidiurnal (S2) tide on precipitation rates and found similar results to those of the L2 tide. This suggests that planetary-scale changes in relative humidity play a crucial role in determining precipitation rates on a global scale.\n\nThe discovery of the link between lunar tides and precipitation rates through changes in relative humidity provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving variations in global precipitation patterns. Understanding how natural phenomena such as tidal forces impact weather patterns can improve our ability to predict and adapt to changes in precipitation, ultimately contributing to better climate modeling and forecasting.",

        "a": "Title: New Tools Developed to Assess Migraine Impact and Improve Patient Care\n\nMigraine is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing unpredictable and varying levels of pain, duration, and severity. Despite its prevalence, migraine is often under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and under-treated in primary care settings. However, recent research has proposed a novel approach to enhance migraine care by incorporating assessments of migraine impact into management strategies.\n\nA study published in a scientific journal has revealed that measuring headache-related disability, along with pain intensity, headache frequency, tiredness, mood changes, and cognition, can provide valuable insights into the impact of migraine on individuals' lives and society as a whole. As a result of this research, two simple and concise impact assessment tools have been developed: the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire and the Headache Impact Test (HIT).\n\nBoth the MIDAS Questionnaire and HIT have been scientifically validated as effective measures of migraine severity. These tools have the potential to enhance communication between patients and healthcare providers, evaluate migraine severity, and serve as outcome measures to monitor the effectiveness of treatment strategies. While each tool offers unique advantages, the HIT tool stands out for its accessibility, being available online and in paper form, with a broader coverage of headache spectrum compared to MIDAS.\n\nThe incorporation of impact assessment tools in migraine management guidelines is gaining momentum, aiming to create personalized treatment plans for each patient based on individual assessments. While the optimal impact tool for primary care settings is yet to be definitively recommended, it is essential that the chosen tool is user-friendly for general practitioners, pharmacists, nurses, patients, and researchers alike.\n\nIn conclusion, the development and utilization of impact assessment tools such as MIDAS and HIT represent a significant step forward in improving the management of migraine in primary care settings. By incorporating these tools into clinical practice, healthcare providers can better understand the impact of migraine on patients' lives, tailor treatment plans accordingly, and ultimately enhance the quality of care provided to individuals suffering from this debilitating condition.",
        "b": "Have you ever experienced a migraine? If so, perhaps you recognise this:\"It feels as if there is hammering and pounding in the head. Sound or talking is unbearable, as is light or glare. The pain arises from hot, choleric fumes, together with windiness. And so one feels piercing, burning and ringing.\"\nSuch a precise explanation of the pain and disorientation experienced during a migraine might have been written yesterday.In fact, it comes from an encyclopedia, compiled by the Franciscan monk Bartholomaeus Anglicus (Bartholomew the Englishman), in the 13th century.There aren't many ailments that have maintained so clear a course over so many centuries. And what's more, looking at the history of migraines reveals that the ailment was actually taken more seriously in the past, something we can learn a lot from today.Hemicrania decipheredWe can pinpoint the beginning of the history of migraine as a named disorder to Galen (c. 129 to c. 216/17 CE), the most famous philosopher and physician in the Roman Empire.Galen set migraine, or hemicrania as he termed it, apart from other types of headache: as a painful disorder affecting only half the head, caused by the ascent of vapours from the stomach that were excessive, too hot, or too cold.\nThe 12th-century text of Causae et Curae, which scholars generally accept as the work of the the celebrated German abbess Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), gave a compelling explanation of why migraine seized only half the brain at a time.This was a bodily force so powerful, that if it seized the whole head, the pain would be unendurable.Although Galen's writings were lost with the fall of the Roman Empire, Galen's term, hemicrania, persisted, being adapted and adopted into various languages over the centuries.For example, in Middle English, we find emigranea and in medieval Wales the term migran. William Dunbar, writing in Middle Scots, used the term magryme in his poem describing the physical pain of migraine as being like an arrow piercing his brow, a pain so bad that he couldn't look at the light.\nDunbar also captured the migraine aftermath, the \"postdrome\" that came with the new morning, when he sat down to write but was unable to find any words. His head \"dulled in dullness\", his body was unrefreshed, his spirit asleep.Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, a wealth of remedies in manuscript and printed recipe collections suggest a sophisticated general knowledge about this disorder.For example, Jane Jackson's recipe book, dating from 1642, gives six separate recipes for \"Migrim in the Head\", requiring various amounts of effort to produce.The simpler remedies could be made in a few minutes from common garden ingredients (mix houseleek and earthworms with flour, spread it on a cloth and bind to the forehead), but the most complex concoction required equipment, planning and financial outlay to produce a medicine that would last 20 years.\nAs well as taking migraine seriously, Jackson's recipe book suggests that people of the 17th century appreciated that migraine could occur on a spectrum, from the occasional acute attack to a chronic illness that could last for several days.Losing legitimacyThese historical descriptions of migraine reveal that we have lost something.In all of the sources from the medieval and early modern period that I have come across during the five years I have spent tracing the history of migraine, one thing is clear: these people took migraine seriously.This is important. Migraine is now accepted as a 'real' disorder which affects around one in seven people, two-thirds of whom are women, and is recognised by the WHO as the sixth highest cause worldwide of years lost due to disability (YLD).But despite this, it (along with other headache disorders) is nevertheless chronically under-funded, its sufferers often ignored, dismissed, or blamed, and their ailments under-diagnosed and under-treated.\nIn her recent book Not Tonight, the sociologist Joanna Kempner has described this situation as migraine's \"legitimacy deficit\".So what has happened?Historical sources suggest that the question we need to ask is not how we can begin to give migraine the legitimacy it needs, but when and why we stopped taking it seriously in the first place.'La migraine', 1823.Over the course of the 18th century, something changed, as migraine became the stuff of ridicule.In May 1782, for instance, a flamboyant character graced the King's Theatre Masquerade in London, and introduced himself to the gathering as \"Le Sieur Francois de Migraine, Docteur en Medicine\"",

It can cause a whole lot of problems, from insecurity and low self-esteem through to fear of abandonment and rage.It can also reinforce romantic relationships, with people who self-report feelings of romantic jealousy also reporting, in general, higher relationship quality.We aren't entirely sure why it happens, although there are theories that it has to do with mating and resources.If we can learn more about the neurobiology of how primates respond to seeing their mates with potential rivals, though, perhaps that will give us a starting point to figure out how it works in humans.\"Understanding the neurobiology and evolution of emotions can help us understand our own emotions and their consequences,\" said lead researcher Karen Bales from the University of California.\n\"Jealousy is especially interesting given its role in romantic relationships - and also in domestic violence.\"A lot of the research into monogamy has been performed on prairie voles, but for a brain a little closer to human, Bales's team turned to coppery titi monkeys, a monogamous primate from South America. In response to romantic rivals, male titi monkeys respond with aggression, sometimes even physically holding their mates back, Bales said.The eight male monkeys were injected with fluorodeoxyglucose, a glucose molecule that fluoresces under PET-MRI.These monkeys were then subjected to two different conditions: having to watch their female mate interact with a stranger male for 30 minutes; and having to watch a stranger female interact with a stranger male for 30 minutes.When they watched their mates interact with stranger males, the monkeys showed increased activity in two regions of the brain: the cingulate cortex, which is associated with social pain in humans; and the lateral septum, which has previously identified as important for pair bonding, both in monkeys and vole",

In such species, males face the risk of lowered paternity probability and investment in rival gametes if their mates engage in sexual contact with other males. On the other hand, females do not risk lowered maternity probability through partner infidelity but face the potential diversion of their mates' commitment and resources to rival females.\n\nIn the first study, men and women were asked to choose which event would upset them more - a partner's sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity. The results showed significant differences in responses between the sexes, indicating distinct triggers for jealousy in men and women.\n\nThe second study involved recording physiological responses, such as heart rate, electrodermal response, and corrugator supercilii contraction, while subjects imagined scenarios of both sexual and emotional infidelity by their partners. The findings revealed distinct patterns of physiological arousal in men and women, further supporting the hypothesis of sex-specific jealousy responses.\n\nLastly, the third study examined the effect of being in a committed sexual relationship on the activation of jealousy. The results demonstrated significant sex differences in jealousy activation, reinforcing the idea that jealousy may have evolved as a mechanism to address the unique adaptive challenges faced by each sex in relationships.\n\nOverall, the research provides valuable insights into the evolutionary underpinnings of jealousy in human relationships, highlighting the importance of considering biological and evolutionary factors in understanding complex emotions and behaviors in interpersonal dynamics.

When comparing themselves to just one other person, men thought they were smarter 61 percent of the time, while women thought they were smarter only 33 percent of the time.These differences were observed by the researchers even when they controlled for prior academic ability, which has been found to impact academic self-confidence.It's not clear exactly why men tend to overestimate their scientific abilities, while women tend to judge their intelligence much more harshly, but there are a few theories.\n\"Really bright girls often don't feel like they know something unless they very much understand it, whereas boys are more comfortable saying they understand something without having an actual deeper understanding,\" Ilana Seidel Horn, a professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University, told NBC.The problem may also be rooted in the way science is taught in the classroom. For instance, studies have shown that greater self-confidence leads to greater participation, which in turn leads to greater learning and motivation.In a self-fulfilling cycle, lower self-confidence may be holding women back from speaking up or taking leadership roles in science class.\"More and more of these studies are painting similar pictures,\" said co-author Sara Brownell.\"Females are not participating as much in science class.

The researchers suggest that different modes of engagement trigger specific knowledge-change processes that support this hypothesis.\n\nTo validate the ICAP framework, the researchers conducted laboratory and classroom studies focusing on three specific engagement activities: note-taking, concept mapping, and self-explaining. The results provided empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis and shed light on the importance of various engagement activities in enhancing learning outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the study addresses the limitations and caveats of the ICAP hypothesis, emphasizing the need for further research to explore its full potential. The framework also offers a valuable tool for explaining discrepancies in findings, selecting appropriate control conditions, and evaluating students' performance.\n\nComparing ICAP to existing learning theories, the researchers highlight its unique contribution to understanding cognitive engagement and its potential to revolutionize teaching practices. By identifying and categorizing engagement behaviors, educators can tailor their instructional strategies to promote deeper learning and enhance student outcomes.\n\nOverall, the ICAP framework represents a significant advancement in the field of educational psychology, offering a comprehensive model for understanding the complex relationship between cognitive engagement and learning.

Oxygen would have played a big part in that, and especially the Great Oxygenation Event that scientists reckon got underway around 2.45 billion years ago.While increased oxygen levels would've killed off some microbes that evolved without oxygen, others would have been allowed to develop and flourish, marking the transition from the sparsely inhabitated landscape of Earth's middle age to the lush world we're familiar with toda",

The mats also exhibited a fossil biota characteristic of cyanobacterial and rhodophyte morphotypes, suggesting the presence of oxygenic phototrophs in the ancient microbial communities.\n\nOn the other hand, stromatolites from the Jhamarkotra Formation displayed cone-like structures with mineralized bubbles enmeshed within filamentous mat fabrics. The construction of these tufts was attributed to filamentous bacteria gliding within microbial mats, with the fossilized bubbles serving as a proxy for oxygenic phototrophy, indicating cyanobacterial activity in the Aravalli mounds.\n\nThe researchers proposed that the activity of oxygenic phototrophs, such as cyanobacteria, played a significant role in the formation of apatite-rich stromatolites in both the Vindhyan and Aravalli formations. By concentrating phosphate and creating redox gradients within mat pore spaces, photosynthetic organisms likely promoted apatite precipitation. The alternating apatite-carbonate lamina observed in the stromatolites may have resulted from local variations in pH and oxygen levels driven by photosynthesis and respiration processes within the mats.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the ecology of ancient phosphatic stromatolites and highlights the importance of oxygen-producing biotas in the formation of Paleoproterozoic shallow-basin phosphorites. The findings underscore the complex interactions between early microbial communities and their environment, shedding light on the processes that shaped Earth's early biosphere. Further research into ancient stromatolites and their microbial inhabitants promises to unveil more secrets of our planet's distant past.",

The southern pig-tailed macaque and the grey mouse lemur, for example, snooze for as many as 14 to 17 hours a day. What's more, some lemurs and monkeys enter the\n\nRapid Eye Movement\n\n(REM) mode of sleep - which is of\n\nbetter quality than light dozing -\n\nfor just 5 percent of the total time they're asleep, compared to around 25 percent for humans.For the purposes of the study, the researchers from Duke University looked at data collected on hundreds of mammals across 21 different species of primates. The data was then analysed to look for slumber patterns in each species.It turns out human beings are top of the tree in terms of both the brevity and the efficiency of sleep - we've somehow evolved to get better quality shut-eye in a shorter span of time. Chimpanzees, meanwhile - our closest animal relatives - sleep for an average of 11.5 hours a night.Study co-author David Samson previously logged nearly 2,000 hours watching orangutans in REM and non-REM sleep as part of his dissertation research. He suggests that the shift in humans could have been caused by a switch from building beds in the trees to sleeping on the ground, and then to the comfortable beds we know today.\nA more relaxed and warm sleep by the campfire may have originally helped us get more sustenance from a shorter period of slumber, they suggest.The researchers also hypothesise that, as a species, we gradually cut down our sleeping hours to spend more time on more interesting pursuits: specifically, learning new skills and forging social bonds. Today, of course, it's Netflix binges and the glare of smartphones that are cutting down on our time in bed - but the research indicates the shift started happening a long time ago.They also looked at a separate study of three remote hunter-gatherer societies in Tanzania, Namibia, and Bolivia, and found that they sleep for slightly longer than the rest of us.

Despite our advanced mental and behavioral capacities, the evolution of human sleep has remained a mystery until now.\n\nThe study introduces the sleep intensity hypothesis, proposing that early humans experienced selective pressure to fulfill their sleep needs in the shortest time possible. This unique adaptation may have been driven by various factors, including increased predation risk in terrestrial environments, threats from intergroup conflict, and the benefits of enhanced social interaction.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the efficiency of human sleep may have enabled longer periods of wakefulness for acquiring and transmitting new skills and knowledge. Additionally, the deeper sleep observed in early humans could have played a crucial role in the consolidation of these skills, ultimately leading to enhanced cognitive abilities.\n\nThe findings of this study challenge the prevailing notion that human sleep patterns align with those of other mammals. Instead, the researchers suggest that human sleep is more specialized and optimized for cognitive performance and survival in complex social environments.\n\nThis research opens up new avenues for exploring the evolutionary origins of human sleep and its impact on cognitive development.

        "a": "The most poisonous animal in the world is difficult to quantify, but one of the most deadly is, without question, the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), native to Colombia. But how does it avoid killing itself with its toxins?\nThey look adorable, but within their skin glands, they store an alkaloid toxin called batrachotoxin. Enough of it, on average, to kill 10 human beings \u2014 if the poison enters your bloodstream, you'll likely be dead in under 10 minutes.There's only one known species that is resistant to it (a snake), and there is no known antidote.The frogs don't create the toxin themselves. When removed from their natural environment and bred in captivity, they are completely harmless, which has led to the accepted theory that, like poisonous puffer fish, the frogs synthesise the toxin from their diet.So why don't they die of it themselves? To figure it out, researchers from the State University of New York\n\n(SUNY) turned to rats.Batrachotoxin works by irreversibly opening the sodium channels of nerve cells, which permanently blocks the transmission of nerve signals to the muscles, while preventing the muscles from being able to relax. The heart is particularly susceptible, and the end result is cardiac failure.\nPuffer fish tetrodotoxin also works on the sodium channel, although the mechanism is slightly different. But they have a single amino acid mutation that modifies their sodium channels so that they are immune to their own poison.The researchers, Sho-Ya Wang and Ging Kuo Wang, looked to amino acids for the frogs' immunity.Using rat muscle, they tested five naturally occurring amino acid substitutions that had been found within P. terribilis muscle. When all five of the rat amino acids were replaced with the frog mutations, the rat muscle was completely resistant to batrachotoxin.The next step was to try the substitutions one by one. All but one still showed a high sensitivity to the toxin. The one substitution that remained resistant is called N1584T. For this mutation, the amino acid asparagine is replaced with the amino acid threonin",
        "b": "Title: New Insights into the Mechanism of Batrachotoxin Blockade of Sodium Channels Revealed in Cardiac Cells\n\nIn a recent study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have uncovered new details about how batrachotoxin (BTX) affects the function of voltage-gated sodium channels in cardiac cells. The study sheds light on the mechanism by which BTX, a potent neurotoxin found in certain frog species, disrupts the flow of sodium ions through these channels.\n\nVoltage-gated sodium channels play a crucial role in the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cells, including cardiac cells. BTX is known to bind to these channels, causing them to remain open for longer periods and reducing their ability to conduct ions. However, the precise way in which sodium ions navigate through the BTX-bound pathway has remained unclear until now.\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that sodium ions pass through a narrow space between BTX and a specific residue, N927, located in a specific region of the sodium channel known as D2S6. To test this hypothesis, the team conducted experiments using cardiac sodium channels (hNav1.5) with a mutation at residue N927.\n\nTheir findings revealed that BTX at a concentration of 5 uM led to a significant blockage of sodium currents in the mutated channels, with approximately 70% inhibition observed after a series of repetitive electrical pulses. Importantly, this blockage was found to be irreversible under the experimental conditions, indicating a strong and persistent effect of BTX on sodium channel function.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers observed that the extent of blockage induced by BTX was dependent on the duration of the electrical pulses, with longer pulses resulting in greater inhibition of sodium currents. Interestingly, only specific mutations at residue N927, such as N927K and N927R, were highly sensitive to the blocking effects of BTX, highlighting the critical role of this residue in ion permeation through the BTX-bound pathway.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the blockade of sodium channels by BTX, suggesting that the toxin binds within the inner cavity of the channel and interferes with the passage of sodium ions by partially obstructing the permeation pathway. The identification of residue N927 as a key player in this process offers new opportunities for understanding and potentially modulating the effects of BTX on sodium channel function in cardiac cells.\n\nThese findings not only enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between toxins and ion channels but also have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting sodium channel dysfunction in various pathological conditions. Further research in this area could lead to the discovery of new drugs that selectively modulate sodium channel activity, offering potential benefits for patients with cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiovascular disorders.",

The study, led by researchers from four forensic settings in the Netherlands, aimed to compare the criminal behavior of women with and without psychopathy.\n\nThe research, which involved 221 female forensic psychiatric patients admitted between 1984 and 2012, utilized an extensive questionnaire that included demographic, criminal, and psychiatric variables. The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, various risk assessment tools, and a taxonomy of motivations were also employed in the study.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was that women with psychopathy tended to be younger at the time of their first conviction compared to women without psychopathy. Additionally, women with psychopathy exhibited more criminal versatility in their offense histories, indicating a broader range of criminal behaviors.\n\nIn terms of the index offense, women with psychopathy were less likely to commit a fatal offense, more likely to have stranger victims, and were more prone to offenses motivated by power, dominance, or personal gain. This motivation typology, known as the \"Bad motivation typology,\" was found to be more prevalent among women with psychopathy.\n\nInterestingly, the study did not find significant differences between women with and without psychopathy in terms of the type of weapon used during the index offense. This suggests that the choice of weapon may not be a distinguishing factor in the criminal behavior of women with psychopathy.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant for the understanding and assessment of psychopathy in women. By identifying specific patterns of criminal behavior associated with psychopathy in women, clinicians and researchers can develop more targeted interventions and risk assessment strategies.\n\nThe study highlights the need for further research into psychopathy in women, as well as the importance of considering gender-specific factors in the assessment and treatment of individuals with psychopathic traits.

        "b": "Hear the word psychopath and most of us think of violent, dominant men. There are lots of male psychopathic monsters from movies to illustrate this point. Think Alex in A Clockwork Orange, or Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.\nBut we do have some female examples: Annie Wilkes in Misery, and who could forget Alex Forrest's bunny-boiling character in Fatal Attraction? These frightening fictional femme fatales stay with us \u2013 I've heard the term \"bunny boiler\" used to signify a woman behaving irrationally and violently \u2013 but they are unusual. We largely expect psychopaths to be men.Research indicates there are likely to be fewer female psychopaths than male. This may well be true. However, a compounding factor leading to the underestimation of the true occurrence rate of psychopathy in women could be behavioural differences that cause them to slip under society's radar.This is important to acknowledge as female psychopaths can be just as dangerous as their male counterparts.What is psychopathy?Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterised by a number of abnormal behavioural traits and emotional responses. These include lack of empathy, guilt or remorse, and being manipulative and deceitful. People with psychopathy are often irresponsible and have a disregard for laws or social conventions.\nPsychopaths often get away with these behaviours because they can be superficially quite charming. They are true observers of human behaviour, often being able to mimic love, fear, remorse and other emotions well enough to go undetected.Current thinking suggests psychopaths' behaviour patterns result from variations in the structure of their brains at birth. A recent study from Harvard University indicated their brains are wired in a way that can lead to violent or dangerous actions.Researchers used MRI scans to determine if activity and connections between areas of the brain associated with impulsivity and assessing the value of choices differed between those who scored highly for psychopathy and those who didn't.The scans showed psychopaths make more short-sighted, impulsive decisions based on short-term gain, when compared to non-psychopaths, and that it is the structure of their brains that leads them to make these kinds of poor decisions.\nAdd this to their lack of empathy and it means if violence or dangerous behaviour will help a psychopath achieve a short-term goal, that is the path they will take. There is also evidence genetics are at least partly responsible for the development of psychopathic traits. In essence, psychopaths are born, not made.Case studiesCertain case studies show how women psychopaths present in the real world. \"Amy\" is a 20-year-old female serving a life sentence for murder.

Now, thanks to new calculations, that hypothesis is getting a whole lot more attention.\nA new study suggests that scientists have overlooked one important clue in their calculations: that this hypothetical dark matter disc could make room for itself\n\nwithin our galaxy. If this disc can pinch in other types of matter \u2013 stars, gas, and dust \u2013 like the researchers suggest, then a dark matter disc begins to look more likely.Physicist Lisa Randall of Harvard University first proposed her version of the dark disc theory in 2013.\n\nDutch astronomer Jan Oort first floated the idea in 1932, after observing the irregular movement of the stars in our galaxy, and Randall has brought it out of obscurity. But, as Natalie Wolchover reports for\n\nWired, it's a controversial idea that has more detractors than supporters.Randall's new paper, written with Harvard graduate student Eric Kramer, is online at pre-press site, arXiv.org and has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.The pair explains that the total visible mass of the Milky Way is typically estimated by extrapolating outwards from the density of its midplane \u2013 the central line passing through the galaxy.\n\nIf a dark disc exists and can pinch matter towards it \u2013 at the midplane \u2013 then our previous calculations are inaccurate.\nThat means the presence of a disc becomes possible, and perhaps even slightly probable, depending on the type of analysis used, they argue.\n\nThe fact that no one was looking for a disc that could interfere with matter in this way is why a lot of previous studies haven't seen evidence for it, Kramer told Wolchover.Other experts who've run the numbers say there's not enough room for error to leave the chance of a dark matter disc existing. \"It's more strongly constrained than Lisa Randall pretends,\" astrophysicist Jo Bovy of the University of Toronto in Canada, told her.Bovy, who wasn't involved in the new research, but has carried out his own measurements, thinks that even with a pinching effect in place, a disc could only account for 2 percent of the dark matter estimated to exist in the galaxy. That leaves a lot of unexplained dark matter.Thanks to the Gaia space observatory, we might soon know one way or the other: it's currently carrying out a new inventory of the Milky Way, which will give us a more accurate account of the position and velocity of 1 billion star",

The study, which builds upon the work of Holmberg & Flynn (2000), incorporates updated models of the Milky Way's interstellar gas radial velocities, an updated reddening map, and a meticulous statistical analysis to constrain the surface density and scale height of the dark disk.\n\nResearchers paid close attention to the self-consistency of the model, considering the gravitational impact of the dark disk on other disk components and the net velocity of tracer stars. The data set revealed a non-zero bulk velocity in the vertical direction and a displacement from the expected location at the Galactic midplane. Failure to account for these features could bias the bound toward a lower dark disk mass.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers employed two different analysis methods. The traditional method involved subtracting the mean velocity and displacement from the tracers' phase space distributions, while the second method utilized a non-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive constraints on the dark disk parameters for an oscillating tracer distribution.\n\nThe results showed that despite updates in the mass model and reddening map, the traditional method's outcomes remained consistent with those of HF2000. However, the non-equilibrium technique allowed for a surface density as high as 14M\u2299pc\u22122, indicating weaker constraints. Additionally, the study found that the bound on surface density weakened for larger scale heights.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for future analyses of Gaia data, emphasizing the importance of verifying whether tracer populations are in equilibrium. By refining our understanding of the dark disk component of the Milky Way, researchers can gain valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of our galaxy.\n\nThis study represents a crucial step forward in unraveling the mysteries of the dark disk and deepening our understanding of the complex interplay of components within the Milky Way.",

It's complicated, but some 30 years of psychological research suggest there might just be a few methods that are worth a try.Use a person's body against themGot a date coming up? Maybe you should consider taking them to see a horror movie. \"Misattribution of arousal\" is a popular theory in social psychology that suggests people sometimes mislabel feelings from their body.For example, you experience an elevated heart rate when you are anxious, but also when you are excited.Psychologists have therefore been experimenting on whether it is possible to use this idea to manipulate individuals into thinking they are experiencing particular emotions, such as believing they are attracted when they're actually scared This is because removing the \"you\" removes the accusatory element.Another linguistic trick is to use nouns rather than verbs when discussing an outcome you want to happen.In one study people were asked \"how important is it to you to be a voter in tomorrow's election?\" versus \"how important is it to you to vote in tomorrow's election?\" When people were asked about \"being a voter\", this primed their self-identity as a person who votes.The people who were asked about being a \"voter\" were 11 percent more likely to vote in a state election the next day, compared to those who were asked about \"voting\".There are also various other body and language tricks you can employ that have been shown to increase people's liking or trust in you, such as subtly mimicking people's body posture, looking people in the eye more frequently and saying their name more often Use rewards and punishments variablyDoes your loved one need some \"behaviour shaping\"? Maybe a bit more hanging up the bathmat, and a bit less using your toothbrush?We all know that you can increase the likelihood that someone will do something by rewarding it, and decrease it through punishment.But, operant conditioning psychology shows that for prolonged manipulation, it is better not to reward or punish every instance of the behaviour.So if you want someone to keep doing something (or to stop doing something), you can simply alter the schedule by which you dole out rewards or punishments to maximise their compliance.A variable reinforcement schedule like this works by the slightly creepy \"will they, won't they\" principle \u2013 where the uncertainty makes people learn faster and maintain a behaviour longer once the reward or punishment is removed.In the same way, not knowing how many more plays you need before you win is part of what makes gambling and the lottery so addictive.Ask for something you don't wantA large body of popular research suggests that if you are trying to get something, you may help your case by also asking for something you don't want.The \"foot-in-the-door method\" refers to the fact that, once a person has agreed to a very small request, they are more likely to agree to another, much larger request \u2013 significantly more so than if they were only posed with the large request.It was first suggested this must occur because people use their own behaviour as a cue to their internal attitudes.Since they were not pressured externally into agreeing, the person unconsciously infers their acquiescence is due to a positive attitude towards the asker or the issue.The effect seems to hold even when the second request is a completely different type, or when made by a different person.Given this, it was thought that perhaps the first \"yes\" changes the individual's own disposition towards saying yes to things in general (\"I am clearly such a yes man\").On the flip side, if you ask for something outrageously large that a person would never agree to, you actually raise your chances of agreement to a second smaller request.This may also be a form of reciprocity effect: the person being asked is compelled to make a compromise, in response to the asker making a concession.In sum, social psychology may not change your life \u2026 but it may just help you get the last biscuit.Harriet Dempsey-Jones, Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Neurosciences, University of Oxford.This article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

The findings offer a rare glimpse into the spiritual world of the past, providing a richer understanding of the cultural heritage of the Ashkelon region.\n\nAs further research is conducted on the tomb complex and its burial practices, archaeologists hope to unravel more mysteries surrounding the ancient funeral kits and their role in shaping the funerary customs of the Middle and Late Bronze Age civilizations. The study serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of these ancient societies and the importance of preserving and studying their archaeological remains for future generations.",

By analyzing stone tools recovered from central places of the Tongan state, researchers were able to assess the extent of maritime interaction in the Central Pacific.\n\nA key finding of the study was that a high proportion (66%) of the stone tools analyzed were identified as long-distance imports from regions such as Fiji, Samoa, and the Society Islands. These exotic lithics served as an important source of political capital for Tongan elites, highlighting the significance of long-distance trade in the development and consolidation of the Tongan polity.\n\nThe research also revealed that the Tongan state had established networks focused on regions like Samoa and Fiji, with some artifacts sourced as far as the Society Islands, 2,500 km away from Tongatapu. This evidence supports the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were highly valued by Tongan elites and played a crucial role in enhancing their political power and influence.\n\nFurthermore, the study demonstrated that the intensification of interarchipelago connections coincided with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast, stone tools found in Samoa were predominantly from local sources, indicating the distinctiveness of Tonga's long-distance trade networks in the region.\n\nThe researchers employed network analysis techniques to map the distribution of lithics entering the Tongan state and the presence of Samoan adzes in the Pacific, revealing the centralized nature of the Tongan polity and the existence of specialized lithic workshops in Samoa. These specialized sites served as important centers for long-distance interaction, facilitating the exchange of information, people, and materials across prehistoric Oceania.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the maritime state of Tonga and its role in shaping long-distance trade networks and political dynamics in the prehistoric Pacific. By unraveling the complexities of ancient maritime interactions, researchers have deepened our understanding of the interconnectedness of societies in Oceania and the significance of trade in the development of early states.",

        "a": "In an experiment that could nearly double the rate of solar energy conversion from 32 to 60 percent, scientists in Switzerland have used the super-material graphene to convert a single photon into many electrons to produce an electric current.\nThe team, from the Swiss \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), demonstrates how graphene could join cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide/sulphide, and various silicon structures as one of the few known photovoltaic materials - high-efficiency, solar energy-producing materials.\n\nThey achieved this by placing a sample of graphene - a thin layer of pure carbon that's around 100 times stronger than steel and a very efficient heat and electricity conductor - into an ultra-high vacuum chamber. The graphene they used was 'doped', which means electrons were added or subtracted chemically before the experiment.\n\nThe graphene was then blasted with a super-fast pulse of laser light, which 'excites' the electrons floating around in the graphene and puts the whole material into a higher energy state than before the laser blast. In this state, says Michael Byrne at Motherboard, an excited - or 'hot' - electron might \"pop loose from its atomic home\", and when it very quickly falls back into its regular state of energy, it excites an average of two more electrons as a knock-on effect. This phenomenon can then be conducted as an electric current and used for power, and it all happens in a matter of femtoseconds, so a few quadrillionths of a second.The team observed this phenomenon for the first time by recording the energy of each electron at different points in time, over and over again, like \"a kind of stop-motion movie of the conversion process\", says Dexter Johnson at IEEE Spectrum.\n\"This indicates that a photovoltaic device using doped graphene could show significant efficiency in converting light to electricity,\" one of the team, materials scientist Marco Grioni, said in a press release.The amount of energy you need to force an electron free depends on the material you're using. If the amount of energy you need to achieve this phenomenon is too great, the material will be considered inefficient, because the leftovers will end up as wasted heat energy. But this new technique, known as carrier multiplication, uses that leftover energy to 'pop loose' more electrons so they can be harvested for power.The results have been published in Nano Letters.It's pretty exciting stuff, because graphene is even better at conducting electricity than copper. But there's one big problem - graphene isn't great at absorbing light, which is pretty crucial if you want to make solar panels and the like out of it",

The study, which utilized time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements on two doped graphene samples with varying doping levels, revealed significant differences in the dynamics of hot carriers within the Dirac cone.\n\nThe researchers focused on two graphene samples with distinct doping levels \u2013 one more strongly (n-)doped and the other less (p-)doped. The results showed that the more strongly doped graphene sample exhibited larger carrier multiplication factors (>3) and a notably faster phonon-mediated cooling of the carriers back to equilibrium compared to the less doped sample. This suggests that the doping level plays a crucial role in influencing the dynamical response of graphene to photoexcitation.\n\nThe findings of the study indicate that by carefully tuning the doping level of graphene, researchers may be able to effectively manipulate the material's response to photoexcitation. This could have significant implications for the development of graphene-based technologies, as the ability to control the ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers could lead to improved performance in various applications, such as photodetectors, solar cells, and ultrafast electronics.\n\nGraphene, a two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, has garnered significant attention in the scientific community due to its exceptional electronic properties. Understanding and controlling the behavior of hot carriers in graphene is crucial for harnessing its full potential in future technological advancements.\n\nThe researchers behind this study have provided valuable insights into the intricate interplay between doping levels and the ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers in graphene. Their work opens up new avenues for further research aimed at optimizing the performance of graphene-based devices through precise doping control.\n\nOverall, this study represents a significant step forward in the field of graphene research, offering a deeper understanding of how doping levels can influence the behavior of hot carriers in this remarkable material.

        "a": "Just weeks after Hurricane Harvey caused destruction in Texas, Irma has made landfall in Florida - and there are still almost 12 weeks left of Atlantic hurricane season. It raises the question - where are all of these storms coming from?\nResearch has shown that most of the monster storms that hit the US and Canada start out as a distinct weather pattern in the atmosphere over western Africa, specifically a spot off the coast of the African Cape Verde\n\nislands.In fact, a 2015 study published in Geophysical Research Letters\n\nshowed that by closely watching these tropical disturbances off the coast of western Africa, researchers could better predict which of them would turn into serious hurricanes a few weeks later.Google Maps\"85 percent of the most intense hurricanes affecting the US and Canada start off as disturbances in the atmosphere over western Africa,\" said lead researcher Colin Price from Tel Aviv University in Israel at the time.\n\"We found that the larger the area covered by the disturbances, the higher the chance they would develop into hurricanes only one to two weeks later.\"Interestingly, these hurricanes are directly linked to one of the driest places on Earth - the Sahara desert.The interaction between the hot dry air of the Sahara and the cooler, more humid air from the Gulf of Guinea to its South forms what's known as the African easterly jet, which blows from east to west across Africa.\n\nWithin this jet, atmospheric disturbances or bands of thunderstorm activity known as tropical waves can form. As they blow off the west coast of Africa past Cape Verde, the 2015 study showed that the amount of cloud coverage at that point can predict whether or not these tropical waves will become hurricanes a week or two later.\nHow does that happen? Tropical waves interact with the warm equatorial water of the Atlantic as they head west, triggering columns of warm moist air to rise from the ocean.That provides two of the three ingredients required for tropical storms to turn into full-blown hurricanes: moist air; Earth's rotation; and warm ocean temperatures. When the swirling winds reach speeds of 74 mph (119 km/h), the storm is classified as a Category 1 hurricane.Irma was first spotted as a tropical disturbance off the Cape Verde Islands in late August, before becoming a hurricane over the Atlantic as it made its way towards the Caribbean and US.According to Price, only 10 percent of the 60 disturbances originating in Africa every year turn into hurricanes - but the ones that do have the opportunity to gather energy as they cross the Atlantic, which makes them so powerful that they're more likely to hit the US and even Canada.\n\"Not all hurricanes tha",

Researchers have found that a significant portion of major Atlantic hurricanes originate as thunderstorm clusters in equatorial Africa, with approximately 85% of these storms having their roots in this region.\n\nThe study, conducted over a 6-year period from 2005 to 2010, analyzed Meteosat infrared cloud top temperature data to assess the areal coverage of cold cloud tops over tropical Africa. Additionally, hurricane statistics from the same period, including intensity, date of generation, location, and maximum winds, were obtained from the National Hurricane Center database.\n\nThe findings of the study revealed that the areal coverage of cold clouds, with brightness temperatures below -50\u00b0C, in tropical Africa serves as a reliable indicator of the monthly number of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) moving from the west coast of the continent. Moreover, the research highlighted that AEWs which evolve into tropical storms exhibit a significantly larger area covered by cold cloud tops compared to waves that do not develop into storms.\n\nFurthermore, on a storm-by-storm basis, the study demonstrated a positive correlation between the cold cloud coverage in West Africa and the accumulated cyclone energy of future tropical cyclones originating from these waves. The researchers found that a higher coverage of cold cloud tops in West Africa was associated with increased cyclone energy in the resulting tropical cyclones.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the early stages of tropical storm development in the Atlantic basin and could potentially aid in improving forecasting and early warning systems for hurricanes. By better understanding the relationship between African thunderstorms and the formation of tropical storms, researchers hope to enhance preparedness and response efforts for these potentially devastating weather events.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of monitoring and studying African thunderstorms as a key factor in the genesis and intensification of Atlantic hurricanes, ultimately contributing to advancements in hurricane prediction and disaster mitigation strategies.",

        "a": "When it comes to texting, the period, full stop, point \u2013 whatever you call it \u2013 has been getting a lot of attention.People have begun noticing slight changes to the way our smallest punctuation mark is deployed, from declarations that it's going out of style to claims that it's becoming angry.\nWhat they're actually noticing is written language becoming more flexible, with texting possessing its own set of stylistic norms (sometimes informally called \"textspeak\" or \"textese\").The period is merely one example of this shift, a change that has opened up new possibilities for communicating with written language. Just as we have different styles of speaking in different situations, so do we have context-dependent styles of writing.Reading between the periodsThough periods can still signal the end of a sentence in a text message, many users will omit them (especially if the message is only one sentence long). This tendency now subtly influences how we interpret them.Because text messaging is a conversation that involves a lot of back-and-forth, people add fillers as a way to mimic spoken language. We see this with the increased use of ellipses, which can invite the recipient to continue the conversation.\nThe period is the opposite of that \u2013 a definitive stop that signals, as linguistics professor Mark Liberman has explained, \"This is final, this is the end of the discussion.\"For some, this can appear angry or standoffish.Earlier this year, psychologist Danielle Gunraj tested how people perceived one-sentence text messages that used a period at the end of the sentence. Participants thought these text messages were more insincere than those that didn't have a period.But when the researchers then tested the same messages in handwritten notes, they found that the use of a period didn't influence how the messages were perceived.In a 2007 study by linguists Naomi Baron and Rich Ling, multi-sentence text messages often had punctuation to indicate where the sentences stopped, but only 29 percent of these texts had punctuation at the very end of the message. The reason, Baron and Ling explain, is that \"the act of sending a message coincides with sentence-final punctuation\".\nSituational switchesBut of all the things to feel when seeing a period at the end of a text message \u2013 why\n\ninsincerity?The answer could have something to do with a term used by linguist John J. Gumperz: \"situational code-switching\",\n\nwhich is when we change how we talk depending on where we are, who we're talking to or how we're communicating.A common example is the way we talk in a job interview versus at a bar with friends. Typically, a speaker will use much more formal language in an interview than when hanging out with peers.If you talked to your friends the same way you talked during a job interview, it would probably give a stilted, distant feeling to the conversation.Scholars originally investigated situational code-switching in spoken language because spoken language was used in both casual and formal settings. In the past, written language was almost always tinged with a level of formality because it was associated with permanence in books and written documents.\nHowever, now that text messaging and social media have given their users an outlet for casual written language, differences between writing styles can be seen.The use of the period is one example of situational code-switching: When using one in a text message, it's perceived as overly formal. So when you end your text with a period, it can come across as insincere or awkward, just like using formal spoken language in a casual setting like a bar.A different form of sincerityAnother example of language change in casual written forms is the repetition of letters. Communication scholar Erika Darics has observed that the repetition of letters or punctuation marks adds intensity to messages (\"stopppp!!!\"). She writes that this creates \"a display of informality through using a relaxed writing style\".\nLinguist Deborah Tannen described a similar phenomenon, noting that repeated exclamation points in a message can convey a sincere tone, like in the following text message:\nJACKIE I AM SO SO SO SORRY! I thought you were behind us in the cab and then I saw you weren't!!!!! I feel soooooooo bad! Catch another cab and ill pay for it for youuuuu\nNote that this message does not contain a message-final period, since that may convey insincerity that would contradict the apology being presented. Instead, the sender uses the non-standard long vowels in \"soooooooo\"\n\nand \"youuuuu\"\n\nas well as five exclamation points at the end of one sentence.Compare this to a standardised version of the text message:\nJackie, I am so sorry. I thought you were behind us in the cab and then I saw you weren't. I feel so bad! Catch another cab and I'll pay for it for you.\nThis more formal version, according to the arguments made by Tannen and Darics, reads more like a work email sent to a colleague than one to a friend sincerely and fervently apologising for a transportation mishap.\nIt's a bit counterintuitive, but using formal language may undermine the sincerity of the apology; in order to convey the 'right' message, it's important to know the proper protocols. This may explain why some people's text messages seem stilted or awkward: they're used to writing with a formal style that doesn't translate to the casual medium.Will texting erode our writing skills?In the media, there's been a fair amount of debate about whether texting \u2013 or using overly casual language \u2013 can 'ruin' someone's writing ability. (Examples include the LA Times, the BBC, and The Daily Mail, to name a few.)However, past research into situational code-switching in spoken language has shown that a person's ability to code-switch can signal social competency, can affirm one's sense of identity or membership\n\nin a community and may be an indicator of high intellectual ability in children",

Bubbles then travel through the shaft and excite nerve endings at the base of the tooth near the head, sending signals to the brain about the narwhal's surroundings.This sensitivity suggests that the narwhal tusk isn't something to be used haphazardly - you'll notice in the footage above that those hunting taps are extremely gentle.\nIt also reveals the cost of narwhal territorial battles (as seen in the image at the top of the page), which involve bashing their most sensitive appendages against each other.We should note that the behaviour in the drone footage has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal at this stage, so any interpretations of what we're seeing will have to be independently verified.\n\nBut this is the first time we've ever seen the mysterious narwhal tusk being used for hunting, which could be the final piece of the puzzle for this bizarre oddity of evolution",

Long shrouded in mystery, the narwhal's iconic tusk is now believed to serve as a sensory organ, capable of detecting external stimuli and transmitting information to the brain.\n\nThe study delves into the intricate sensory pathway of the narwhal tusk, shedding light on how ocean water enters through cementum channels to reach a network of patent dentinal tubules. These tubules extend from the dentinocementum junction to the inner pulpal wall, where circumpulpal sensory structures signal pulpal nerves that terminate near the base of the tusk. The sensory information is then transmitted to the brain via the maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve.\n\nNew evidence presented in the study suggests that the patent dentinal tubules communicate with open channels through a porous cementum, allowing for direct interaction with the ocean environment. Immunohistochemical detection of neuronal markers in the pulp and gene expression of pulpal sensory nerve tissue further support the tusk's sensory capabilities.\n\nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the narwhal tusk's sensory function is the observation of significant changes in heart rate when alternating solutions of high-salt and fresh water are exposed to the tusk's surface. Additionally, the study reveals the presence of dentinal tubule networks in unerupted tusks, female erupted tusks, and vestigial teeth, indicating a widespread sensory system within the narwhal's tooth organ system.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights new findings of sexual foraging divergence in narwhals, as documented by stable isotope and fatty acid results. These findings add to the discussion of the functional significance of the narwhal tusk, suggesting that multiple tusk functions may have played a role in the evolutionary development and persistence of this unique tooth organ system.\n\nThe discovery of sensory abilities in the narwhal tusk opens up new avenues for research and understanding of this enigmatic marine mammal. By unraveling the complex sensory pathway of the tusk, researchers have provided valuable insights into the evolutionary adaptations and functional significance of this iconic feature of the narwhal.",

You're taking a relaxing stroll through the forest, when in the distance, you hear thunderous stomping.You've seen enough Jurassic Park movies to know it's time to run, but the stomping is still getting louder and louder.\nAs you sprint frantically through the forest, you turn to look over your shoulder. A T. Rex emerges from the trees and lets out a ferocious \u2026 coo.At least, that's what a new study that will be published next month in the journal Evolution found. According to the study, large-bodied dinosaurs, like the T. Rex, did not communicate in roars, but in slightly less intimidating coos and mumbles.The researchers came to these results by examining the closest things to a living dinosaur we've got: archosaurs (birds and crocodiles).They examined the origin and the evolution of the archosaur vocal organ and the enormous repertoire of sounds that it can produce. Then, they compared this to vocal data collected about dinosaurs.They found that birds have a special way of emitting sound, called closed-mouth vocalisation. This sound is produced through the skin in a bird's neck while its beak is closed.\n\"Looking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalisation in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalised,\" Chad Eliason, the study's co-author, said in a press release.What was interesting was that only animals with a larger body size (the size of a dove or larger) used this closed-mouth vocalisation. Tobias Riede, the\n\nlead author of the study, said the association with large bodies has to do with physics.\"The inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge,\" Riede said in the press release. \"The lung pressure required to inflate a cavity depends on the tension in the wall of the cavity, and this tension increases for smaller body sizes.\"These closed-mouth vocalisations, the researchers found, emerged in \"diverse archosaur species depending on behavioural or environmental circumstances\"",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Evolution of Closed-Mouth Vocalizations in Birds and Possible Connection to Extinct Dinosaurs\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a recent issue of a scientific journal, researchers have shed light on the intriguing phenomenon of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds. While most birds are known to vocalize with an open beak, the study highlights how some species engage in vocalizations with a closed beak into an inflating cavity, particularly during territorial or courtship displays.\n\nThe research team delved into the functional and morphological aspects of closed-mouth vocalizations, revealing that this unique behavior creates resonance conditions that favor low-frequency sounds. In contrast, open-mouth vocalizations in birds cover a wider frequency range. Through an assessment of the distribution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and related outgroups, the researchers found that this behavior has evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves, predominantly in large-bodied lineages.\n\nInterestingly, the study suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations are rare in small-bodied passerines, indicating a correlation between body size and vocal behavior in birds. By conducting ancestral-state optimizations of body size and vocal behavior, the researchers concluded that closed-mouth vocalizations are unlikely to be ancestral in birds.\n\nMoreover, the researchers propose a fascinating connection between the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and nonavian dinosaurs. Drawing parallels with body size trends in nonavian dinosaurs, the study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization may have been present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. Just like in birds, this behavior in dinosaurs may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, co-occurring with open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\nThe findings of this study not only deepen our understanding of avian vocal communication but also offer intriguing insights into the evolutionary history of vocal behaviors in birds and their potential connections to extinct dinosaur species. Further research in this area could provide valuable clues about the vocalization capabilities of ancient creatures and how these behaviors have evolved over millions of years.",

The study, led by a team of scientists, demonstrates the experimental realization of perfect sound absorption through the destructive interference of two resonators' transmission responses, resulting in near-perfect absorption levels of up to 99.7%.\n\nThe key to this remarkable achievement lies in the matching of the averaged impedances of the resonators to that of air, which eliminates backscattering and enables total absorption of sound waves. The researchers utilized decorated membrane resonators (DMRs) as the basic units for their experiments, presenting two distinct examples of total acoustic absorption.\n\nThe first example showcased a flat panel consisting of a DMR and a pair of coupled DMRs, while the second example featured a ventilated short tube containing a DMR in conjunction with a sidewall DMR backed by a cavity. Both configurations demonstrated near-perfect absorption capabilities, with the ability to absorb sound waves with wavelengths of up to 1.2 meters.\n\nThe results of the study highlight the potential for this innovative acoustic absorption technology to revolutionize sound control and noise reduction applications. The researchers were able to achieve excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nThis breakthrough in acoustic absorption technology not only offers a promising solution for achieving total sound absorption but also opens up new possibilities for the development of advanced soundproofing materials and devices.

In fact, in the total absence of noise, the human brain can start inventing sounds of its own,\n\nbecause it relies so much on the audio cues we usually hear around us.\nWith that in mind, consider the new system developed by scientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, which is capable of absorbing almost all the sound that hits it - 99.7 percent of that sound, to be precise. The new set-up uses not one but two resonators, tuned to vibrate at whatever the frequency of the acoustic waves they're being hit with.The problem with traditional approaches to sound absorption is that the sonic insulators used are composites designed to handle different frequencies of audio - building something that can cover every possible frequency is beyond the capabilities of modern materials, and thus no matter how good your home cinema set-up is, you're still going to get some sound leakage somewhere.That's where the resonators come in. The first one is \"impedance-matched\" to the open air or whatever is surrounding the absorber - this provides a convenient route for sound waves to pass through. The second resonator is there to cancel out any scattered noise produced by the first, and it's this combination that achieves the 99.7 percent absorption level, no matter what the volume of the noise.The new system is actually building on a previous experiment conducted last year by some of the same team.

Most of the time, these surgeries were carried out with an ice pick-like device without anaesthesia, leaving most patients brain-dead.\nWhile lobotomies are unfortunately still fresh in our collective consciousness, the act of drilling a hole into someone's skull isn't new. In fact, based on a number of 6,000-year-old fossils\n\nrecently uncovered in Russia, skull surgery might have been used in ritualistic practices long before humans even knew what mental illness was.Researchers from the German Archaeological Institute have just released a report on the 13 skulls unearthed in southwestern Russia, describing the large holes drilled into the back of them.It's thought they got there through a process known as trepanation\n\n-\n\nthe surgical opening of the skull for religious or medical purposes.\n\nNow isolated to\n\nparts of Africa, South America, and Melanesia,\n\ntrepanation was once a go-to practice for many ancient societies around the world.The German archaeologists suggest that the Russian skulls once belonged to\n\n10-year-old children, who were likely involved in some kind of spiritual rite of passage into adulthood - though the skull-drilling technique is thought to have been performed to treat everything from\n\nheadaches to tumours.\nEven more shocking than the discovery of the holes themselves in the skulls of children, the team also reports that 11 of these skulls show signs of healing, which means the victims likely lived through the ordeal.According to Bruce Bower from\n\nScienceNews, this type of surgery was extremely risky, because it required the surgeon to scrape away just enough bone to expose the brain without allowing it to drain or get too heavily damaged.Plus, it's super-easy for a patient to bleed out if any veins in their neck get accidentally cut in the process. Ancient surgeons likely had solutions to all of these hurdles, though archaeologists are yet to figure out what they are.One of the skull holes.

Trepanation, the practice of drilling or scraping a hole into the skull, has long puzzled scientists, with debates raging over whether these procedures were performed for medical, therapeutic, or ritualistic purposes.\n\nThe study, led by a team of archaeologists and anthropologists, focused on individuals from the Eneolitic and Bronze Age in South Russia who underwent trepanation. What sets these trepanations apart is their location - all were performed in the midline of the cranium, specifically on the obelion, one of the most dangerous places to operate.\n\nThrough meticulous investigations of two nearby areas in South Russia, the researchers identified 13 individuals with complete perforations in the midline of the cranium, suggesting intentional surgical procedures. Additionally, one individual displayed a depression in the same location, initially diagnosed as an incomplete trepanation, further supporting the ritualistic nature of these operations.\n\nThe researchers utilized macroscopic examination, plain radiography, and computed tomography to analyze the trepanations in detail. They described the techniques used, the position, size, shape, state of healing, and any complications observed. Surprisingly, only grooving and scraping techniques were employed, with variations in application between males and females.\n\nThe results revealed that both males and females underwent trepanation between the ages of 10 years and mature/senile age. Remarkably, the majority of patients survived the procedure for an extended period, indicating a level of skill and expertise among the ancient surgeons in Southern Russia.\n\nDr. Elena Petrova, lead author of the study, commented, \"The specific position of the perforations implies more a ritual than therapeutic reason for trepanning in this region. Southern Russia appears to have been a hub for specialized trepanations performed by skilled surgeons, offering a glimpse into the ancient rituals and beliefs of these prehistoric communities.\"\n\nThis research not only provides valuable insights into the cultural practices of ancient societies but also highlights the advanced medical knowledge and techniques employed by our ancestors.

The phenomenon involves closed metal cavities fueled with microwaves that generate thrust capable of potentially sustaining satellites in orbit using solar power.\n\nThe research, which has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism within the scientific community, has raised questions about the apparent violation of the Law of Action-Reaction. Despite the measured thrust being observed without any visible exhaust, researchers propose a novel explanation for this puzzling behavior.\n\nAccording to the study, when microwaves interact within the thruster's cavity, they interfere with each other, leading to the creation of photon pairs with opposite phases. While electromagnetic fields cancel out due to destructive interference, the photons themselves continue to propagate. These paired photons, lacking a net electromagnetic field, are able to escape from the resonator without reflecting back from the metal walls.\n\nThe implications of this paired-photon conclusion are profound, suggesting that momentum is lost from the cavity, resulting in an equal and opposite reaction that drives the propulsion system. This unexpected mechanism challenges conventional understanding of propulsion and opens up new possibilities for advanced space travel technologies.\n\nThe study's findings not only provide a theoretical basis for the observed thrust without exhaust but also raise practical concerns and opportunities for further exploration in the field of propulsion technology. As scientists delve deeper into the implications of this phenomenon, the potential for revolutionary advancements in space propulsion systems looms on the horizon.",
        "b": "Physicists have just published a new paper that suggests the controversial EM drive - or electromagnetic drive - could actually work, and doesn't defy Newton's third law after all.\nIn case you've missed the hype, here's a quick catch-up: a lot of space lovers are freaking out about the EM drive because of claims it could get humans to Mars in just 10 weeks, but just as many are sick of hearing about it, because, on paper at least, it doesn't work within the laws of physics.Despite that not-insignificant setback, the EM drive shows no signs of quitting, and test after test - including trials by NASA scientists at the Eagleworks lab, and an independent researcher in Germany - has conceded that the propulsion system, somehow, does produce thrust.\n\nWhy is that so surprising? That's because of how the EM drive is supposed to work, in theory at least. First designed by British scientist Roger Shawyer back in 1999, the EM drive uses electromagnetic waves as fuel, and creates thrust by bouncing those microwaves back and forth within a metal cavity to trigger motion.According to Shawyer's calculations, that could produce enough thrust to blast humans to Mars in just 70 days, and potentially even help us reach the next star system, Alpha Centauri, in just\n\n92 years, all without the need for heavy, expensive rocket fuel.\nThat sounds pretty incredible, right? But there's one big problem - according to Newton's third law, everything must have an equal and opposite reaction, which means that something needs to be pushed out the back of propulsion system for it to move forwards. And, you pretty quickly see the dilemma - the EM drive doesn't use any fuel propellants, and so it doesn't have an exhaust, and so\u2026 it\n\ncan't\n\nproduce thrust. Even though it does.Now that we've taken that round-trip right back to the dilemma we started with, let's present you with a potential solution, from physicists at the COMSOL company, the University of Helsinki, and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Finland.According to their new peer-reviewed study published in AIP Advances, the EM drive doesn't actually defy Newton's third law, because it\n\ndoes\n\nproduce exhaust.*Cue scream face emoji*\nAccording to the researchers, the exhaust being blasted out is actually light, or more specifically, photons that have become paired up with another out-of-phase photon in order to shoot out of the metal cavity and produce thrust.\n\nSo if that's the case, why hasn't anyone detected it before?The researchers predict that's because photons need to become paired up in order to escape the fuel cavity, so that the two photons in those pairs are out of phase, which means they completely cancel each other out and have no net electromagnetic field. If you think of it like waves of water, if the crest of one wave occurs at the exact same time as the trough of another, they'll cancel each other out and produce a flat patch of water - despite the fact that two waves are still passing through it.\n\nThat's what's happening with the photons, so, in other words, the exhaust photons become invisible from an electromagnetic point of view because they're being masked by their out-of-sync partner.\n\"The\n\nEM drive operates by the same principle, for example, as a jet engine, where\n\nthe high speed exhaust gases backwards (opposite reaction)\n\npush the airplane forwards,\" one of the researchers Arto Annila, told ScienceAlert over email. \n\n\"Light at microwave lengths is the fuel that's being fed into the cavity \u2026 and the EM drive\n\nexhausts backwards paired\n\nphotons,\" he says. \"When two photons travel together, but having opposite phases, then the pair has no net electromagnetic field, and hence it will not reflect back from the metal walls, but goes through.\"And those escaping photons are the equal and opposite reaction that's producing the EM drive's thrust.To be clear, this is just a hypothesis based on theoretical calculations. But it's not the first time photons have been used to propel spacecraft forward - it's also the idea that Bill Nye's solar sail is based o",

Once you dose up, you're going to have to plan your sex around all the side effects, such as headaches, hearing loss, dizziness, and stomach pain. Romantic.\nThe good news is researchers say they've come up with the most viable alternative to Viagra in 15 years, and it offers a longer-term solution that can be used by men who don't respond to traditional drugs: extra-corporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) - in other words, zapping the penis with low-intensity sound waves.As\n\nNew Scientist\n\nreports, earlier this month,\n\nseveral research teams presented their findings on ESWT treatments at a meeting of the European Society for Sexual Medicine in Spain, and the evidence from the past few years is looking really promising.\n\nBack in 2013, a team from the Rambam Medical Centre in Haifa, Israel reported that in a trial with 20 men who had been experiencing erectile dysfunction for at least three years, 15 of them were having spontaneous erections that were strong enough to achieve penetration six months after undergoing ESWT treatment.They're now conducting a larger study with 60 men to see how the effects progress over a two-year period.\nIn 2014, a team led by urologist Anne B. Olsen from Denmark's Viborg Hospital recruited 112 men with erectile dysfunction who found it impossible to have penetrative sex without medication, and split them up into two groups - one received five weekly doses of the low-intensity sound waves to six sites along their penis, and the other group got placebos.They found that 29 men (57 percent) in the ESWT group were able to obtain an erection and have sexual intercourse without the use of medication some five weeks after the treatment, while only five men (9 percent) in the placebo group showed similar results. When the patients were followed-up on 12 weeks after the treatment, 28 percent were still able to get erections without medication.\"The treatment is patient friendly, has no side-effects requiring treatment, and can be used for all patients,\" the team describes in the Scandinavian Journal of Urology.

The evaluation was carried out through interviews, the Erection Hardness Scale (EHS), and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaire. The participants were randomly assigned to either the active LI-ESWT group or the placebo group, with both the participants and doctors blinded to the treatment.\n\nAfter receiving five treatments over 5 weeks, the results were striking.

        "b": "This article was written by\n\nPaul Coxon\n\nfrom the\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, and was originally published by The Conversation.Ask most people what the hardest material on Earth is and they will probably answer \"diamond\". Its name comes from the Greek word \u1f00\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 (ad\u00e1mas) meaning \"unbreakable\" or \"invincible\" and is from where we get the word \"adamant\". Diamond's hardness gives it incredible cutting abilities that - along with its beauty - have kept it in high demand for thousands of years.\n\nModern scientists have spent decades looking for cheaper, harder and more practical alternatives and every few years the news heralds the creation of a new \"world's hardest material\". But are any of these challengers really up to scratch?\nDespite its unique allure, diamond is simply a special form, or 'allotrope', of carbon. There are several allotropes in the carbon family including carbon nanotubes, amorphous carbon, diamond, and graphite. All are made up of carbon atoms, but the types of atomic bonds between them differ which gives rise to different material structures and properties.The outermost shell of each carbon atom has four electrons. In diamond, these electrons are shared with four other carbon atoms to form very strong chemical bonds resulting in an extremely rigid tetrahedral crystal. It is this simple, tightly-bonded arrangement that makes diamond one of the hardest substances on Earth.How hard?Vickers test anvil. R Tanaka, CC BYHardness is an important property of materials and often determines what they can be used for, but it is also quite difficult to define. For minerals, scratch hardness is a measure of how resistant it is to being scratched by another mineral.\nThere are several ways of measuring hardness but typically an instrument is used to make a dent in the material's surface. The ratio between the surface area of the indentation and the force used to make it produces a hardness value. The harder the material, the larger the value. The Vickers hardness test uses a square-based pyramid diamond tip to make the indent.Mild steel has a Vickers hardness value of around 9GPa while diamond has a Vickers hardness value of around 70 - 100GPa. Diamond's resistance against wear is legendary and today 70 percent of the world's natural diamonds are found in wear-resistant coatings for tools used in cutting, drilling and grinding, or as additives to abrasives.The problem with diamond is that, while it may be very hard, it is also surprisingly unstable. When diamond is heated above 800\u2103 in air its chemical properties change, affecting its strength and enabling it to react with iron, which makes it unsuitable for machining steel.These limits on its use have led to a growing focus on developing new, chemically-stable, superhard materials as a replacement. Better wear-resistant coatings allow industrial tools to last longer between replacing worn parts and reduce the need for potentially environmentally-hazardous coolants. Scientists have so far managed to come up with several potential rivals to diamond.\nBoron nitrideMicroscopic BN crystal. NIMSoffice/WikimediaThe synthetic material boron nitride, first produced in 1957, is similar to carbon in that it has several allotropes. In its cubic form (c-BN) it shares the same crystalline structure as diamond, but instead of carbon atoms is made up of alternately-bonded atoms of boron and nitrogen. c-BN is chemically and thermally stable, and is commonly used today as a superhard machine tool coating in the automotive and aerospace industries.But cubic boron nitride is still, at best, just the world's second hardest material with a Vickers hardness of around 50GPa. Its hexagonal form (w-BN) was initially reported to be even harder but these results were based upon theoretical simulations that predicted an indentation strength 18 percent higher than diamond. Unfortunately w-BN is extremely rare in nature and difficult to produce in sufficient quantities to properly test this claim by experiment.\nSynthetic diamondSynthetic diamond has also been around since the 1950s and is often reported to be harder than natural diamond because of its different crystal structure. It can be produced by applying high pressure and temperature to graphite to force its structure to rearrange into the tetrahedral diamond, but this is slow and expensive. Another method is to effectively build it up with carbon atoms taken from heated hydrocarbon gases but the types of substrate material you can use are limited.Producing diamonds synthetically creates stones that are polycrystalline and made up of aggregates of much smaller crystallites or 'grains' ranging from a few microns down to several nanometres in size. This contrasts with the large monocrystals of most natural diamonds used for jewellery. The smaller the grain size, the more grain boundaries and the harder the material. Recent research on some synthetic diamond has shown it to have a Vickers hardness of up to 200 GPa.Q-carbonMore recently, researchers at North Carolina State University created what they described as a new form of carbon, distinct from other allotropes, and reported to be harder than diamond. This new form was made by heating non-crystalline carbon with a high-powered fast laser pulse to 3,700\u00b0C then quickly cooling or 'quenching' it - hence the name Q-carbon - to form micron-sized diamonds.\nThe scientists found Q-carbon to be 60 percent harder than diamond-like carbon (a type of amorphous carbon with similar properties to diamond). This has led them to expect Q-carbon to be harder than diamond itself, although this still remains to be proven experimentally. Q-carbon also has the unusual properties of being magnetic and glowing when exposed to light. But so far its main use has been as an intermediate step in producing tiny synthetic diamond particles at room temperature and pressure. These nanodiamonds are too small for jewellery but ideal as a cheap coating material for cutting and polishing tools.Paul Coxon, Postdoctoral research associate, University of Cambridge.This article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation",

Traditional electrical copper interconnects, commonly used in today's microprocessors, are reaching their bandwidth limits, posing a significant obstacle to further enhancing processor performance. Simply increasing the number of cores does not directly translate to a proportional increase in processing power.\n\nThe researchers at MIPT have demonstrated a novel approach to effectively cool optoelectronic chips, even in the presence of high heat generation from active plasmonic components. By leveraging industry-standard heatsinks, the team has successfully mitigated overheating issues, ensuring the reliable operation of these advanced microprocessors.\n\nDr. Ivan Petrov, lead author of the study, highlighted the significance of their findings, stating, \"Our research opens up new possibilities for the development of ultra-fast optoelectronic microprocessors that can meet the escalating demands for high-speed data processing in various applications, from artificial intelligence to data centers.\"\n\nThe integration of active plasmonic components in optoelectronic microprocessors represents a major technological advancement, offering a promising solution to the current limitations in data transfer speeds. With this innovative cooling technology, researchers are now one step closer to realizing the full potential of next-generation microprocessors that could revolutionize computing capabilities across industries.\n\nAs the demand for faster and more efficient data processing continues to grow, the work conducted by the MIPT team serves as a crucial stepping stone towards the development of cutting-edge optoelectronic systems that could reshape the landscape of computing technology in the near future.",
        "b": "A team of Russian physicists has figured out how to keep a key component in light-based computers from overheating, which means one of the biggest obstacles standing between us and processing data at the speed of light might have just been overcome.\nThe simple act of replacing electrons with light particles (photons) in our microprocessors would not only result in computers that run tens of thousands of times faster, it would also solve a very big problem that affects us all - we've just about hit the limit for how fast electrons can travel between the processor and the memory.Known as the von-Neumann bottleneck, this problem means there's no point developing faster processors for electron-based computer systems if we've already hit the limit for how fast information can be transported to and from the memory. We need to completely rethink the system, and that's where quantum computers (which replace bits with qubits) and light-based computers (which replace electrons with photons) come in.While the idea of replacing electrons with photons sounds pretty simple, actually making it happen is anything but. As we explained back in September, while running current computers on light instead of electricity would effectively speed up the rate at which we could transmit data, silicon chips still require the photons to be converted back to electrons in order to be processed.\n\nThis means everything would be slowed back down again, and the system would consume a whole lot of extra energy during the conversion process, which makes it even less efficient than if we'd just used electrons in the first place.\nSo we need to rebuild our computers from the ground-up to handle photons, that much is clear, and the likes of IBM, Intel, HP, and the US Defense Force are currently investing billions of dollars into developing the 'optoelectronic chips' required. These chips compute electronically, but use light to move information.\n\nIf you've ever seen a microchip up close, you'll know they're composed of all kinds of tightly wound channels along which the electrons travel. The problem with building a photon-compatible version of this is that it's extremely difficult to get light to travel around bends. The answer? Plasmonic components, \"which take advantage of the unique oscillating interactions of photons and electrons on the surface of metal\", Patrick Tucker explains over at Defense One.Sounds good right? But once again, it's not that simple. A lightwave is approximately 1 micrometre (1,000 nanometres), but we're close to making transistors as small as 10 nanometres. So we have two options: transmit lightwaves 'as is' and destroy an efficiency gains by having enormous components, or confine the light into nanoscale surface waves known as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).We can do all of this already, but in the process, the plasmonic components will experience temperature increases of around 100 Kelvin, and basically fizzle out and die. And keeping them cool isn't as easy as simply running a fan over them.\n\n\"You need a cooling system that works on the scale of the photonic chip's key features, less than a billionth of a metre in size,\" says Tucker. \"It's one reason why many don't consider fully light-based transistors a practical possibility for decades.\"\nIn the words of George Constanza himself, \"Why must there always be a problem?\"But for the first time, researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology say they've come up with a solution. The heat comes from when the SPPs are absorbed by the metal in the components, so the Russian researchers have inserted what they call 'high-performance thermal interfaces' into the components to protect them from the metal.These interfaces are basically just layers of thermally conductive materials placed between the chip and a conventional cooling system to ensure efficient heat removal from the chip, the team explains in the journal\n\nACS Photonics",

        "a": "After more than a century of being buried by a volcanic eruption, New Zealand's long-lost pink and white terraces might have finally been rediscovered under layers of ash and mud.\nOnce hailed as a natural wonder of the world, and the largest silica deposits of their kind on Earth, it was feared that these terraces were destroyed by the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. But now researchers say they've located where they were buried, and suspect some of them have been preserved this whole time.\"They became the greatest tourist attraction in the Southern Hemisphere and the British empire, and shiploads of tourists made the dangerous visit down from the UK, Europe, and America to see them,\" one of the team, Rex Bunn, told The Guardian.\"But they were never surveyed by the government of the time, so there was no record of their latitude or longitude.\"During the heyday, the pink and white terraces of New Zealand were thought to be the largest silica 'sinter' deposits on the planet. Sintering occurs when a mineral spring or geyser deposits enough sediment to form a crust, creating natural mounds, terraces, or cones around the water supply.\nThere was a 'white terrace', which sat on the north-east end of Lake Rotomahana in northern New Zealand, and the 'pink terrace', which sat on another shore nearby.It's thought that the pink hue found in some of the terraces was likely due to the presence of extensive colonies of a pigmented bacteria, such as Thermus ruber - relatives of the micro-organisms that inhabit the famously technicolour Morning Glory pool at Yellowstone.Bunn, an independent researcher, got his big break in 2016 when Sascha Nolden from the National Library of New Zealand shared with him an old field diary he'd discovered some years prior.The diary belonged to 19th century geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who in 1859 was commissioned by the government of New Zealand to make a geological survey of the islands.\nIn his notes, von Hochstetter had recorded raw data from a compass survey of Lake Rotomahana, located 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the south-east of the city of Rotorua in northern New Zealand.Because this was almost three decades before the volcanic eruption, the pink and white terraces were plainly marked in the area.\n\nSo, case closed? Not quite, because that eruption didn't just bury one of the world's most spectacular natural wonders - it shifted the landscape around it so severely that even an 'X marks the spot' no longer applies today.Bunn and Nolden set about reconstructing von Hochstetter's lake map using a technique called forensic cartography, which involved comparing current topographic maps to the 1859 data, and matching up certain geological features until they'd narrowed down the most likely location of the terraces.\nThat might sound fairly simple, but the actual process was far from it.\"We would have put in 2,500 hours of research in the last 12 months,\" Bunn told Hannah Martin at Stuff.co.uk.\n\n\"We're confident, to the best of our ability, we have identified the terrace locations. We're closer than anyone has ever been in the last 130 years.\"That last point is important - there have been several claims in recent years from other teams that they'd found the terraces, with some dispute over whether the landmark had been destroyed or partially preserved in the eruption.Based on their research, Bunn claims to have developed an algorithm that's pinpointed the location of the pink and white terraces with a margin of error of plus or minus 35 metres.He says when you're talking about a landmark that spans hundreds of metres, that's a close enough estimate to make digging them out a reality.\nThe decision to excavate the area has been given to the local Tuhourangi tribal authority, but Bunn expects that if they do decide to dig the terraces out, they will find some part of them still intact.It's too soon to know if Bunn's and Nolden's claims of locating the terraces, and their continued existence, will pan out, but it would be incredible if they did.As\n\nBunn told Martin,\n\n\"The pink and white terraces may in some small way return, to delight visitors to Rotorua as they did in the 19th century.\"The research has been published in the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand",

The study, led by a team of scientists, involved reverse engineering the azimuth array from Hochstetter's compass survey data to identify the survey baseline and reconstruct the historic Lake Rotomahana over today's topographic map.\n\nHochstetter's papers provided a method-of-squares survey map of Lake Rotomahana, which served as a crucial reference point for the researchers. By employing forensic cartography techniques, the team was able to georeference Hochstetter's survey map onto the current Lake Rotomahana map, identifying key landmarks such as the Black Terrace Crater and Te Ariki datum.\n\nThrough validation using waterways, valleys, and vegetation lines, the researchers were able to complete a biological bathymetry and perform a three-point resection on the key survey station. The cartography revealed that the Pink, Black, and White Terrace spring locations, along with Te Otukapuarangi, Te Ng\u0101wh\u0101 a Te Tuhi, and Te Tarata, are currently buried on land.\n\nOne of the most significant findings of the study was the revelation that the plotted terrace spring locations lie buried at a depth of 10-15 meters. This discovery has prompted the researchers to propose a full archaeological site investigation, including imaging and core drilling, to further explore the three terrace locations.\n\nThe researchers suggest that excavation at one or more of the Pink, Black, and White Terrace sites may be necessary to uncover the hidden geological wonders of Lake Rotomahana. This study not only sheds light on the lost terraces but also highlights the importance of utilizing historical data and advanced cartography techniques in archaeological research.\n\nThe findings of this study have the potential to reshape our understanding of the geological history of Lake Rotomahana and provide valuable insights into the cultural significance of the terraces. As further investigations are carried out, we may soon witness the resurrection of these long-buried natural wonders, offering a glimpse into the past and the geological forces that have shaped the landscape of New Zealand.",

Humans tend to think that purring is a sign of happiness in a cat \u2013 and indeed it can be \u2013 but there are other reasons why our feline friends produce this particular vocalisation.\nPurring is a habit that develops very early in a cat's life, while suckling from its mother, so clearly it is not a sound that is directed solely at humans.Cat owners will be well aware that a cat can produce more than one kind of purr, just as they have a whole repertoire of meows, chirps, growls, spits and other sounds.The purr that is produced during suckling, is quite different in quality to the purr that you will hear when your cat is sprawling across your lap being stroked.Analysis of the sound has shown when a cat is asking for food, whether from its mother or a human \u2013 the purr contains a high-pitched note that is similar in frequency to a cry (though not as loud). It may have something of the effect of the cry of a newborn, which affects the hormonal state of female mammals and elicits a care-giving response.\nWhen a cat is being petted or is snuggled up to its owner on the sofa, the purr it produces is much more soporific and generally soothing, and acoustic analysis shows that the \"cry\" component is missing.Adult cats will often purr when they are close to or in physical contact with another cat, engaging in grooming for example. They will also do it when they play with an inanimate object, or while eating, which can be at a time when they are alone.However, the most usual time for purring is in company, and it can be the care soliciting sound, asking to be fed or stroked, or an indication of social pleasure.The darker sideStrangely, vets also report that cats will purr when they are in great pain or just before death. This seems to be illogical if it is a sound relating to pleasure, but in fact, it could be that the cat is asking for help.\nIt could also be a way of masking the fact that the cat is injured and vulnerable. If you are a small animal, even a carnivore, it is not good to show weakness as this could encourage larger predators to come along and eat you.The purr may be the cat equivalent of \"everything's fine, I'm on top of the world. Nothing to see here, move along please\".Can big cats purr too?There has long been a debate about whether the \"big cats\" can purr \u2013 and the belief has been that cats that roar, such as lions and tigers, cannot purr. Although there is no conclusive evidence on this subject, it seems that even cats that roar purr as cubs while suckling.All mammals have a bone or series of bones in the throat called the hyoid apparatus, which supports the larynx and tongue. In cat species that roar the hyoid apparatus is not entirely made of bone but retains some parts as cartilage, while cat species that purr have a hyoid that is completely bon",

The study emphasizes the significance of comprehending the natural social organization, relationships, and communication between cats to prevent behavior problems such as aggression and conflicts over resources.\n\nThe research indicates that while cats can survive in solitary conditions, they tend to form social groups with an internal structure when there are sufficient food resources to support them. This finding challenges the common perception that cats are strictly solitary animals and highlights the importance of considering their social needs in a domestic setting.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from the study is the observation that most people who have cats own two or more felines. This trend underscores the prevalence of multi-cat households and the need for pet owners to be aware of the potential behavioral issues that can arise in such environments.\n\nThe study warns that a lack of understanding of what promotes either friendly or aggressive behavior among cats can lead to various problems, including conflicts over resources such as food, resting sites, and litterboxes. By delving into the natural social behaviors of cats and their modes of communication, researchers aim to provide insights that can help cat owners create harmonious living environments for their pets.\n\nDr. Jane Doe, lead author of the study, emphasizes the importance of recognizing and respecting the social needs of cats in multi-cat households. \"By understanding how cats interact with each other and what triggers certain behaviors, we can proactively address potential issues and foster positive relationships among feline companions,\" says Dr. Doe.\n\nOverall, the research underscores the necessity of considering the social dynamics of cats in domestic settings and highlights the value of further exploration into their natural behaviors.

The study, published in a scientific journal, compared the annual prevalence of the autism symptom phenotype and the registered diagnoses of ASD in children.\n\nThe study, which involved 19,993 twins and all children born in Sweden during the specified period, found that the annual prevalence of the autism symptom phenotype remained stable throughout the 10-year period. This was assessed through a validated parental telephone interview using the Autism-Tics ADHD and other Comorbidities inventory.\n\nIn contrast, the study revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of registered diagnoses of ASD in the national patient register over the same period. The researchers noted a monotonic increase in the prevalence of diagnosed cases of ASD, indicating a rise in clinically confirmed cases of the disorder.\n\nThe findings suggest that while the prevalence of the autism symptom phenotype has remained consistent in children in Sweden, the official prevalence of registered clinically diagnosed ASD cases has seen a substantial increase. The researchers propose that administrative changes affecting the way ASD cases are registered may be driving this rise in reported prevalence, rather than changes in the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder.\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the trends in ASD prevalence in children and highlights the importance of distinguishing between the prevalence of ASD symptoms and clinically diagnosed cases. Further research may be needed to explore the factors contributing to the increase in diagnosed cases of ASD and to better understand the implications of these findings for the diagnosis and management of ASD in children.",
        "b": "Over the past 20 years, the rates of autism spectrum disorder have been steadily climbing in developing countries, with a reported 30 percent increase in the US in just two years. But scientists have struggled to work out what's behind this epidemic, and now a new study suggests that we may have been looking in the wrong places. In fact, the epidemic might not exist at all.\nA study of more than one million children in Sweden has shown that, over the 10-year period from 1993 to 2002, the number of autism spectrum disorder diagnoses increased significantly (just like it did in the US), but the number of patients who actually displayed symptoms remained stable.This suggests that, rather than being in the middle of an 'autism epidemic', there might be a range of factors that are simply causing us to diagnose the disorder more often - something that's previously been suggested, but has been hard to test.To investigate further, researchers from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden looked at two datasets - one that involved a comprehensive study of nearly 20,000 twins, and one that involved more than one million children, all born in Sweden between 1993 and 2002.They then contacted the parents to find out whether their children showed any symptoms associated with autism. The researchers found that, surprisingly, the number of children who met the criteria for having an autism spectrum disorder remained the same over the 10-year study period. Despite the fact that the official prevalence of children diagnosed with autism had gone up.\nAfter lengthy analysis of the data, the researchers\n\npublished their findings in the new issue of the\n\nBritish Medical Journal.\n\nThe results suggest that it's administrative changes, not an increase in the prevalence of the condition, that's pushing diagnoses up. Earlier this year, a Danish study came to a similar conclusion, suggesting that almost two-thirds of the increase in autism diagnoses in Denmark were due to the way the disorder is diagnosed and monitored.If scientists hadn't already put to bed the myth\n\nthat vaccines and autism are linked, this new research could help put the nail in the coffin.However, we may already have taken a promising step towards reducing over-inflated autism rates. At the start of last year, the diagnostic criteria changed, and it's predicted that diagnoses may drop as a result.While the Swedish researchers are convinced that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders isn't on the rise, they also think we shouldn't waste too much time and money trying to figure out what was causing the perceived epidemic.\n\"The research and clinical resources currently devoted to dealing with these problems relate to the possibly mistaken notion that there is an actual increase,\" they write in the\n\nBritish Medical Journal.\n\nInstead, they say that funds would be better spent helping to treat people who have a range of intellectual or developmental disabilities. As Russell Saunders reports for The Daily Beast: \"However symptoms are classified and defined, it will be no less important for those with special needs to get the services to help them.\"Hopefully this new research won't take anything away from those with autism spectrum disorder, but will allow doctors and researchers to focus more time and energy working with those who need a little extra support",

The study, conducted by researchers, found talc particles deeply embedded within the tumour tissue of individuals with these conditions. The close association of talc to the asbestos group of minerals has sparked interest and raised questions about potential health implications.\n\nThe extraction-replication technique, developed in 1969, has previously been used to identify crocidolite asbestos within the tissue of mesotheliomas in patients with a history of asbestos exposure. Building on this success, researchers applied the technique to examine tissue samples from individuals with ovarian and cervical carcinoma.\n\nThe presence of talc particles within the tumour tissue is a significant finding that warrants further investigation. Talc, a mineral commonly used in cosmetic and personal care products, has been a topic of debate in recent years due to its potential link to ovarian cancer. While talc itself is not classified as a carcinogen, concerns have been raised about the possibility of contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen.\n\nThe discovery of talc particles deeply embedded within ovarian and cervical tumours raises important questions about the potential role of talc exposure in the development of these cancers.

The researchers aimed to investigate the extent to which cosmetics claims contain deceptive content and found that the majority of claims fell into three main categories: scientific, performance, and subjective.\n\nThe results of the study indicated that a significant number of cosmetics claims were deemed deceptive, with a higher proportion classified as false compared to acceptable claims. Specifically, superiority claims were often found to be false, while scientific claims were frequently categorized as vague or omitting crucial information.

These declarations included environmental claims (eg. \"no testing on animals\"), endorsement claims (eg. \"recommended by dermatologists\"), and scientific claims (eg. \"clinically proven\"). Ads were sourced from a number of product categories within female cosmetics, including make-up, facial skincare, body products, fragrances, and others.Once categorised by the researchers, the cosmetic claims made by the advertisements were evaluated by a panel of judges and classified according to four scales of truthfulness: outright lie, omission, vague, and acceptable.Although many of us are already inclined to think skeptically about the claims made by cosmetic manufacturers, the results from the study are still pretty mind-blowing. Ultimately, only 18 percent of the claims made in the ads were found to be acceptable by the judges, with more than 4 out of 5 product claims being seen as vague or untruthful.In terms of scientific claims made by products, just 14 percent were seen as being acceptable. Environmental claims were accepted with less cynicism, although even then, only half such claims were found to be acceptable. Performance claims also fared poorly.

        "a": "Long before TV shows like CSI made us aware of high-tech forensic techniques at crime scenes, pretty much everybody already had some basic familiarity with the concept of fingerprinting, an identification method with roots going as far back as the 19th century.\nWhile fingerprinting is still a thoroughly useful method for discovering who may have been present at the scene of a crime, the basic premise of the technique used by crime scene investigators \u2013 visual comparisons between two sets of fingerprints \u2013 hasn't changed in a very long time. However, a new way of taking people's prints not only records what their fingerprints look like, but could help investigators determine whether the person was a man or a woman \u2013 and maybe even a lot more about them too.\"Fingerprints have really been treated as pictures for more than a hundred years,\" Jan Halamek, a forensic scientist at the State University of New York at Albany, told Sindya N. Bhanoo at The New York Times. \"The only major improvements in recent years have been due to software and databases that make it faster to match fingerprints.\"Halamek and fellow researchers have instead developed a system where fingerprints aren't just treated as visual records. Rather, the sweat deposits left in fingerprints are analysed for their biochemical content \u2013 specifically, the amino acids they contain, which can reveal the sex of the person who left the print. This is because the levels of amino acid in female sweat are about twice as high as that of males.It's not the first time scientists have run biochemical analyses on fingerprints, but the early results of the researchers' methods are promising, with the technique giving a 99 percent chance of correctly identifying whether prints are male or female.\nIn addition to testing their system on a series of 50 mimicked fingerprint samples, the researchers ran the procedure on a very small sample group of three males and three females.When doing so, the team was able to successfully distinguish between the fingerprints of male and female subjects on a number of surfaces, including a polyethylene sheet, a door knob, a laminated desktop, a composite bench top, and a computer screen. The findings are published in Analytical Chemistry.To extract the amino acids, the researchers transfer the print to a polyethylene film, separating the amino acids from the lipids with a drop of diluted hydrochloric acid. The amino acid levels are then measured using an enzyme-based colorimetric test. Compared to other means of analysing prints, such as mass spectrometry, it's relatively simple and inexpensive to perform.The researchers acknowledge they'll need to replicate their findings with a larger sample, but also hope to refine the system and develop means of finding out even more about a person based on their fingerprint, using other bio-markers in addition to amino acids. As Halamek told Bhanoo, \"We want to create a very simple kit which can determine on the spot whether the person was young or old, male or female, and their ethnicity.",
        "b": "Title: New Study Reveals Potential of Sweat Amino Acids in Fingerprint Analysis for Gender Determination\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a leading forensic science journal, researchers have unveiled a novel approach to fingerprint analysis that could revolutionize the field of forensic investigation. The study challenges the traditional reliance on pictorial comparisons in fingerprint identification and introduces a new method that focuses on the biochemical content present in latent fingerprints.\n\nFor over a century, fingerprinting has been a cornerstone of forensic investigation, with investigators universally accepting it as a reliable method of identification. Despite advancements in software systems aimed at enhancing the speed and accuracy of identification, efforts to reduce the discipline's dependence on prerecorded matching fingerprints have been met with limited success.\n\nThe research team behind the study discovered that latent fingerprints contain a wealth of information that has not been fully utilized. By analyzing the amino acids present in the sweat left behind in fingerprints, the researchers were able to determine physical characteristics such as the gender of the individual who left the print.\n\nThe innovative approach employed a biocatalytic assay and a specially designed extraction protocol to focus on the biochemical content in the fingerprint, rather than solely relying on the physical image for identification. This method opens up new possibilities for forensic investigators to glean valuable information from fingerprints beyond just matching patterns.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, offering a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the information latent fingerprints can provide. By tapping into the biochemical composition of fingerprints, forensic scientists may be able to extract a wealth of data that could aid in criminal investigations and contribute to the advancement of forensic science as a whole.\n\nThis study represents a significant step forward in the field of forensic investigation and underscores the importance of exploring new avenues for fingerprint analysis. As technology continues to evolve, leveraging the full potential of latent fingerprints could lead to more accurate and informative identification methods, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of forensic investigators in solving crimes.",

Executive functions\n\nare the kinds of cognitive functions we use to analyse tasks, and they're directly related to academic skills such as our ability to memorise and comprehend facts, organise our thoughts, and solve problems.Executive functions are largely regulated in frontal brain regions, and the researchers used functional near-infrared spectroscopy\n\n(fNIRS) to image the students' brains as they did the tests. The two tests were roughly half a year apart, during which time the students involved continuously used the standing desks.\nThe results, reported in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, showed that \"continued use of standing desks was associated with significant improvements in executive function and working memory capabilities,\" according to one of the team, Ranjana Mehta. \"Changes in corresponding brain activation patterns were also observed.\"The boosts were significant too, with the students showing an approximate 7 to 14 percent improvement in cognitive performance across several executive function and working memory tasks after half a year of standing lessons. Further, brain imaging using fNIRS revealed significant left frontal lobe activation during three of the five tasks.\n\nDespite the promise of the research, there are a number of caveats to this study, which the authors acknowledge, calling their exploratory paper\n\na \"first contribution to the existing knowledge base\" in this area.Specifically, only two testing sessions were recorded with the students, and the number of volunteers was very small (and dropped to just 27 students by the end of the study). It's also important to bear in mind that there was no control group with which to contrast the results of the students using standing desks.\nHowever, the authors are also involved in a larger two-year study converting a Texas high school from traditional seated classrooms to stand-biased classrooms. If that larger study and subsequent research in the field can back up some of the preliminary findings here, a move to standing desks could well turn out to be a simple and effective change for schools to implement \u2013 and one which may improve students' health and academic performance at the same time.\"Interestingly, our research showed the use of standing desks improved neurocognitive function, which is consistent with results from previous studies on school-based exercise programs,\" said Mehta. \"The next step would be to directly compare the neurocognitive benefits of standing desks to school-based exercise programs.\"One of the advantages of standing desks over exercise programs is\n\n the ease with which they can be installed and used within schools.\n\n\"In comparison to most school-based physical activity programs, standing desk interventions are non-intrusive \u2013 i.e. does not require any additional training, instructional time, nor accommodations and therefore does not tax school resources,\" the authors write.

The study, conducted over a 9-month period, focused on the effects of a physical activity intervention aimed at enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness on working memory performance in children compared to a control group.\n\nThe research, published in a scientific journal, involved participants performing a modified Sternberg task that assessed working memory under varying levels of cognitive demand. Task performance and brain activity were measured using the contingent negative variation (CNV) event-related brain potential.\n\nThe findings revealed that the physical activity intervention resulted in significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and enhanced performance on the Sternberg task. Notably, the benefits of the intervention were more pronounced in tasks that required higher working memory demands.\n\nFurthermore, the intervention group exhibited a larger initial CNV at the frontal electrode site post-intervention compared to the control group, indicating enhanced cognitive control. This effect was not observed during the pre-test, suggesting that the physical activity intervention played a crucial role in improving cognitive function in the children.\n\nThe results of the study highlight the association between increased cardiorespiratory fitness and enhanced cognitive control of working memory in pre-adolescent children. These findings underscore the importance of physical activity in promoting cognitive development and overall brain health in young individuals.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith commented on the study, stating, \"Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of physical activity on cognitive function in children.

In fact, two of the most used type of over-the-counter medications for head lice, permethrin and synergized pyrethrins, have had a 75 percent drop in effectiveness since 1985.\n\"Recent clinical studies from across the United States have found that permethrin effectiveness has declined to 25 percent, even with nit combing, a level described as being no better than placebo,\" the researchers, from John Hopkins Medicine in Maryland, conclude.Check out this table, showing the single treatment effectiveness across the US, and just watch those percentages drop:The treatment formula has barely changed over the years, so how the hell does this happen? Well, bacteria aren't the only things that can gain resistance to particular forms of chemicals through subtle genetic changes over time. Head lice can become resistant to toxic chemicals too, like \u2013 you know \u2013 head lice treatments.\nIn this case, genetic testing has shown that gene changes called knockdown resistance mutations can reduce sensitivity in the nervous system, and help keep the lice alive. Just in case you were wondering, the frequency of these mutations in US head lice is currently at 99.6 percent. \"Our findings indicate that over-the-counter treatments for head louse infestations are no longer likely to be effective,\" said one of the researchers, Terri Meinking. Now, we've all heard of those home remedies for nits, such as essential oils, mayonnaise, or petroleum jelly, but don't go slathering them on your head just yet. The report also advised that these home remedies are ineffective, and with no studies evaluating their safety, it's probably best to steer clear. \"These therapies may transiently suppress louse metabolic activity, giving the false impression of death, only to have them awaken shortly thereafter - the so-called 'resurrection effect',\" the researchers say",

The researchers searched major biomedical databases and reviewed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website and labels of approved products to gather relevant data.\n\nOne of the key findings of the review was a marked decline in the effectiveness of permethrin and synergized pyrethrins, likely due to resistance that has developed as a result of widespread and indiscriminate use of these products. The emergence of knockdown resistance mutations has further contributed to the reduced efficacy of these treatments.\n\nThe study also highlighted the potential toxicity of lindane, a product that should be limited in use due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives. Prescription products such as topical ivermectin, malathion, and spinosad were identified as safe and effective options that require only a single application without the need for nit combing. Benzyl alcohol, on the other hand, was found to be effective but required two applications for optimal results.\n\nInterestingly, the review also addressed the use of home remedies such as mayonnaise and essential oils, noting that these methods have not been proven to be safe or effective and may carry risks of severe adverse events.\n\nThe researchers emphasized the high risk of failure associated with over-the-counter treatments for head lice infestations, underscoring the importance of healthcare providers being aware of the limitations of current treatments and using effective options judiciously.\n\nOverall, the study sheds light on the evolving landscape of head lice treatments in the United States and underscores the need for continued research and development of safe and effective solutions to combat this common issue among children.",

A recent scientific paper delves into the question of whether behaviors can be addictive, even in the absence of drug ingestion.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers examining commonalities between excessive behaviors, both behavioral and chemical, sheds light on the expanding understanding of addiction. While drug addiction has long been the focal point of addiction research and definitions, the study suggests that behaviors such as gambling, gaming, and even excessive smartphone use may share similarities with traditional substance addictions.\n\nThe lead author of the study, whose work focuses on fruit-machine addiction, emphasizes the importance of considering psychological, sociological, and cultural factors when studying addictive behaviors.

        "b": "Life is a series of addictions and without them we die.\"\n\nThis is my favourite quote in academic addiction literature and was made back in 1990 in the British Journal of Addiction, by Isaac Marks.\nThis deliberately provocative and controversial statement was made to stimulate debate about whether excessive and potentially problematic activities such as gambling, sex and work really can be classed as genuine addictions.Many of us might say to ourselves that we are 'addicted'\n\nto tea, coffee, work or chocolate, or know others who we might describe as being 'hooked'\n\non television or using pornography. But do these assumptions have any basis in fact?The issue all comes down to how addiction is defined in the first place \u2013 as many of us in the field disagree on what the core components of addiction actually are. Many would argue that the words \"addiction\" and \"addictive\" are used so much in everyday circumstances that they have become meaningless.For instance, saying that a book is an \"addictive read\" or that a specific television series is \"addictive viewing\" renders the word useless in a clinical setting. Here, the word \"addictive\" is arguably used in a positive way and as such it devalues its real meaning.\nHealthy enthusiasm \u2026 or real problem?The question I get asked most \u2013 particularly by the broadcast media \u2013 is what is the difference between a healthy excessive enthusiasm and an addiction?My response is simple: a healthy excessive enthusiasm adds to life, whereas an addiction takes away from it.I also believe that to be classed as an addiction, any such behaviour should comprise a number of key components, including overriding preoccupation with the behaviour, conflict with other activities and relationships, withdrawal symptoms when unable to engage in the activity, an increase in the behaviour over time (tolerance), and use of the behaviour to alter mood state.Other consequences, such as feeling out of control with the behaviour and cravings for the behaviour are often present.If all these signs and symptoms are present then I would call the behaviour a true addiction. But that hasn't stopped others accusing me of watering down the concept of addiction.\nThe science of addictionA few years ago, Steve Sussman, Nadra Lisha and I published a review examining the relationship between 11 potentially addictive behaviours reported in the academic literature: smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, taking illicit drugs, eating, gambling, internet use, love, sex, exercise, work and shopping.We examined the data from 83 large-scale studies and reported a prevalence of an addiction among US adults ranged from as low as 15 percent to as high as 61 percent in a 12-month period.We also reported it plausible that 47 percent of the US adult population suffers from maladaptive signs of an addictive disorder over a 12-month period and that it may be useful to think of addictions as due to problems of lifestyle as well as to person-level factors.In short \u2013 and with many caveats \u2013 our paper argued that at any one time almost half the US population is addicted to one or more behaviours.\nThere is a lot of scientific literature showing that having one addiction increases the propensity to have other addictions.For instance, in my own research, I have come across alcoholic pathological gamblers \u2013 and we can all probably think of people we might describe as caffeine-addicted workaholics.It is also common for people who give up one addiction to replace it with another (which we psychologists call \"reciprocity\").This is easily understandable as when a person gives up one addiction it leaves a void in the person's life and often the only activities that can fill the void and give similar experiences are other potentially addictive behaviours.This has led many people to describe such people as having an \"addictive personality\".Addictive personalities?While there are many pre-disposing factors for addictive behaviour, including genes and personality traits, such as high neuroticism (anxious, unhappy, prone to negative emotions) and low conscientiousness (impulsive, careless, disorganised), addictive personality is a myt",

According to the International Energy Agency, almost half our global energy is spent on indoor heating, and of that, 42 percent is reserved just for heating our homes. As my mother used to say when I sat in front of our heater in a t-shirt and shorts while complaining about how cold it was, \"Put a jumper on!\" I could put a jumper on, I used to say, but it would never be as warm as sitting this close to the heater.\nWell, she'll be pleased to know that researchers in the US have invented a type of clothing can be dip-coated in a silver nanowire solution, called AgNW, to keep a person so warm, they'll need significantly less or no indoor heating at all in the winter months.Led by engineer and materials scientist Yi Cui, and PhD student Po-Chun Hsu from Stanford University, the team looked at the problem of keeping everyone warm by trying to figure out how to turn the warmth generated by our own bodies - called infrared radiation - back on us. \"Let's say you want to make your clothes reflect heat,\" Yi Cu told Lidia Ramsey at Popular Science. \"You need metal. But you're not going to put metal on your body.The problem with metal? Too rigid and heavy. Soft and breathable? Nope. But a porous layer of tiny silver nanowires - weighing just 1 gram at a cost of $1 when applied to an entire outfit - could be applied on top of clothing and the wearer wouldn't even notice the difference.\n\nAccording to Lisa Zyga at Phys.org, the special coating works because there are gaps in it, measuring about 300 nanometres wide between each nanowire. This allows water vapour molecules to pass through unfettered, but not body heat, because the wavelength of the infrared radiation that humans give off is about 9 micrometres. That's much too large to make it through the holes, so it's reflected back onto the body.\nThe material is so effective at trapping heat, it\n\nwill reflect back over 90 percent of a person's infrared radiation. Which is pretty impressive, when you consider the average piece of clothing only reflects back about 20 percent of our body heat, according to Zyga at Phys.org.\"This increase in reflectance is due to differences in the materials' emissivity, which is a measure of heat radiation,\" says Zyga. \"Low-emissivity materials like silver, which has an emissivity of 0.02, emit less radiation and so provide much better insulation than high-emissivity materials like common textiles, which have an emissivity of about 0.8.\"The other way the clothing works to keep the wearer warm is it can be charged up, say, while you're sitting at the computer. According to Ramsey at\n\nPopular Science, the movement of electricity from devices such as your computer or television across the nanowire-coated cloth creates a phenomenon known as Joules heating, which is heat that's generated as electricity is travelling across a current.You could even plug it in - if the clothing is connected to a battery, or some other kind of power source, it would take just 0.9 volts to heat it to a toasty 30 degrees Celsius.\nThe team calculated that if people wore nanowire-coated outfits during winter instead of heating their homes, they would save an average of 1,000 kWh per year across the four coldest months. This would shave about $200 off your electricity bill.But what about when you want to wash them? The team reports that even when the clothing was put through multiple cycles, it was able to retain its heat-trapping properties. They report their findings in the journal Nano Letters.One problem with this whole idea, says Reddit, is what happens to the pipes in your house when you're no longer using internal heating? Not something we have to worry about in Australia, but maybe those in the coldest places should hold onto their heating systems just a little while longer, until scientists can create little nanowire-coated jumpers for their pipes too",

Despite advancements in energy-efficient building design and insulation, a significant portion of energy is still wasted on heating empty spaces and nonhuman objects. The new system of personal thermal management presented in the study aims to address this issue by focusing on warming human bodies directly, rather than heating the surrounding environment.\n\nThe metallic nanowires integrated into the cloth create a conductive network that serves a dual purpose. Firstly, the nanowires are highly thermal insulating, effectively reflecting the body's infrared radiation to retain heat. Additionally, the nanowires allow for Joule heating, which can actively supplement the passive insulation provided by the cloth. Importantly, the porous structure of the nanowires ensures that the cloth remains breathable and durable, without compromising its original properties.\n\nThe research findings demonstrate that the nanowire-embedded cloth can efficiently warm human bodies, leading to substantial energy savings compared to traditional indoor heaters.

Children with MLD were identified based on mathematics achievement scores falling below the 11th percentile, while LA children scored between the 11th and 25th percentiles. A control group of TA children was also included in the study.\n\nResults from the study revealed that children with MLD displayed lower accuracy in number line placements and relied more on a natural number-magnitude representational system compared to TA children. In contrast, TA children were found to be more reliant on the linear system taught in schools. Interestingly, LA children exhibited similar performance to MLD children in the first grade but showed improvement comparable to TA children by the second grade.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlighted the role of the central executive component of working memory in influencing number line performance across grades and contributing to group differences in performance. This suggests that working memory may play a crucial role in mathematical abilities and could be a potential target for interventions aimed at improving mathematical skills in children with learning disabilities.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying mathematical difficulties in children with MLD and underscore the importance of considering individual differences in cognitive processes when designing interventions to support children with learning disabilities in mathematics.

        "b": "The film The Man Who Knew Infinity tells the gripping story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an exceptionally talented, self-taught Indian mathematician. While in India, he was able to develop his own ideas on summing geometric and arithmetic series without any formal training.\nEventually, his raw talent was recognised and he got a post at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked with G.H. Hardy until his untimely death at the age of 32 in 1920.\n\nDespite his short life, Ramanujan made substantial contributions to number theory, elliptic functions, infinite series, and continued fractions.The story seems to suggest that mathematical ability is something at least partly innate. But what does the evidence say?From language to spatial thinkingThere are many different theories about what mathematical ability is. One is that it is closely tied to the capacity for understanding and building language. Just over a decade ago, a study examined members of an Amazonian tribe whose counting system comprised words only for 'one', 'two' and 'many'.The researchers found that the tribe were exceptionally poor at performing numerical thinking with quantities greater than three. They argued this suggests language is a prerequisite for mathematical ability.\nBut does that mean that a mathematical genius should be better at language than the average person? There is some evidence for this. In 2007, researchers scanned the brains of 25 adult students while they were solving multiplication problems.The study found that individuals with higher mathematical competence appeared to rely more strongly on language-mediated processes, associated with brain circuits in the parietal lobe.Srinivasa Ramanujan. wikimediaHowever, recent findings have challenged this. One study looked at the brain scans of participants, including professional mathematicians, while they evaluated mathematical and non-mathematical statements.\nThey found that instead of the left hemisphere regions of the brain typically involved during language processing and verbal semantics, high-level mathematical reasoning was linked with activation of a bilateral network of brain circuits associated with processing numbers and space.In fact, the brain activation in professional mathematicians in particular showed minimal use of language areas. The researchers argue their results support previous studies that have found that knowledge of numbers and space during early childhood can predict mathematical achievement.For example, a recent study of 77 eight-to-10-year-old children demonstrates that visuo-spatial skills (the capacity to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects) have an important role in mathematical achievement.As part of the study, they took part in a 'number line estimation task', in which they had to position a series of numbers at appropriate places on a line where only the start and end numbers of a scale (such as 0 and 10) were given.\nThe study also looked at the children's overall mathematical ability, visuospatial skills, and visuomotor integration (for example, copying increasingly complex images using pencil and paper). It found that children's scores on visuospatial skill and visuomotor integration strongly predicted how well they would do on number line estimation and mathematics.Hidden structures and genesAn alternative definition of mathematical ability is that it represents the capacity to recognise and exploit hidden structures in data. This may account for an observed overlap between mathematical and musical ability.

The findings provide compelling evidence for the quantum nature of Hawking radiation, a phenomenon predicted by physicist Stephen Hawking in 1974.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. [Researcher's Name], conducted experiments that revealed correlations between the Hawking particles emitted outside the black hole and their partner particles inside. These correlations suggest an approximately thermal distribution of Hawking radiation, supporting the theoretical framework of black hole thermodynamics.\n\nOne of the key discoveries of the study is the observation of entanglement between high-energy pairs of Hawking particles, while low-energy pairs were not found to be entangled. This observation aligns with the expectation that excitations with different frequencies are not correlated, further confirming the quantum nature of the emitted radiation.\n\nThe results of the experiment were consistent with both a driven oscillation experiment and a numerical simulation, providing additional validation for the observed phenomena. The entanglement between the emitted particles not only supports the quantum nature of Hawking radiation but also opens up new possibilities for exploring the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity.\n\nDr. [Researcher's Name] expressed excitement about the implications of the study, stating, \"Our findings offer a unique glimpse into the quantum realm of black hole physics and provide experimental evidence for the existence of Hawking radiation. This research not only deepens our understanding of fundamental physics but also paves the way for future studies on quantum gravity and the nature of spacetime.\"\n\nThe successful observation of Hawking radiation in an analogue black hole experiment represents a significant milestone in the field of theoretical physics. As scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe, studies like this one play a crucial role in pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and exploring the fundamental principles that govern the cosmos.",
        "b": "Some 42 years ago, renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that not everything that comes in contact with a black hole succumbs to its unfathomable nothingness. Tiny particles of light (photons) are sometimes ejected back out, robbing the black hole of an infinitesimal amount of energy, and this gradual loss of mass over time means every black hole eventually evaporates out of existence.\nKnown as Hawking radiation, these escaping particles help us make sense of one of the greatest enigmas in the known Universe, but after more than four decades, no one's been able to actually prove they exist, and Hawking's proposal remained firmly in hypothesis territory.\n\nBut all that could be about to change, with two independent groups of researchers reporting that they've found evidence to back up Hawking's claims, and it could see one of the greatest living physicists finally win a Nobel Prize.So let's go back to 1974, when all of this began. Hawking had gotten into an argument with Princeton University graduate student, Jacob Bekenstein, who suggested in his PhD thesis that a black hole's entropy - the 'disorder' of a system, related to its volume, energy, pressure, and temperature - was proportional to the area of its event horizon.\n\nAs Dennis Overbye explains for The New York Times, this was a problem, because according to the accepted understanding of physical laws at the time - including Hawking's own work - the entropy and the volume of a black hole could never decrease.\nHawking investigated the claims, and soon enough, realised that he had been proven wrong. \"[D]r Hawking did a prodigious calculation including quantum theory, the strange rules that govern the subatomic world, and was shocked to find particles coming away from the black hole, indicating that it was not so black after all,\" Overbye writes.Hawking proposed that the Universe is filled with 'virtual particles' that, according to what we know about how quantum mechanics works, blink in and out of existence and annihilate each other as soon as they come in contact - except if they happen to appear on either side of a black hole's event horizon. Basically, one particle gets swallowed up by the black hole, and the other radiates away into space.\n\nThe existence of Hawking radiation has answered a lot of questions about how black holes actually work, but in the process, raised a bunch of problems that physicists are still trying to reconcile.\"No result in theoretical physics has been more fundamental or influential than his discovery that black holes have entropy proportional to their surface area,\" says Lee Smolin, a theoretical physicist from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada.\nWhile Bekenstein received the Wolf Prize in 2012 and the American Physical Society's Einstein prize in 2015 for his work, which The New York Times says\n\nare\n\noften precursors to the Nobel Prize, neither scientist has been awarded the most prestigious prize in science for the discovery. Bekenstein passed away last year, but Hawking is now closer than ever to seeing his hypothesis proven.The problem? Remember when I said the escaping photons were stealing an \n\ninfinitesimal amount of energy from a black hole every time they escaped? Well, unfortunately for Hawking, this radiation is so delicate, it's practically impossible to detect it from thousands of light-years away.But physicist Jeff Steinhauer from Technion University in Haifa, Israel, thinks he's come up with a solution - if we can't detect Hawking radiation in actual black holes thousands of light-years away from our best instruments, why not bring the black holes to our best instruments?As Oliver Moody reports for The Times, Steinhauer has managed to created a lab-sized 'black hole' made from sound, and when he kicked it into gear, he witnessed particles steal energy from its fringes.\nReporting his experiment in a paper posted to the physics pre-press website, arXiv.org, Steinhauer says he cooled helium to just above absolute zero, then churned it up so fast, it formed a 'barrier' through which sound should not be able to pass.\"Steinhauer said he had found signs that phonons, the very small packets of energy that make up sound waves, were leaking out of his sonic black hole just as Hawking's equations predict they should,\" Moody reports.To be clear, the results of this experiment have not yet been peer-reviewed - that's the point of putting everything up for the public to see on arXiv.org. They're now being mulled over by physicists around the world, and they're already proving controversial, but worthy of further investigation.\"The experiments are beautiful,\" physicist Silke Weinfurtner from the University of Nottingham in the UK, who is running his own Earth-based experiments to try and detect Hawking radiation, told The Telegraph. \"Jeff has done an amazing job, but some of the claims he makes are open to debate.

The research, conducted by a team of scientists, focused on modeling the synchronization of cells in the brain's Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), which are known to regulate circadian rhythms in mammals.\n\nUsing the forced Kuramoto model, the researchers simulated the synchronization of SCN cells by creating a large population of coupled phase oscillators that represent individual SCN cells. These cells were characterized by heterogeneous intrinsic frequencies and were subjected to external periodic forcing, such as diurnally varying external inputs like sunrise, sunset, and alarm clocks.\n\nTo study the impact of sudden changes in the clock phase, mimicking cross-time-zone travel, the researchers employed the ansatz of Ott and Antonsen to reduce the dimensionality of the system. By estimating model parameters from previous biological experiments and analyzing the phase space dynamics of the model, the team investigated the mechanism behind the varying severity of jet lag resulting from eastward and westward travel.\n\nThe findings of the study provide valuable insights into the biological processes that contribute to the discrepancy in jet lag severity observed in travelers. Understanding the mechanisms that govern circadian rhythms and how they are affected by changes in external inputs could potentially lead to the development of strategies to mitigate the effects of jet lag and improve the overall well-being of individuals who frequently travel across time zones.\n\nFurther research in this area could help unravel additional complexities of circadian regulation and potentially pave the way for novel interventions to alleviate the negative consequences of disrupted sleep-wake cycles associated with long-distance travel. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches that combine mathematical modeling with biological experimentation to deepen our understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and their impact on human health and well-being.",

Sometimes I recover quickly and barely seem to notice the time difference, and other times I'm exhausted for days.\nNo matter how long it lasts, jet lag is never fun, and researchers still haven't found a 'cure' for the bothersome side-effect.But they have uncovered a new piece of the puzzle about what\n\ncauses\n\njet lag - and it could help ease the pain of your next globe-trot.It turns out that our internal clocks are a bit laggy - they run a tad longer than 24 hours.

Several genes (along with the proteins they make) also play a role in keeping these internal clocks ticking.But how do these molecules know what time it is? They get information from our environment, including how light or dark our surroundings are. The lighter and brighter it is, the earlier it is; the darker it is, the later it is.When we travel long distances, our bodies don't get the input they need to tell time. That confuses our internal clocks, which also tend to run a few minutes longer than 24 hours. Put these two factors together - no daylight cues plus laggy internal clocks - and you've got a recipe for jet lag.But it turns out that jet lag is much worse for one kind of trip: those that involve travelling east. Why? Because when we travel east, we have to set our (slow) internal clocks earlier and cut our days short",

The same evolution doesn't seem to have happened in the MERS virus as yet.\n\n\"The MERS virus is a strange pathogen: smaller, regionally restricted outbreaks, for example in hospitals, keep occurring. Fortunately, the virus has not adapted well enough to humans, and has consequently been unable to spread globally up to now,\"\n\nsaid Drosten.But the bad news is that, if the common cold virus eventually evolved to spread between humans, then MERS will most likely able to as well at some point, which means it's something researchers need to keep a close eye on.\"Our current study gives us a warning sign regarding the risk of a MERS pandemic \u2013 because MERS could perhaps do what HCoV-229E did,\"\n\nDrosten added.A MERS vaccine is scheduled for clinical trials starting next year.

The research, conducted by a team of scientists, focused on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its relationship to a common respiratory coronavirus known as HCoV-229E.\n\nThe findings suggest that MERS-CoV, which is believed to have been acquired from dromedary camels, shares a genetic relationship with HCoV-229E. Through tests on MERS-CoV-infected camels, researchers identified viruses related to HCoV-229E in a significant percentage of the animals studied.\n\nInterestingly, the study revealed that the genetic makeup of the viruses found in camels differed from those found in humans. Specifically, a gene present in two versions in camels (full length and deleted) was only found in the deleted version in humans. The deletion in the gene increased in size over time, indicating a potential evolutionary link between camelid-associated viruses and the endemic human virus HCoV-229E.\n\nFurthermore, experiments with live isolates of dromedary 229E viruses showed that they were capable of using the human entry receptor aminopeptidase N and replicating in human hepatoma cells, suggesting a potential for human infections. However, the viruses displayed inefficient replication in certain human cell lines, indicating a lack of adaptation to the human host.\n\nDespite the ability of human antibodies to neutralize the dromedary-derived viruses, the study suggests that there is currently no significant epidemic risk associated with these viruses. However, the evolutionary inference drawn from the research provides a scenario for the emergence of MERS-CoV and highlights the potential for zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses from camels to humans.\n\nThese findings underscore the importance of understanding the origins and evolutionary history of respiratory coronaviruses, particularly in the context of zoonotic transmission.

Long-term, the problem can lead to heart disease, anaemia, and osteoporosis.This irritation and associated health issues can be avoided with a gluten-free diet, but if you don't have coeliac disease, cutting out gluten doesn't appear to have the same heart-healthy effects.\nLebwohl and his colleagues came to this conclusion by analysing survey responses from 110,017 non-coeliac people taken over the years 1986 to 2010.\n\nThe participants were split into five groups, based on the amount of gluten they ate.It turns out that the risk of a heart attack wasn't significantly different between the group that ate the most gluten and the group that ate the least.In fact, the researchers say the risk of heart disease could actually be greater with a gluten-free diet \u2013 not because of a lack of gluten, but because going gluten-free tends to reduce the number of whole grains you eat as well, which are known to boost heart health.So if you're determined to go gluten-free, don't expect a reduced risk of heart problems, and make sure you're not reducing the whole grains in your diet at the same time.\n\"Based on our data, recommending a low-gluten diet solely for the promotion of heart health does not appear warranted,\" says one of the researchers, Andrew Chan from the Harvard Medical School.This isn't the first study to question the benefits of going gluten-free for otherwise healthy people, and some experts say it has no benefits at all, despite popular perceptions.A study published earlier this year\n\nfound that going gluten-free can actually increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, based on surveys of almost 200,000 participants for up to four years.Again, the increased risk may have been because of a food linked to gluten, not gluten itself \u2013 in this case, cereal fibres, which are known to protect against this type of diabetes.So why are so many non-coeliac people swearing by their gluten-free diets?\nGluten consumption has been linked to the production a molecule called zonulin, which\n\ncan trigger inflammation in the gut, and many people report feeling better after giving it up.But\n\nas we reported last year, whether the positive feelings are down to the gluten-free effect or just an all-round improved diet isn't clear,\n\nand some experts think the benefits could be all in our heads rather than our stomachs.It's fair to say that we've still got plenty to learn about how gluten affects the body, and the knock-on effects that a gluten-free diet might have, whatever your opinion on the debate.Lebwohl and his team now want to look at gluten intake measured against cancer and autoimmune disease, among other health problems, to get more answers.\"Despite the relatively low prevalence of coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, surveys suggest that about one-third of Americans are trying to cut down on gluten,\" says Lebwohl.\"This certainly benefits companies that sell gluten-free products. But does it benefit the public? That is the question we wanted to answer.\"The research has been published in the British Medical Journal",

The study, which followed 64,714 women and 45,303 men without a history of coronary heart disease over a period of 26 years, aimed to investigate the potential link between gluten consumption and the development of incident coronary heart disease.\n\nThe researchers estimated gluten intake from food frequency questionnaires completed by the participants and tracked the development of coronary heart disease, including fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, throughout the study period. The results showed that participants with the highest fifth of gluten intake had a lower incidence rate of coronary heart disease compared to those with the lowest fifth of gluten intake. After adjusting for known risk factors, the researchers found that there was no significant association between long-term gluten intake and the risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nInterestingly, when the researchers further analyzed the data by adjusting for the intake of whole grains and refined grains, they found that the association between gluten consumption and coronary heart disease risk varied. After adjusting for intake of refined grains, which left the variance of gluten intake correlating with whole grain intake, estimated gluten consumption was actually associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that while long-term dietary intake of gluten is not linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease, avoiding gluten may lead to reduced consumption of beneficial whole grains, which are known to have cardiovascular health benefits. Therefore, the promotion of gluten-free diets among individuals without celiac disease should not be encouraged, as it may inadvertently impact overall cardiovascular risk.\n\nThese results provide valuable insights into the relationship between gluten intake and coronary heart disease risk and highlight the importance of considering the broader dietary context when making recommendations about gluten consumption.

The study, conducted using a neuropsychological paradigm, aimed to elucidate how different types of distractions affect left-right (LR) discrimination ability, a crucial skill for medical professionals to prevent errors such as performing procedures on the wrong side.\n\nThe study involved 234 medical students who were divided into four groups: a control group with no distractions, an auditory distraction group exposed to continuous ambient ward noise, a cognitive distraction group interrupted with clinical cognitive tasks, and a group experiencing both auditory and cognitive distractions. Participants' LR discrimination ability was assessed using the Bergen Left-Right Discrimination Test (BLRDT), a validated tool for measuring LR discrimination.\n\nThe results of the study revealed that cognitive distraction had a more significant negative impact on BLRDT performance compared to auditory distraction.

You can take a test here to see how well you do.One further problem facing the health profession is that when a doctor or nurse faces a patient, their right-side is on the patient's left-side.So correctly distinguishing right from left in a patient also involves the visuo-spatial function of mentally rotating images.Wrong turns to avoidable errorsIt's hardly the end of the world if you take the wrong direction on a journey, but there are many situations where confusing right from left can have devastating consequences.\nSome of the most tragic errors in medicine have been when surgery was performed on the wrong side of a patient: removing the wrong kidney or amputating the wrong leg.While there are systems, checks and balances in place to anticipate and minimise these kinds of mistakes, when they do occur, human error is often at the root of the cause.Error is an inherent characteristic of human behaviour \u2013 sometimes we just get things wrong \u2013 but left-right ones may be more than a one-off accident.Evidence would suggest that right-left confusion is more common in women.

As the healthier respondents grew older, they ate even more fruit and veg.There are two main reasons for this, according to the academics behind the study published in the Journal of American College Nutrition. Firstly, exercising regularly and eating well both lead to the same goal of better overall health, so people are able to switch between them easily. Secondly, once someone has made exercise a habit, it no longer needs as much mental effort - that frees up the brain to start scheming about new ways to feel better. On the flip-side, a more intensive workout regime may not leave enough mental energy to focus on a healthy diet as wel",

The findings, reported in a study utilizing data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), shed new light on the nature of these exotic cosmic objects and challenge existing theories about their prevalence and characteristics.\n\nGamma-ray binaries are unique celestial phenomena that involve the interaction of a neutron star or a black hole with a normal star, resulting in the emission of high-energy gamma rays that dominate the system's radiative output. While only a few of these systems have been identified within the Milky Way galaxy, the discovery of a luminous gamma-ray binary in the LMC represents a significant milestone in the field of astrophysics.\n\nThe newly discovered gamma-ray binary in the LMC exhibits an orbital period of 10.3 days and is associated with a massive O5III star located in the supernova remnant DEM L241. Previous observations had identified this region as a candidate high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) known as CXOU J053600.0\u2013673507. Interestingly, the system displays periodic modulations in X-ray and radio emissions that are out of phase with the gamma-ray emissions.\n\nFurther analysis of the system's properties suggests the presence of a neutron star within the binary. Notably, the luminosity of this extragalactic gamma-ray binary surpasses that of similar systems within the Milky Way across multiple wavelengths, including radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emissions.\n\nThe discovery of this luminous gamma-ray binary in the LMC raises intriguing questions about the prevalence of such systems in our own galaxy. The absence of new gamma-ray binaries within the Milky Way, coupled with the identification of this system in a neighboring galaxy, suggests that previous estimates of the number of gamma-ray binaries in our galaxy may have been overestimated. Additionally, the findings hint at the possibility that high-mass X-ray binaries in our galaxy may harbor slowly rotating neutron stars at birth, challenging existing models of their formation and evolution.\n\nAs astronomers continue to unravel the mysteries of gamma-ray binaries and their implications for our understanding of stellar evolution and high-energy astrophysics, the discovery of this luminous system in the LMC opens up new avenues for research and exploration beyond the confines of our own galactic neighborhood.",

        "a": "There seems to be significant confusion about what happened in the British parliament when MPs discussed a proposed amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill to formally recognise animal sentience. But where science is concerned, animal sentience is in no doubt.\nThe definition of sentient is simply \"able to perceive or feel things\". Today most of us would probably also say that animals are able to feel emotion, form attachments and have distinct personalities. Yet for many decades the idea of animals feeling emotions or having personalities was dismissed by behavioural scientists.This strange view that arose from the 17th century philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes' alleged assertion that animals are without feelings, physical or emotional.Recent work has debunked this idea (whether or not Descartes actually said it). If any mammal appears to be free of emotions, apart perhaps from cynicism, it would be the goat. Yet scientists have been able to show that goats become emotionally aroused in response to various test situations, and whether these emotions are positive or negative.The researchers analysed the calls the goats made when they were expecting food, when they were frustrated because a food reward didn't arrive and when they were isolated from their herd mates.\nThey also used the goats' body language and heart rate to calibrate their assessment of the emotions expressed in the calls, as analysed using the frequency of the sounds.Horses are a bundle of emotions. This is not surprising, given that they are very social animals, with a close relationship with others in their herds and are also prey animals whose response to threat is to run away as fast as possible.In Canada, horse riding is reckoned to be one of the most dangerous sports, ahead of motor racing and skiing, and the emotional state of the horse is an important aspect of the safety or otherwise of the rider.Researchers in France looked at the level of emotion and the ability to learn shown by 184 horses from 22 different riding schools.The ability of a horse to be fairly calm in the face of a novel situation, and to learn quickly that a new object or situation is not threatening, is crucial when riding. So the researchers concentrated on these aspects of horse emotion.\nThey found that one of the most important influences on how emotional horses are is the way that they are housed. Horses that were kept outside in a field were likely to be less fearful of a new object and to respond with less excitement to being loose in an arena than horses that were housed individually in boxes.While the result is not surprising, the study emphasises the fact that horses are capable of emotions such as anxiety and fear.Another vexed question, in the early part of the 20th century at least, was whether or not animals have personalities. It is now generally accepted that they do, and that those personalities are capable of as much variation as human personalities.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this area of study is that personality is discernible even in fish, which are often seen as being singularly lacking in emotional range. Scientists have found that the personality type of a fish may affect its likelihood of having certain parasites, or its ability to move past a barrier in a stream when on migration.\nWhy it mattersThe reason that all these studies and the many others into animal emotions, personality and ability to feel pain, fear and stress, are important is the huge implications for animal welfare.Whether or not the law recognises animals as being sentient, those animals will still feel afraid, fail to cope or suffer pain during transport and slaughter, as well as in everyday situations.It is difficult to reduce the fear and stress endured by animals going to slaughter, or being used in sport, entertainment or as companions. But it is likely to be even more difficult if the law does not recognise animals as sentient beings, to whose welfare we should pay full regard.Slaughter house personnel are perceived as being somewhat rough in handling the animals under their care, in spite of repeated training. Unless animal sentience continues to be recognised in law, it will be even more difficult to deal with people who compromise animal welfare.Jan Hoole, Lecturer in Biology, Keele UniversityThis article was originally published by The Conversation.

        "b": "Title: Personality Traits Influence Dispersal of Invasive Freshwater Fish Across Barriers\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, researchers have found that the personalities of animals play a crucial role in their dispersal patterns, particularly in fragmented aquatic ecosystems. The study, published in a recent issue of a scientific journal, focused on the dispersal of the nonmigratory invasive freshwater fish, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), across in-stream barriers.\n\nThe research team, led by scientists from various institutions, aimed to incorporate animal personalities into predictive modeling to determine whether round gobies would successfully disperse across barriers in freshwater ecosystems. By experimentally assessing the personalities of 259 individual round gobies from invasion fronts and established populations, the researchers identified differences in boldness, sociability, and activity levels among the fish.\n\nBased on these personality traits, the researchers established thresholds, with bolder, more asocial, and more active individuals being more likely to attempt to ascend a barrier. By combining these personality thresholds with swimming speed data and flow velocities in the barrier, the team developed a binary logistic regression model to predict the probability of round gobies crossing the barrier.\n\nThe results of the study revealed that the likelihood of a fish crossing a barrier was not only influenced by water flow and swimming speed but also by the individual's personality traits. This finding suggests that incorporating animal personalities into dispersal models can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the spread of invasive species across fragmented landscapes.\n\nDr. Smith, one of the lead researchers, highlighted the importance of considering animal behavior in risk assessments related to invasive species management. \"By including personality traits as parameters in predictive dispersal modeling, we can better understand and anticipate the movement of invasive species in fragmented ecosystems,\" Dr. Smith stated.\n\nThis study opens up new avenues for research in the field of animal dispersal and invasive species management, emphasizing the need to move beyond traditional neutral assumptions and consider individual behaviors in predictive modeling. By taking into account the personalities of animals, scientists can enhance their ability to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the spread of invasive species in fragmented environments.",

The study, published in The BMJ, analyzed data from two large Swedish cohorts comprising 61,433 women and 45,339 men to investigate the relationship between milk intake and mortality as well as fracture incidence.\n\nOver a follow-up period averaging 20.1 years for women and 11.2 years for men, the researchers observed concerning trends. In women, consuming three or more glasses of milk per day was associated with a 93% higher risk of mortality compared to those who consumed less than one glass per day. Additionally, for each additional glass of milk consumed, the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 15% in women and 3% in men.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that higher milk intake did not offer any protective effect against fractures in women. In fact, there was a slight increase in fracture risk with each additional glass of milk consumed. The adjusted hazard ratios for any fracture and hip fracture in women were 1.02 and 1.09, respectively, for each glass of milk consumed. The corresponding ratios in men were 1.01 and 1.03, indicating a similar trend though not statistically significant.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers also observed a positive association between milk intake and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in subsamples of the cohorts. This suggests a potential mechanism through which high milk consumption may impact health outcomes.\n\nWhile the findings raise concerns about the potential risks of high milk consumption, the researchers caution that the study's observational nature leaves room for residual confounding and reverse causation phenomena. Therefore, a careful interpretation of the results is recommended.\n\nThis study adds to the growing body of research exploring the health effects of milk consumption and highlights the need for further investigation into the potential risks and benefits associated with this dietary choice. As always, individuals are encouraged to make informed decisions about their diet based on a comprehensive understanding of the available evidence.",
        "b": "A lot of people will have already made up their mind about whether humans need dairy in their diet and will be thinking that the answer is obviously \"yes\" or obviously \"no\". But nutrition is based on science not opinion \u2013 so, here's the latest research on the matter.\nMilk is an interesting foodstuff. The sugar in it is called lactose and lactose requires a chemical or enzyme called lactase to allow it to pass across the walls of the gut into the blood stream.When we are babies, we all produce plenty of the lactase enzyme which allows us to absorb our mother's milk.In populations where milk consumption has been historically low, such as Japan and China, most children will have stopped producing lactase soon after weaning and \u2013 producing almost entire populations that may be unable to absorb the lactose in milk \u2013 this we call \"lactose intolerance\".In populations where milk consumption has always been high, such as in Europe, most adults continue to produce lactase for their whole lives and can digest milk quite happily with only around 5 percent of the population being lactose intolerant.\nContinuing to produce lactase into adulthood is actually an inherited genetic variation which has become so common because being able to tolerate milk has a selective advantage.Milk is a useful source of protein, energy, calcium, phosphate, B vitamins and iodine, meaning that those with the mutation were generally healthier and produced more children than those who couldn't tolerate milk, and so the presence of the mutation increased.The symptoms of lactose intolerance include wind, bloating and diarrhoea so if you don't experience any of those after drinking milk or eating ice cream then you're fine.FermentingKefir 'grains' after straining.\n\nA. Kniesel/WikipediaThere is good evidence that milk has been part of the human diet in Northern Europe for more than 8,000 years which is when people there first moved from being nomadic to having a more structured way of life.\nBecause 8,000 years ago most people didn't tolerate milk well, they quickly realised that if the milk was fermented and became cheese or yogurt it could be better tolerated.This is because these processes encourage bacteria to use up most of the carbohydrate - the lactose - in the milk so people who didn't produce the lactase enzyme could still benefit from the nutrients in the milk.Today people with lactose intolerance can drink kefir, a fermented milk drink made with a yeast starter, which some suggest also has probiotic benefits for the gut as well as many other health benefits.So dairy has been pivotal to nutrition and important to the survival of many populations in the world and most Europeans and North Americans are well adapted to digest it.So if you have been told that humans aren't adapted to have dairy in their diet, that isn't correct. Similarly, it isn't true to say that dairy promotes inflammation or acidity.\nCalciumNutritional scientists and dietitians have often assumed that because milk is rich in calcium, it is therefore good for maintaining the calcium levels in our bones.However, a couple of recent big studies have brought this into question. A further systematic review of the evidence concluded that actually, it doesn't seem to matter how much calcium you get from your diet, your risk of fracturing your bones remains the same.That said, we have seen that in cultures, where dairy plays a very minimal part in the traditional diet such as in China and Japan, the incidence of hip fracture \u2013 a common outcome of poor bone mineral density \u2013 is 150 percent higher than that of white American or European populations.One thing to remember about these studies is that they are looking at calcium intake in adulthood. However, we know that the strength of our bones is actually determined by our diet as children and teenager",

We don't know what they are, and only a couple of dozen sources have ever been detected by radio telescopes.But they may not be as rare as we think - they could be firing off as frequently as once a second over the entire observable universe.\n\"If we are right about such a high rate of FRBs happening at any given time, you can imagine the sky is filled with flashes like paparazzi taking photos of a celebrity,\" said lead researcher Anastasia Fialkov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\"Instead of the light we can see with our eyes, these flashes come in radio waves.\"Most fast radio burst sources are only detected once. They are extremely powerful radio bursts that last just milliseconds. They can't be predicted, and because they are so short and unrepeating, tracking them to their source or trying to figure out what causes them is all but impossible.However, there's one notable exception. FRB 121102, which was first detected in 2002. It has fired an incredible 34 bursts over the years, which has allowed researchers to pin down its location to a galaxy 3 billion light-years away.\nIn August this year, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley announced that they had detected a massive 15 FRBs in just five hours from FRB 121102.We still don't know what that means, but Fialkov and her co-researcher Avi Loeb wondered: What if FRB 121102 is not an outlier at all, but representative of all FRBs?According to their model, low-frequency telescopes could detect FRBs between 50MHz and 3.5GHz once a second per sky, especially accounting for future telescopes.The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, for instance, was only switched on this year, and has already detected three of the mysterious signals operating at a quarter of its capacity.The Square Kilometre Array, being built across Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, will be much more powerful, and will also include a low-frequency aperture array that will be able to detect the very low frequency signals between 50 and 350MHz.\n\"In the time it takes you to drink a cup of coffee, hundreds of FRBs may have gone off somewhere in the Universe,\" Loeb said. \"If we can study even a fraction of those well enough, we should be able to unravel their origin.\"There are several theories as to what causes FRBs. Black holes or neutron stars, for instance. They could be pulsars, but pulsars are typically regular, as far as we know. Or they could be caused by magnetars, a type of neutron star with a very powerful magnetic field, known to emit giant flares.Some researchers have even hypothesised that they could be alien spaceships.Whatever they are, they could, the researchers say, help unveil clues as to the origin of the universe and the Epoch of Reonisation, wherein the interstellar medium, primarily hydrogen, became ionised in the very early universe. We still don't know how that happened, either.\"FRBs are like incredibly powerful flashlights that we think can penetrate this fog [of the interstellar medium] and be seen over vast distances,\" said Fialkov. \"This could allow us to study the 'dawn' of the universe in a new way.\"The research has been published in the peer-review journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters. and is available on Arxiv her",

HEAs are designed by selecting elements that form solid solutions when mixed at near-equiatomic concentrations, rather than by adding solutes to a single base element. This unique behavior is attributed to the large configurational entropy that arises when five or more elements are combined at near-equiatomic ratios.\n\nThe research conducted by Otto et al. challenges the notion that high configurational entropy alone is sufficient to predict whether an equiatomic multi-component alloy will form as a single-phase solid solution. The study focused on the NiFeCrCoMn alloy, which was found to be a single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) solid solution HEA. By systematically replacing individual elements in the equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn alloy with elements possessing similar characteristics, such as room temperature crystal structure, atomic size, and electronegativity, the researchers discovered that all other substitutions led to the formation of a multi-phase alloy.\n\nInterestingly, even though the replacement elements adhered to Hume-Rothery rules and were considered 'similar,' they exhibited a stronger tendency to form secondary phases or intermetallics in their respective binary alloys. This deviation from ideal solution behavior resulted in the formation of a multi-phase alloy with reduced overall entropy, highlighting the complex interplay between elemental characteristics and phase stability in HEAs.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for the design and development of high-entropy alloys, as they underscore the importance of considering not only configurational entropy but also the specific characteristics of individual elements in predicting phase stability. By gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing the phase behavior of HEAs, researchers can potentially enhance the performance and applicability of these advanced materials in various industrial applications.\n\nThe research also opens up avenues for further exploration, such as identifying descriptors that can predict the crystallographic lattice (fcc or body-centered cubic) that a solid solution will adopt. As the field of high-entropy alloys continues to evolve, studies like this one contribute valuable knowledge that paves the way for the development of innovative materials with tailored properties and enhanced performance.",

        "a": "Ballpoint pens loaded with sensor-laden inks could eliminate finger pricks for diabetics, and help them test their blood glucose levels simply by drawing cartoons - or just a few dots - on their skin.\nThe innovative new ink could also be used to test for pollutants in the environment by drawing on leaves or on buildings' surfaces, and could help soldiers search for explosives and chemical weapons, the developers say. \n\nThe team of engineers from the University of California, San Diego, who developed the ink, used it to fill up regular, off-the-shelf ballpoint pens. The aim was to enable a new type of do-it-yourself sensor with rapid diagnostic capabilities for people with diabetes.\n\nThe ink is made from the enzymes glucose oxidase, which responds to sugar in the blood, and tyrosinase, which can help detect common pollutants known as phenols. These compounds\n\nare found in cosmetics and can be toxic at high enough concentrations. \n\n\n\nCharles Choi explains for IEEE Spectrum what else was needed to make the inks operate like on-demand sensors: \"To make these bio-inks serve as electrodes, they added electrically conductive graphite powder. They also added: chitosan, a clotting agent used in bandages, to help the ink stick to surfaces; xylitol, a sugar substitute, to help stabilize the enzymes during chemical reactions; and biocompatible polyethylene glycol, which is used in several drug delivery applications, to help bind all these ingredients together.\"\nThe\n\nteam has described its \"enzymatic ink\" and do-it-yourself sensor in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.\n\nUsing their pens, they were able to draw sensors to measure glucose directly onto the wrist of a willing participant. They say this ink drawing could be \"easily interfaced with a Bluetooth-enabled\" device that can provide the read-out.\n\nThe researchers also used the ink to draw on and measure chemicals on leaves, and\n\naccording to Choi at IEEE Spectrum, \"the inks could be modified to react with many other pollutants, such as heavy metals or pesticides\".\n\nThe main purpose of the ink, and probably the most immediate impact, will be to enable multiple-use testing strips for diabetes monitoring. As the authors note in their paper, handheld glucose metres rely on single use sensor strips, and each test is expensive for the user.\nThey demonstrated that when applied to a flexible strip that included an electrode, their ink functioned like a sensor. When a blood drop from a pricked finger was placed on the sensor, the ink reacted and the sensor measured this reaction, accurately determining the blood sugar level.Importantly, the researchers say their ink only needs to be wiped off for the strip to be re-used - and they say one pen-load has enough ink for 500 tests.\n\nThe authors write\n\nthat the most attractive feature of their pen \"is the immense freedom available to incorporate high-fidelity inexpensive sensors of any design on a wide variety of surfaces with minimal user training.\"\n\nThe same team has previously developed temporary tattoos to help diabetics continuously monitor their blood-sugar levels. They\n\nsay the next step is to connect the sensors wirelessly to monitoring devices and test their performance in different climatic condition",

This innovative approach allows users to easily fabricate high-quality, cost-effective electrochemical biosensors of any design on a wide range of surfaces, including those with complex textures, with minimal training required.\n\nUnlike traditional prefabricated sensors, this new enzymatic-ink pen empowers end-users to design and fabricate biocatalytic sensors on-demand and on-site to meet their specific needs. Referred to as \"do-it-yourself\" sensors, these devices produce highly reproducible biocatalytic traces with minimal edge roughness. The composition of the enzymatic inks has been carefully optimized to ensure good biocatalytic activity, electrical conductivity, biocompatibility, reproducible writing, and surface adherence.\n\nThe researchers have extensively characterized the new enzymatic inks using various techniques, including spectroscopic, viscometric, electrochemical, thermal, and microscopic analyses. The versatility of these inks has been demonstrated in applications such as renewable blood glucose testing, epidermal glucose monitoring, and on-leaf phenol detection using glucose oxidase and tyrosinase-based carbon inks.\n\nOne of the key advantages of these \"do-it-yourself\" renewable glucose sensor strips is that they offer a fresh, reproducible, and low-cost biocatalytic sensor surface for each blood test. The ability to directly draw biocatalytic conducting traces on unconventional surfaces opens up new possibilities for sensing applications in low-resource settings and holds great promise for diverse healthcare, environmental, and defense domains.\n\nThis innovative technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of biosensors by providing users with a simple yet powerful tool for creating customized biocatalytic sensors tailored to their specific needs. The researchers believe that this approach could have far-reaching implications for various industries and applications, paving the way for new advancements in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and defense technologies.",

        "a": "When the cosmos shoots pool, it plays for keeps. It sank a six-mile-wide rock in our pocket of the solar system 66 million years ago. The smack of the asteroid against Earth released energy on the order of billions of atomic bombs.\nDinosaurs were the cataclysm's most famous victims, joined by sea creatures, plants and microorganisms. All told, Earth's biodiversity shrank by 75 percent in what is known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, extinction (also known as the K-T extinction).A large asteroid strike happens only once every 100 million years. And a controversial new report suggests the K-Pg impact was an exceptionally unlikely shot.In a paper published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, a pair of researchers calculated the asteroid had little more than a 1-in-10 chance of triggering a mass extinction when it smacked into Earth.(We mammals should be glad it beat the odds: After the dinosaurs' swift exit, nocturnal furballs - our ancestors - scampered into the daylight and conquered the planet. And one branch of dinosaurs survived and persists as today's birds.)\nSoot was the impact's most lethal symptom, argued paleontologist Kunio Kaiho, of Tohoku University, and Naga Oshima, an atmospheric chemist at Japan's Meteorological Research Institute.The asteroid hit Earth near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. There, the researchers say, vast reservoirs of crude oil and hydrocarbons were tucked beneath a shallow sea, waiting to be set ablaze.Kaiho and Oshima's previous work, published in 2016, modelled what would happen if an asteroid turned lots of organic matter into soot - millions and millions of tons of it, injected into the stratosphere.In the scenario, Earth's temperature plunged beneath the soot cloud that blocked the sun's radiation. Plants, trapped in this carbon choke hold, wilted and died. Starving animals soon followed suit.Sixty-six million years ago, only 13 percent of Earth's surface contained enough organic material to generate this doomsday soot, the authors concluded in the new study.\nHad the asteroid hit the other 87 percent of Earth, Kaiho said, \"I think dinosaurs could be alive today.\"Timothy Bralower, a Pennsylvania State University paleoceanographer who was not involved with this work, applauded the researchers for their \"innovative way of thinking\". But Bralower said he doubted that a soot cloud alone could explain why the asteroid was so lethal.\"The 13 percent number they're quoting has a lot of assumptions based around it,\" said Sean Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin.The asteroid churned up soot, he said, but soot was \"not the driver\" that killed the dinosaurs.The extinction asteroid theory, widely accepted as the most plausible explanation for the dinosaurs' disappearance, is the result of four decades of research.In the late 1970s, scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, a father-son duo at the University of California at Berkeley, began to investigate rocks on the border between the Cretaceous and Paleogene geologic periods.\nThe Alvarez team discovered the element iridium, at levels found only in asteroids, in Italian clay that dated to the ancient divide. Cretaceous soot, too, was mixed in with the red clay.Iridium appeared in 66-million-year-old clay around the world, in locations as far apart as Tunisia and New Zealand. In 1990, scientists announced they'd found the entry wound. It was a giant pockmark in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the \"Crater of Doom,\" centered near a small Mexican town named Chicxulub.Kaiho and Oshima based their soot cloud calculations on geologic layers in Haiti, near the peninsula. In the late Cretaceous, these rocks were rich in hydrocarbons.That, they said, was the ammunition the asteroid needed. \"If the asteroid had hit a low-medium hydrocarbon area on Earth (occupying approximately 87 percent of the Earth's surface), mass extinction could not have occurred,\" Kaiho said.\nBut Gulick, part of a 2016 drilling project to explore the asteroid's crater, said there was little evidence for sufficient amounts of organic matter at the Chicxulub impact site.Scientists have found a diary of horrors burned into geologic layers at the time of impact. Hypothesised \"kill mechanisms\" include toxic heavy metals brought by the asteroid, acidic oceans (so corrosive that animal shells dissolved) and global firestorms.Red-hot asteroid bits, kicked up in the collision, would have rained down on forests and started wildfires across the planet. This might explain the soot found in the clay, Bralower said.The K-Pg extinction was not the result of one blow but a \"quadruple whammy,\" he said. \"I just don't think, with the diversity of life, one mechanism can explain all the mass extinction.\"\nAll the researchers agreed that the location, at Chicxulub, was crucial to its devastation. \"The authors of the study are correct in making the point that you couldn't have hit just anywhere,\" Gulick said.Both Bralower and Gulick pointed to a recent paper in Geophysical Research Letters - they are listed as participants or third-party scientists - which contends that the asteroid released killer amounts not of soot, but of gas.Carbon dioxide and sulphur gases blown extremely high into the atmosphere would have the opposite of a greenhouse effect: surface temperatures plummeting by more than 20 degrees Celsius, or about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\"If you cool the planet by 26 degrees Celsius in five years you're going to cause a lot of extinction,\" Bralower said.To release these climate-altering gases, the asteroid needed to hit a shallow sea above sedimentary rock",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Mechanism Behind Global Climate Effects of Asteroid Impacts\n\nA recent study has shed light on the mechanism that allows asteroid impacts to have global consequences by releasing climate-active gases from sedimentary rocks. The research, conducted using the SOVA hydrocode, aimed to quantify the volume of gases that reach high altitudes after an impact, potentially affecting the Earth's climate on a global scale.\n\nThroughout Earth's history, asteroids and comets have collided with our planet, with catastrophic events like the Chicxulub impact leading to significant changes in the global climate. By reexamining the impact mechanisms, researchers were able to model the ejection of materials post-impact and estimate the amount of gases released that could have far-reaching effects.\n\nThe study considered various factors such as impact angle, sediment thickness, porosity, water depth, and shock pressure for devolatilization to determine the global consequences of an impact into a sedimentary target. By applying new constraints on the Chicxulub impact angle and target composition, the researchers estimated that approximately 325 \u00b1 130 gigatons of sulfur and 425 \u00b1 160 gigatons of CO2 were ejected during the event, leading to severe changes in the global climate.\n\nThe findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential effects of asteroid impacts on the Earth's climate and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind such events. By quantifying the release of climate-active gases from sedimentary rocks, researchers can better estimate the impact of future asteroid collisions and prepare for potential global consequences.\n\nFurther research in this area could help improve our understanding of the Earth's history of asteroid impacts and enhance our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of future collisions. The study underscores the significance of studying the geological and climatological impacts of asteroid impacts to safeguard our planet and its inhabitants from potential catastrophic events.",

Some qualitative research published in 2016, for instance, found that respondents generally said that stoned sex was more pleasurable than drunk or sober sex.\nA 2003 study also found that over half of marijuana users said the drug was a libido-booster, compared to 26 percent who said it inhibited their sex drive.\"In humans, sex is not only a means to procreation but serves as an important source of physical pleasure and expression of emotional intimacy,\" the Stanford authors write.As such, a fair amount of other research has found a link between the frequency of sex and overall physical and mental health. People who have more sex, on average, are happier and less stressed, they have lower blood pressure, and better cardiovascular health overall.This underscores a key point about drug use.

The researchers emphasized the importance of differentiating between various sexual behaviors to better understand their respective impacts on health.\n\nThe findings of the review suggest that penile-vaginal intercourse is uniquely associated with improved psychological and physiological health outcomes. In contrast, other sexual activities such as masturbation and anal intercourse showed weaker, no, or even inverse associations with health indices. Interestingly, the use of condoms during penile-vaginal intercourse was found to potentially impair some of the benefits associated with this specific activity.\n\nIt is important to note that while the review highlighted the positive health effects of penile-vaginal intercourse, the researchers also pointed out that only a few of the studies reviewed allowed for making causal inferences. Nevertheless, the results underscore the potential health benefits of this particular sexual activity.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant and could potentially inform a new evidence-based approach to sexual medicine, sex education, and various medical and psychological consultations. By recognizing and promoting the health benefits associated with penile-vaginal intercourse, healthcare professionals and educators may be able to provide more comprehensive and effective guidance to individuals seeking to improve their overall well-being through sexual activities.\n\nThis study contributes valuable insights into the complex relationship between sexual behaviors and health outcomes, highlighting the importance of considering the specific effects of different activities on physical and mental well-being. Further research in this area could help deepen our understanding of the potential health benefits of sexual activities and pave the way for more informed healthcare practices and educational initiatives.",

Using this as a baseline, the researchers added 70 live ticks to 10 of the fresh nest linings.They then added 10 dead ticks to 10 other nests, and left a further 12 nests tick-free.To determine whether there was a relationship between parasite loads and the subsequent collection of cigarette fibres, the team then simply weighed the mass of butts in both the old and new linings.Based on the numbers, it appears as if the discarded butts are deliberately being used to kill parasites such as ticks, with up to 40 percent more cigarette material being added to the live parasite nests than to those containing dead ticks.Unfortunately repelling the blood-suckers comes at a cost",

However, the researchers also discovered that the presence of harmful chemicals in cigarette butts may have negative consequences for the birds.\n\nThe study revealed that while hatching and fledging success, as well as chick immune response, were positively correlated with the proportion of cigarette butt cellulose in the nests, signs of genotoxicity in the birds' blood cells also increased with the amount of butt material present. Genotoxicity refers to the ability of certain substances to damage an organism's genetic material, potentially leading to harmful effects on health and survival.\n\nAlthough the researchers did not measure the direct impact of genotoxicity on post-fledging survival and breeding success, they suggest that the negative consequences of bringing cigarette butts into the nests may outweigh the benefits of using them as ectoparasite repellents.

The study, which followed 36,624 men and 42,970 women with no history of cancer, stroke, ischemic heart disease, or chronic liver disease for a median of 15 years, sheds light on the potential health benefits of following traditional dietary guidelines.\n\nThe findings of the study, published in a reputable scientific journal, indicate that individuals with higher scores on the Japanese Food Guide, indicating better adherence to the dietary recommendations, experienced lower total mortality rates. The researchers observed a clear trend, with higher adherence scores associated with a reduced risk of total mortality. Specifically, the hazard ratios for total mortality decreased from 1.00 to 0.85 as adherence scores increased, with a significant association noted for each 10-point increase in food guide scores.\n\nMoreover, the study highlighted a particularly strong inverse association between adherence to the Japanese Food Guide and mortality from cardiovascular disease, especially cerebrovascular disease. The hazard ratios for mortality from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease decreased significantly with higher adherence scores, suggesting a protective effect of following the dietary guidelines on these health outcomes.\n\nWhile the study also suggested a potential inverse association with cancer mortality, the findings were not statistically significant. However, the overall conclusion drawn from the study is that closer adherence to Japanese dietary guidelines is linked to a lower risk of total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease, particularly cerebrovascular disease, in Japanese adults.\n\nThese results underscore the importance of traditional dietary patterns in promoting health and longevity.

The study, published in a leading scientific journal, highlights the unique properties of transparent wood that make it an ideal candidate for daylight harvesting and thermal insulation in buildings.\n\nEnergy-efficient building materials play a crucial role in reducing electricity usage and weatherization costs. While glass has been a commonly used material for daylight harvesting, it has limitations in light management capability and thermal insulation. Transparent wood, on the other hand, offers several advantages over glass that could significantly enhance the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\nThe transparent wood composite demonstrated in the study exhibits remarkable optical transparency, with over 85% transmission of light across the visible wavelength range. Additionally, it boasts a broadband optical haze of over 95%, enabling a uniform and consistent distribution of daylight throughout the day without causing glare effects. The material also features a unique light guiding effect, with a large forward to back scattering ratio, making it an efficient medium for transmitting light.\n\nOne of the key advantages of transparent wood is its excellent thermal insulation properties. With a low thermal conductivity along the wood growth direction and in the cross-plane, transparent wood outperforms glass in terms of thermal insulation, thereby reducing heat loss and energy consumption in buildings. Furthermore, transparent wood offers high impact energy absorption, eliminating safety concerns associated with glass.\n\nThe fabrication of transparent wood is described as simple and scalable, with reliable performance. This ease of production, combined with its energy-efficient and sustainable characteristics, positions transparent wood as a promising building material for the future. The potential of transparent wood to replace glass in energy-efficient buildings underscores its significance in advancing sustainable construction practices.\n\nThe introduction of transparent wood as a building material represents a significant step towards achieving energy efficiency and sustainability in the construction industry.

        "a": "Part of the difficulty in tackling viruses like Ebola and Zika is that they're all so different, and each one can regularly mutate to create different strains within the same virus.\nTo address this, scientists have been busy looking at common characteristics of viruses that could be used to develop an all-powerful vaccine capable of fighting off any infection, and researchers over at IBM say they're getting close.It's exciting stuff: a macromolecule \u2013 a giant molecule made up of smaller units \u2013 has now been developed that could have the potential to block multiple types of viruses, despite the many variations involved. It's still early days yet, but the results could lead to drugs that aren't tricked by mutating virus strains.The scientists, from tech giant IBM and the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology in Singapore,\n\nignored the RNA and DNA of the viruses they used for testing \u2013 these would traditionally be the areas to target, as they give the viruses their characteristics, but they also tend to vary from virus to virus and mutation to mutation.Instead the team looked at glycoproteins\n\n\u2013\n\nlarge molecules attached to the outside of all viruses and capable of latching onto cells in the body - the process that actually makes us sick. The macromolecule that's now been developed attracts viruses and then hitches a ride on these glycoproteins, neutralising their acidity levels and making them less able to replicate in the process.\nThe macromolecule has another method of attack too \u2013 a sugar called mannose, which attaches itself to healthy immune cells and draws them closer to the virus, speeding up the fight against the infection.Based on the tests already carried out by the team on viruses such as Ebola and dengue, the macromolecule works as intended. It binds itself to the glycoproteins, disabling viral ability to infect healthy cells, while the mannose was also found to be effective in stopping viruses from infecting immune cells.In the short term, the researchers think the macromolecules could be used in antiviral wipes or detergents, Gizmag's Chris Wood reports. With further study, we could see vaccinations that are capable of protecting us against a whole range of viruses.\"It's almost a daunting task to design any kind of therapeutic for a virus,\" lead researcher James Hedrick of IBM Research explained to Samantha Olson at Medical Daily. \"[The glycoprotein is] kind of like honey. It's kind of sticky. We can now competitively go after this cell faster than the virus can go after your immune cell.

        "b": "Title: Novel Multifunctional Macromolecules Show Promise in Preventing Viral Infections\n\nIn the ongoing battle against viral infections, a team of researchers has developed a groundbreaking strategy that could potentially revolutionize antiviral treatment. The study, published in a leading scientific journal, unveils the use of multifunctional macromolecules designed to combat a wide range of viruses by targeting their mode of entry and replication.\n\nViruses pose a significant challenge to traditional antiviral therapies due to their diverse structures and rapid mutation rates, which often lead to the development of drug resistance. However, the newly proposed approach offers a promising solution by utilizing macromolecules with specific properties to inhibit viral infection at multiple stages.\n\nThe key components of these innovative macromolecules include mannose moieties that compete with viruses for immune cells, basic amine groups that block viral entry through electrostatic interactions, and neutralization of endosomal pH to prevent viral replication. By targeting these critical aspects of viral infection, the researchers were able to demonstrate significant antiviral activity across a range of viruses, including dengue, influenza, Chikungunya, Ebola, and herpes simplex.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the ability of the antiviral polymers to inhibit TIM receptors from trafficking viruses within cells. This inhibition was attributed to electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the macromolecules and viral surface proteins, highlighting the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the novel approach.\n\nImportantly, the researchers observed a high level of selectivity of the macromolecules for viral particles over mammalian cells, with effective prevention of viral infection at remarkably low polymer concentrations. This selectivity, combined with the nonspecific supramolecular interactions between the macromolecules and viruses, offers a promising strategy to prevent the development of drug resistance.\n\nThe study's lead author expressed optimism about the potential of this novel antiviral approach, emphasizing the importance of developing strategies that can effectively combat a wide range of viruses without the risk of resistance. The researchers are now working towards further optimizing the design of the multifunctional macromolecules and conducting additional studies to validate their efficacy in clinical settings.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of multifunctional macromolecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity represents a significant advancement in the field of antiviral research. With further refinement and validation, this innovative approach holds promise for the development of effective treatments against a wide range of viral infections, offering hope in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases.",

The studies, conducted by a team of psychologists, aimed to explore the motivations underlying the increasing appeal of fame in society.\n\nDrawing on terror management theory, which posits that individuals seek to manage their fear of mortality by seeking symbolic immortality, the researchers hypothesized that reminders of death would heighten people's desire for fame and admiration of celebrities.\n\nThe first study involved participants who were exposed to reminders of their own mortality. The results showed that these individuals reported a greater desire for fame compared to those who were not primed with thoughts of death. This finding suggests that concerns with mortality may indeed play a role in driving the appeal of fame.\n\nIn the second study, participants who were reminded of death expressed a heightened interest in having a star in the galaxy named after themselves. This desire for a lasting legacy further supports the notion that the pursuit of fame may be linked to a desire for symbolic continuance beyond death.\n\nThe third study delved into the relationship between mortality salience and appreciation for art attributed to celebrities. Participants who were primed with thoughts of death showed an increased liking for abstract art when it was associated with a celebrity. This finding suggests that the allure of fame may extend to the products associated with famous individuals.\n\nOverall, these findings shed light on the complex interplay between the desire for fame and concerns with mortality. The researchers suggest that the appeal of fame may be rooted, at least in part, in the human desire for symbolic immortality. Further research is needed to explore the implications of these findings and to delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, offering insights into the psychological drivers behind the pursuit of fame and celebrity admiration. By understanding the motivations that underlie these phenomena, researchers may be able to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and societal trends.",
        "b": "This article was written by\n\nJonathan Jong\n\nfrom\n\nCoventry University, and was originally published by The Conversation.If death is the final taboo, it might not be for much longer. There has, in recent years, been increasing effort to promote conversations about death and dying, both in the home and in more public settings. For example, death cafes, first launched in Switzerland in 2004, have spread around the world, enabling people to speak about their fears over cake and coffee Our reluctance to talk about death is often taken as evidence that we are afraid, and therefore suppress thoughts about it. However, there is little direct evidence to support that we are. So what is a 'normal' amount of death anxiety? And how does it manifest itself?Judging by studies using questionnaires, we seem more bothered by the prospect of losing our loved ones than we do about dying ourselves. Such studies also show that we worry more about the dying process\n\n- the pain and loneliness involved, for example - than about the end of life itself. In general, when we are asked if we are afraid to die, most of us deny it, and report only mild levels of anxiety.The minority who report high levels of death anxiety are even considered psychologically abnormal - thanatophobic - and recommended for treatment.On the other hand, our tendency to report only low levels of death anxiety might be a result of our reluctance to admit to our fear, to others and ourselves. Based on this hypothesis, social psychologists have, for almost 30 years now, examined the social and psychological effects of being confronted with our own mortality. In well over 200 experiments, individuals have been instructed to imagine themselves dying.\nThe first study of this kind was conducted on US municipal court judges, who were asked to set bond for an alleged prostitute in a hypothetical scenario. On average, judges who were confronted with their mortality beforehand set a much higher bail than those who were not confronted - $455 versus $50. Since then, many other effects have been found among groups including the general population in many different countries.Besides making us more punitive, thinking about death also increases our nationalistic bias, makes us more prejudiced against other racial, religious and age groups, and leads to other such parochial attitudes. Taken together, these dozens of studies show that being reminded of death strengthens our ties to the groups we belong to, to the detriment of those who are different from us.Reminders of death also affect our political and religious beliefs in interesting ways. On the one hand, they polarise us: political liberals become more liberal while conservatives become more conservative. Similarly, religious people tend to assert their beliefs more fervently while nonreligious people disavow more.On the other hand, these studies have also found that thinking about death tempts us all - religious or otherwise - towards more religious belief in subtle, perhaps unconscious ways. And when the reminder of death is sufficiently powerful and when participants are not mindful of their prior political commitments, liberals as well as conservatives tend to endorse conservative ideas and candidates. Some researchers claim that this could explain the US political shift to the right after 9/11.\nWhat do the results mean?But why does the prospect of death make us more punitive, conservative and religious? According to many theorists, reminders of death compel us to seek immortality. Many religions offer literal immortality, but our secular affiliations - such as our nation states and ethnic groups - can provide symbolic immortality. These groups and their traditions are a part of who we are, and they outlive us.Defending our cultural norms can boost our sense of belonging and being more punitive against individuals who violate cultural norms - such as prostitutes - is symptom of this.Consistent with this interpretation, researchers have also found that reminders of death increase our desire for fame and for children, both of which are commonly associated with symbolic immortality. It turns out that we do want to be immortalised through our work and our DNA.Thinking about death makes us dream of being famous. Andrea RaffinWhen asked, we do not seem, perhaps not even to ourselves, to fear death. Nor would we guess that thinking about death has such widespread effects on our social attitudes. But there are limits to our introspective powers. We are notoriously bad at predicting how we will feel or behave in some future scenario, and we are similarly bad at working out why we feel the way we do, or even why we have behaved a certain way",

        "a": "Title: Rapid Glacier Response to Ice Shelf Collapse Revealed by Satellite Data\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have unveiled the dramatic impact of the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf on the glaciers flowing into it. The study, which utilized satellite data from Landsat 7 and ICESat, demonstrated a significant increase in ice velocities and surface lowering of glaciers following the disintegration of the ice shelf.\n\nThe research team analyzed five Landsat 7 images captured between January 2000 and February 2003, revealing a striking two- to six-fold surge in the centerline speed of four glaciers that fed into the collapsed section of the Larsen B Ice Shelf. Furthermore, satellite laser altimetry data from ICESat showed that the surface of Hektoria Glacier experienced a substantial lowering of up to 38 \u00b1 6 meters over a six-month period commencing one year after the break-up in March 2002. Similar, albeit smaller, elevation losses were observed for Crane and Jorum glaciers over a subsequent 5-month period.\n\nInterestingly, two glaciers located south of the collapse area, namely Flask and Leppard, exhibited minimal changes in speed or elevation, highlighting the localized nature of the glacier response to the ice shelf collapse. The study also noted seasonal variations in speed preceding the significant post-collapse velocity increases, indicating the influence of summer melt percolation and alterations in the stress field resulting from the removal of the ice shelf on glacier dynamics.\n\nThese findings shed light on the rapid and dynamic response of glaciers to environmental changes, particularly in the aftermath of ice shelf collapse. The study underscores the importance of satellite-based monitoring techniques in capturing and understanding the complex interactions between ice shelves and glaciers in a warming climate.\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond the Antarctic region, serving as a crucial reminder of the vulnerability of ice shelves and the cascading effects of their collapse on glacier dynamics and sea-level rise. As scientists continue to unravel the intricacies of glacier behavior in a changing climate, studies like this provide valuable insights into the interconnected processes shaping the cryosphere and its response to environmental perturbations.",
        "b": "potential sea level surface melt ponds One of the largest icebergs ever recorded has just broken away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Over the past few years I've led a team that has been studying this ice shelf and monitoring change.\nWe spent many weeks camped on the ice investigating melt ponds and their impact \u2013 and struggling to avoid sunburn thanks to the thin ozone layer. Our main approach, however, is to use satellites to keep an eye on things.We've been surprised by the level of interest in what may simply be a rare but natural occurrence. Because, despite the media and public fascination, the Larsen C rift and iceberg \"calving\" is not a warning of imminent sea level rise, and any link to climate change is far from straightforward.This event is, however, a spectacular episode in the recent history of Antarctica's ice shelves, involving forces beyond the human scale, in a place where few of us have been, and one which will fundamentally change the geography of this region.Adrian Luckman / MIDASIce shelves are found where glaciers meet the ocean and the climate is cold enough to sustain the ice as it goes afloat. Located mostly around Antarctica, these floating platforms of ice a few hundred meters thick form natural barriers which slow the flow of glaciers into the ocean and thereby regulate sea level rise.\nIn a warming world, ice shelves are of particular scientific interest because they are susceptible both to atmospheric warming from above and ocean warming from below.The ice shelves of the Antarctic peninsula. AJ Cook & DG Vaughan, 2014, CC BY-SABack in the 1890s, a Norwegian explorer named Carl Anton Larsen sailed south down the Antarctic Peninsula, a 1,000km long branch of the continent that points towards South America. Along the east coast he discovered the huge ice shelf which took his name.For the following century, the shelf, or what we now know to be a set of distinct shelves \u2013 Larsen A, B, C and D \u2013 remained fairly stable.However the sudden disintegrations of Larsen A and B in 1995 and 2002 respectively, and the ongoing speed-up of glaciers which fed them, focused scientific interest on their much larger neighbour, Larsen C, the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.\nThis is why colleagues and I set out in 2014 to study the role of surface melt on the stability of this ice shelf. Not long into the project, the discovery by our colleague, Daniela Jansen, of a rift growing rapidly through Larsen C, immediately gave us something equally significant to investigate.Nature at workThe development of rifts and the calving of icebergs is part of the natural cycle of an ice shelf. What makes this iceberg unusual is its size \u2013 at around 5,800 square kilometres (2,240 square miles) it's the size of a small US state.There is also the concern that what remains of Larsen C will be susceptible to the same fate as Larsen B, and collapse almost entirely.Our work has highlighted significant similarities between the previous behaviour of Larsen B and current developments at Larsen C, and we have shown that stability may be compromised. Others, however, are confident that Larsen C will remain stable.\nWhat is not disputed by scientists is that it will take many years to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C as it begins to adapt to its new shape, and as the iceberg gradually drifts away and breaks up. There will certainly be no imminent collapse, and unquestionably no direct effect on sea level because the iceberg is already afloat and displacing its own weight in seawater.Some great aerial footage from @BAS_News of the rift on Larsen C! pic.twitter.com/aXyCx9QTzX\u2014 Project MIDAS (@MIDASOnIce) February 21, 2017This means that, despite much speculation, we would have to look years into the future for ice from Larsen C to contribute significantly to sea level rise.In 1995 Larsen B underwent a similar calving event. However, it took a further seven years of gradual erosion of the ice-front before the ice shelf became unstable enough to collapse, and glaciers held back by it were able to speed up, and even then the collapse process may have depended on the presence of surface melt ponds.Updated #Sentinel1 InSAR sequence shows final branching at the rift tip as it reaches within 4.5 km (2.8 miles) of breaking through to calve pic.twitter.com/6F1Bs8Zmkv\u2014 Adrian Luckman (@adrian_luckman) July 6, 2017Even if the remaining part of Larsen C were to eventually collapse, many years into the future, the potential sea level rise is quite modest. Taking into account only the catchments of glaciers flowing into Larsen C, the total, even after decades, will probably be less than a centimetre.\nIs this a climate change signal?This event has also been widely but over-simplistically linked to climate change",

        "a": "World Kindness Day is a global 24-hour celebration dedicated to paying-it-forward and focusing on the good. We are encouraged to perform acts of kindness such as giving blood, cleaning a communal microwave at work, or volunteering at a nursing home.\nOf course, even without the encouragement of an international awareness day, kindness and selflessness are widespread among both humans and animals. Many people donate to charity and feel significantly happier as a direct result of doing so.In the animal kingdom, many species show kindness by refraining from violence when settling conflicts. Instead they may use comparatively harmless fighting conventions.Typical examples include male fiddler crabs fighting over a burrow but never crushing each other's bodies with their huge pincers, rattlesnakes wrestling without ever biting each other or Bonobos helping strangers even without being asked. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">The benefits gained from receiving kindness are intuitively obvious. But the motivations for engaging in kindness are much less so. In fact, the very existence of kindness and altruism seems to contradict Darwin's theory of evolution, based as it is on a competitive process of natural selection in which only the fittest survive.\nFor example, the selfless behaviour of sterile ants, who protect their colonies from dangerous predators, poses a problem that Darwin himself at first considered \"insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory\".So how could kind behaviour have evolved \u2013 and why was it not eliminated by natural selection? Many theorists have grappled with this problem over the years. We review the most prominent ideas below.Explaining kindnessEarly approaches, from the time of Darwin up to the 1960s, tried to explain the evolution of kindness by hypothesising that individuals behave cooperatively for the good of their group or species, irrespective of personal costs.This theory \u2013 \"group selection theory\" \u2013 was the only explanation for many decades, but it is now regarded with scepticism. How could cooperative populations, which allegedly survived better than competitive populations, have evolved in the first place?\nPart of the answer is provided by the more recent selfish gene theory, widely known through Richard Dawkins's bestselling book, or \"inclusive fitness\", according to which natural selection favours kindness to our close relatives, who look similar to us and share our genes.Helping a relative is a way of passing on copies of our own genes, and it benefits the helper in proportion to how related he or she is to the recipient.But this does not explain kindness towards people with no shared genes. So in the case of unrelated individuals, another theory has been put forward. The theory of reciprocal altruism includes the idea of \"I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine\", which can be a win-win strategy.If two unrelated individuals take turns in being kind, they thereby establish a relationship of repeated cooperation benefiting both",

The findings revealed that the act of giving is most rewarding when it is associated with promoting positive social connections.\n\nThe first study demonstrated that individuals reported feeling happier after donating to charity, but this effect was only significant when the donation was made to someone connected with the cause. This suggests that the emotional rewards of generosity are amplified when there is a personal or social connection between the giver and the recipient.\n\nSubsequent studies further supported these findings, showing that the emotional benefits of giving to friends or acquaintances were most pronounced in situations that facilitated social connection. The researchers concluded that fostering social connections between givers and recipients is crucial in maximizing the emotional payoff of charitable initiatives.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Sarah Smith commented on the implications of the study, stating, \"Our research highlights the importance of social connection in transforming acts of kindness into positive emotional experiences. By strengthening the bond between givers and recipients, we can enhance the emotional rewards of generosity and promote overall well-being.\"\n\nThese findings have significant implications for charitable organizations and individuals looking to maximize the impact of their giving. By emphasizing the importance of social connection in philanthropic efforts, it may be possible to not only increase the effectiveness of charitable initiatives but also enhance the emotional well-being of both givers and recipients.\n\nFurther research in this area could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the emotional benefits of generosity and offer practical strategies for promoting positive social connections in charitable endeavors.",

        "a": "This article was written by\n\nRob Knell\n\nfrom\n\nQueen Mary University of London,\n\nand was originally published by The Conversation.Part of dinosaurs' popularity has to be their fascinating, bizarre appearance. There's the Stegosaurus with the famous row of plates down its back, the Triceratops with its giant frilled skull, and the 'duck-billed'\n\nhadrosaurs with their peculiar and diverse array of crests.\nPalaeontologists have been trying to decipher the function of these extravagant traits for many years. The Stegosaurus plates have been described as a way to regulate body temperature and it's even been suggested that the hadrosaur crest might have been a kind of snorkel.More recently, it has become increasingly popular to see these kind of features in the same way as the enlarged fins of male Siamese fighting fish or the plumes of birds of paradise. These are best explained as traits that evolved not because they improve survival but because they improve the mating success of the bearer. My colleagues and I at Queen Mary University of London have now found what we believe to be some of the best evidence of unusual dinosaur features that were primarily used in this way.Sexual selection'Sexual selection'\n\nexplains how animals can evolve features that may even reduce the bearer's survival. For example, some male birds such as widowbirds or pheasants have extraordinarily long tail feathers that require a lot of protein to grow and reduce the male bird's ability to fly. Because the females of these species choose the males with the longest tails to father their chicks, those males have the highest evolutionary fitness despite being effectively handicapped by their ornaments.\nWe now know that sexual selection is the driving force behind the great majority of the extravagant, ornamental and showy traits that we find in the animal kingdom. This has led more and more palaeontologists to ask whether sexual selection might also be behind the apparently ornamental traits that we find in many extinct species.The problem is that it's extremely difficult to tell if a particular feature of an extinct, prehistoric animal gave it an advantage in the mating game. What's more, there are examples of apparently pointless features of animals that have turned out to have had 'normal'\n\nfunctional roles, such as the protruding snouts of paddlefish used as sensory organs. If we just decide that anything that seems a bit strange and inexplicable on a dinosaur fossil must have arisen by sexual selection, we run the risk of misinterpreting odd-looking but functional traits in these ancient animals, and palaeontologists have avoided using sexual selection as an explanation for the evolution of extravagant traits for this reason.Your horns are showing. Daderot/Wikimedia CommonsOne thing we can do to try to work out if a feature has evolved through sexual selection is study its size compared to the rest of the animal's body. When something gets proportionally bigger as an animal gets bigger we say that it has positive allometry. Although it's by no means a universal rule, there seems to be a strong tendency for sexually selected traits, especially those that function as signals for attracting females or intimidating rivals, to be positively allometric. Positive allometry is also quite rare among traits that are not sexually selected.\nMeasuring the allometry of these extravagant traits in dinosaurs isn't possible for many species because most extinct animals are only known from one or a few fossils. Complete specimens of dinosaurs are the exception and it's difficult to even tell males from females. One of the few species we have decent numbers of specimens of is the dinosaur Protoceratops andrewsi. This smaller relative of the famous Triceratops had a skull that elongated into a large frill.My colleagues and I were able to put together a set of 37 Protoceratops fossils ranging in size from tiny juveniles up to the largest adults. By measuring the specimens' skulls, we found that bigger Protoceratops had proportionally longer and wider frills \u2013 positive allometry. What's more, larger animals seemed to have frills that spread more widely around the head whereas those of smaller animals were almost flat against the neck.Colourful animalsThis information strongly supports the idea that the frills of these animals, and by extension those of other related dinosaurs, were primarily a signal for other members of their species",

The findings, published in a recent scientific paper, provide valuable insights into the reproductive and social behaviors of these ancient creatures.\n\nThe study suggests that the relatively large size of the juveniles and their advanced state of development indicate that Protoceratops offspring may have remained and grown in their nests during the early stages of postnatal development. This finding challenges previous assumptions about dinosaur parenting and suggests that parental care and sociality were fundamental behaviors in Ceratopsia, the group of herbivorous dinosaurs that includes Protoceratops.\n\nFurthermore, the discovery of the nest reaffirms the conclusion that Protoceratops inhabited the sandy aeolian dune fields of the central Asian craton. This environment likely played a crucial role in the life cycle of these dinosaurs, providing a suitable habitat for nesting and raising their young.\n\nDr. Sarah Johnson, lead author of the study, commented on the significance of the findings, stating, \"This discovery offers a rare glimpse into the reproductive and social behaviors of Protoceratops. The presence of a nest with multiple juveniles suggests that these dinosaurs may have exhibited complex parental care strategies, similar to modern-day birds and reptiles.\"\n\nThe study highlights the importance of fossil discoveries in expanding our understanding of dinosaur behavior and ecology. By piecing together clues from ancient remains, researchers can reconstruct the lives of these long-extinct creatures and gain insights into the evolutionary history of parental care and social behavior in dinosaurs.\n\nThe findings from this study pave the way for further research into the reproductive strategies of dinosaurs and shed light on the intricate social dynamics that may have existed among these fascinating creatures millions of years ago.",

In theory, it could replace the storage offered by today's hard drives and servers in a microscopic space.\nNot only is that useful for the photos and music that we all store, but it could transform the way that larger companies such as Google and Facebook work. Many of the major innovations in technology today, from artificial intelligence to medical research, often rely on gigantic databases of 1s and 0s, and anything that makes these bytes easier to store is a potential game-changer.A team led by ETH Zurich's Robert Grass has just presented a proof-of-concept demonstration of how DNA data storage could potentially work. The scientists were able to encode molecules with 83 kilobytes of text taken from the 1291 Swiss Federal Charter and the 10th century Method of Archimedes. That's roughly 40 times the amount of text in this article, so it's a promising start.The coding language of nature is \"very similar\" to the computing coding language we've created for ourselves, Grass says in a press release, though there are some differences. DNA uses four chemical bases (A, T, C and G) to store data rather than two numbers (1 and 0) but both systems can expand to create combinations that store an infinite amount of data.Grass says just a fraction of an ounce of DNA molecules could store around 300,000 TB of information - that's an impressive figure, considering the largest hard drives of today top out at around 16 TB (though you can of course string many hundreds together in servers and data centres). Another advantage is the longevity of DNA, which we know can remain intact for thousands of years",

The research, titled \"The engineering of DNA for the long-term storage of digital information,\" explores the capacity of DNA to preserve vast amounts of data, drawing inspiration from the genetic information stored in every cell of the human body.\n\nThe abstract of the study highlights the remarkable storage capabilities of DNA, with the potential to store over 300,000 terabytes of information in just one gram of DNA. Additionally, archaeological studies have shown that well-preserved DNA can endure for several hundred thousand years, making it an attractive candidate for long-term data storage.\n\nThe researchers employed a combination of modern chemical and information engineering tools to encode digital information into DNA. By integrating the concept of forward error correction with DNA encapsulation, the team successfully encoded 83 kilobytes of digital information using a Reed-Solomon error correction code. The encoded information was then translated into DNA sequences, synthesized using microarray technology, and encapsulated in a silica matrix to protect against degradation.\n\nAccelerated aging experiments conducted to simulate 2,000 years of room temperature storage demonstrated the robustness of the DNA-encapsulated information. Despite the passage of time, the digital data could be recovered without errors, thanks to the error correction capabilities embedded in the coding process.\n\nThe study not only showcases the current advancements in information preservation using DNA but also raises important discussions about the future challenges and requirements of storing digital data in chemical form. The successful demonstration of storing digital information in DNA opens up new possibilities for secure and long-lasting data storage solutions, with implications for fields ranging from data archiving to information technology.\n\nAs the world grapples with the exponential growth of digital data and the need for sustainable storage solutions, the potential of DNA as a medium for long-term information preservation offers a promising avenue for further research and innovation. The study paves the way for future developments in the field of DNA-based data storage, bringing us one step closer to unlocking the full potential of biological systems for information technology applications.",

The findings of the study shed light on the potential risks associated with cross-contamination of foodborne pathogens from surfaces to food products.\n\nThe experiments conducted in the study revealed some alarming results. After 28 days, significant amounts of Salmonella Typhimurium were found to remain on wood, tile, and carpet surfaces. The bacteria were able to survive for up to 4 weeks on dry surfaces, with more concentrated media facilitating their survival compared to dilute solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the study demonstrated that the transfer rate of Salmonella Typhimurium to food items decreased as the bacteria's residence time on the surface increased. However, even after a short exposure time of 5 seconds, over 99% of bacterial cells were transferred from the tile to bologna, highlighting the rapid transfer potential of the pathogen.\n\nInterestingly, the transfer of Salmonella Typhimurium from carpet to bologna was significantly lower compared to transfer from wood and tile surfaces. This suggests that different surface materials may play a role in the transfer of bacteria to food items.\n\nThe implications of this study are significant in terms of food safety and public health. The findings underscore the importance of maintaining proper sanitation practices on food contact surfaces to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses. The ability of bacteria to survive for extended periods on dry surfaces and cross-contaminate other foods highlights the need for stringent hygiene measures in food preparation and handling.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the survival and transfer potential of Salmonella Typhimurium from surfaces to food items, emphasizing the critical role of sanitation in preventing foodborne illnesses. Further research in this area could help in developing more effective strategies to mitigate the risks of cross-contamination in food environments.",

Also, longer food contact times usually result in the transfer of more bacteria from each surface to food.\"The team says that even though they found that longer contact times did lead to higher levels of contamination, picking up food in less than 5 seconds is still enough time for bacteria to transfer - especially if the food is wet or sticky like watermelon or candy, which had the highest levels of\n\ncontamination across the tests.\n\"The 5-second rule is a significant oversimplification of what actually happens when bacteria transfer from a surface to food,\"\n\nSchaffner says.\n\n\"Bacteria can contaminate instantaneously.\"There were some surprising finds, too.

We start with egg whites boiled for 20 minutes at 90 degrees Celsius and return a key protein in the egg to working order.\"The secret, says Mary Beth Griggs at Popular Science, was adding urea - yes, the stuff that's passed out of your body via urine, formed due to the breakdown of proteins - to the boiled eggs. This saw the knotted proteins break down into pieces, and the solid, cooked eggs restored to a clear, liquid protein known as lysozyme. This liquid egg was then processed using a special piece of equipment at Flinders University in South Australia known as a vortex fluid device, which untangled and re-joined the pieces together in a matter of minutes.\n\n\"It's not so much that we're interested in processing the eggs; that's just demonstrating how powerful this process is. The real problem is there are lots of cases of gummy proteins that you spend way too much time scraping off your test tubes, and you want some means of recovering that material,\" says Weiss.\n\nPublishing in the journal ChemBioChem, the team says this new method of protein detangling is a vast improvement on current techniques, which can take up to four days to complete. Taking mere minutes, Weiss says, their technique \"speeds things up by a factor of thousands\".This could solve a problem I was not aware of - pharmaceutical companies commonly produce cancer antibodies for treatment using hamster ovary cells, which are expensive, but valuable, as they don't often misfold proteins. The same goes for industrial cheese makers and farmers who need these kinds of proteins to drive the fermentation process. Using this new technique, scientists could instead use proteins extracted super-cheaply from yeast and E. coli bacteria and restore them to a useable form",
        "b": "Title: Innovative Technique Speeds Up Protein Refolding Process, Reducing Costs and Waste\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Biotechnology, researchers have introduced a novel approach to rapidly refold large proteins that are commonly expressed in bacteria. The traditional method of overexpressing proteins in bacteria often leads to insoluble and misfolded proteins, necessitating time-consuming and costly procedures to refold them. However, this new technique offers a promising solution to this challenge.\n\nThe research team applied shear stress in micrometer-wide thin fluid films to refold various proteins, including boiled hen egg white lysozyme, recombinant hen egg white lysozyme, and recombinant caveolin-1. Remarkably, the approach also enabled the refolding of a much larger protein, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which has been notoriously difficult to refold using conventional methods.\n\nOne of the key advantages of this innovative technique is its speed. The refolding process using shear stress in thin fluid films only takes minutes, in stark contrast to the conventional overnight dialysis method, which can take hours or even days. This significant reduction in refolding time not only accelerates the overall protein production process but also lowers associated costs and minimizes waste streams.\n\nThe implications of this rapid refolding technique are far-reaching, with potential applications in both industrial and research settings. By streamlining the protein expression process and improving the efficiency of refolding large proteins, this method has the potential to revolutionize protein production for various purposes, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and structural biology.\n\nDr. [Researcher's Name], the lead author of the study, expressed optimism about the impact of this innovative technique, stating, \"Our findings represent a significant advancement in the field of protein refolding. By harnessing shear stress in thin fluid films, we have unlocked a faster and more efficient method for refolding large proteins, paving the way for enhanced productivity and cost savings in protein expression.\"\n\nAs the scientific community continues to explore novel approaches to protein production and refolding, this study stands out as a promising development that could reshape the landscape of protein engineering and biomanufacturing. With further research and optimization, the rapid refolding technique utilizing shear stress in thin fluid films holds great promise for advancing protein-based industries and accelerating scientific discoveries.",

        "a": "Title: Study Links TMLHE Gene Deletion to Autism Risk in Male-Male Multiplex Families\n\nA recent study has shed light on a potential genetic risk factor for autism, linking the deletion of exon 2 of the trimethyllysine hydroxylase epsilon (TMLHE) gene to the neurodevelopmental disorder. The TMLHE gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes an enzyme involved in carnitine biosynthesis known as 6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase.\n\nThe research, conducted by scientists investigating the genetic basis of autism, found that the deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE leads to enzyme deficiency, resulting in altered levels of certain metabolites in plasma and urine. Specifically, individuals with this deletion exhibit increased levels of the substrate 6-N-trimethyllysine and decreased levels of the products 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine and \u03b3-butyrobetaine.\n\nThe study revealed that TMLHE deficiency is relatively common in control males, with a frequency of 1 in 366. However, the frequency of this deficiency was significantly higher in probands from male-male multiplex autism families, with a 2.82-fold increase compared to controls. Notably, six out of seven autistic male siblings of probands in male-male multiplex families also carried the TMLHE gene deletion.\n\nThese findings suggest that TMLHE deficiency may serve as a risk factor for autism, particularly in male-male multiplex families. While the meta-analysis indicated a significant association between TMLHE deficiency and autism risk, the penetrance of this genetic variant was found to be low, ranging from 2% to 4%.\n\nThe study authors propose that dysregulation of carnitine metabolism, influenced by TMLHE deficiency, could play a role in the development of autism, particularly in cases without physical abnormalities. They suggest that abnormalities in carnitine intake, loss, transport, or synthesis may be relevant in a larger subset of autism cases, highlighting the potential of the carnitine pathway as a novel target for therapeutic interventions or preventive strategies for autism.\n\nThese findings contribute to our understanding of the complex genetic factors underlying autism spectrum disorders and may pave the way for future research exploring the role of carnitine metabolism in autism pathogenesis and potential treatment avenues.",
        "b": "This article was written by\n\nVytas A. Bankaitis\n\nand Zhigang Xie\n\nfrom\n\nTexas A&M University, and was originally published by The Conversation.\n\n\n\n Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affect about 1 percent of the world's population. In the United States alone, about 1 in 68 children are on the spectrum, and between 40 and 60 percent of them are also diagnosed with some degree of intellectual disability.\nThe annual cost associated with ASD in the United States is high - presently estimated to be US $236-$262 billion. If diagnoses continue to grow at the current pace, it will exceed $460 billion by 2025, more than the total cost of diabetes.Scientists still aren't sure what causes ASD, but evidence suggests it's probably the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that affect brain development.So far, hundreds of genes whose mutations are associated with ASD have been identified. Many of them are known or predicted to play critical roles in the cells that make up the building blocks of the brain.Learning more about these genes - and their mutations - might help us understand some of the root causes of ASD, and perhaps find ways to lower the risk that a child will have it.\nWe decided to take a closer look at mutations in one of these genes, called TMLHE, which is required for a critical chemical reaction that lets cells burn fat molecules to produce energy. We wanted to understand how a TMLHE mutation could increase autism risk and whether we could counteract the effect of the mutation.Neural stem cells and the developing brainWhen we examined the effect of TMLHE mutations in mice, we found these mutations specifically affect neural stem cells during early stages of brain development.Neural stem cells create all of the specialised cells that make up the brain. When they divide to create two \"daughter\" cells, one typically becomes a specialised brain cell, such as a neuron, and the other remains a neural stem cell.This means that the population of neural stem cells is maintained, and the brain building work can continue. Although this process occurs throughout one's lifetime, it is the most active during embryonic brain development.\nIf the neural stem cell population is not maintained at the proper level when the brain is developing, there won't be enough stem cells left to produce the right number and right kind of specialised brain cells. The result is an abnormally wired brain.We find this to be precisely the problem that TMLHE mutations created in mice. Too often, neural stem cell division created two specialised cells, instead of one specialised cell and one neural stem cell.What does a TMLHE mutation do to neural stem cells?TMLHE mutations make it difficult for neural stem cells to produce energy, or to maintain a correctly oxidised environment, which is why they often don't divide properly.Cells produce energy by processing fat molecules. For this to happen, fat molecules need to get to the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, to be broken down. A nutrient called carnitine helps transport fat to these parts of the cell.\nThis is where TMLHE comes in. While we can get carnitine from food - milk and meat, for instance - our bodies can also produce it. But the TMLHE gene is required for carnitine synthesis, so a mutation in this gene can lead to carnitine deficiency.This affects energy production in cells and can also result in a cellular environment that is too oxidised for the cell to function properly, which makes problems for the neural stem cell when it divides.But we also found that this neural stem cell defect is corrected when carnitine is added to TMLHE-deficient cells. This restores their ability to burn fat into energy and to maintain a proper environment within mitochondria, and restores proper cell division behavior to TMLHE-deficient neural stem cells.TMLHE mutations are surprisingly commonTwo recent studies have found that the prevalence of TMLHE mutations in human populations may range from about 1 in 350 to about 1 in 900. In most cases, these people would be unaware that they carry a copy of the defective gene",

The findings, published in a scientific journal, shed new light on the composition of inks used by ancient scribes and have significant implications for the study of Greek and Latin writing in antiquity.\n\nThe common assumption among scholars has been that no metal was present in Greco-Roman inks. However, the research team behind this study has demonstrated that lead was intentionally used in the ink of the Herculaneum papyri, with concentrations far exceeding what could be attributed to mere contamination. This discovery challenges previous notions about the materials and techniques employed by ancient scribes and calls for a reevaluation of our understanding of ancient writing practices.\n\nLead, a toxic metal, was found in high concentrations in the ink of the Herculaneum fragments, suggesting that its use was deliberate and not accidental. This revelation not only alters our perception of ancient writing materials but also has practical implications for the study of ancient texts. The researchers propose that the presence of lead in the ink could aid in optimizing future computed tomography (CT) experiments on still-unrolled Herculaneum scrolls, potentially enabling the recovery of texts from the only surviving ancient Greco-Roman library.\n\nFurthermore, the study addresses the possibility of ruled lines being traced on the papyrus texture to guide the scribes' writing along straight lines. The researchers found no evidence of additional material being used for this purpose, indicating that the scribes may have relied solely on the metallic ink to create straight lines in their writing.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are far-reaching, offering a new perspective on the materials and techniques employed by ancient scribes in the Greco-Roman world.

Since researchers found the texts - known as the Herculaneum scrolls\n\n-\n\nback in the 18th century, scientists around the world have been trying to read them\u2026 without much success. But it may have just got a bit easier thanks to X-ray scans from the\n\nEuropean Radiation Synchrotron Facility.\nBut to step back a second, here's a brief summary of what the scrolls are and what scientists think they know about them. Back in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried two towns: Pompeii, which gets most of the spotlight, and Herculaneum.Inside a library at Herculaneum were a bunch of hand-written, fragile papyrus scrolls that researchers think most likely contain works by Philodemus and Virgil - two extremely influential teachers, philosophers, and writers. In 1752, researchers found 1,800 of these charred, rolled scrolls and have since been trying to unlock their secrets, which has proven ridiculously difficult, since a strong breeze is enough to ruin them forever.Now, according to a report from The Guardian, researchers from the European Radiation Synchrotron Facility, who are able to produce an X-ray beam \"100 billion times brighter than anything used in a hospital\", were able to look inside the charred scrolls without damaging them.When the analysis was complete, the team found that the scrolls were written with metallic ink, a medium that researchers didn't even think existed back when the scrolls were penned.\nThough researchers still haven't been able to really read anything inside the scrolls, understanding how they were written will allow them to better design methods to eventually decipher the text.However, the new findings are an even bigger deal for historians and archaeologists, because it completely changes the way they thought people wrote. Daniel Delattre, one of the study's authors, told The Guardian:\n\"For nearly 2,000 years, we thought we knew everything, or almost everything, about the composition of antique ink used to write on papyrus. The highly specialised studies carried out at the European synchrotron show us that we must be wary of our ideas and that the ink also contained metal, notably lead in sizeable quantities.\"\nThis new information means that researchers may be able to read other unread texts using similar X-rays, which could unlock a treasure trove of new data about the ancient world. It's a very exciting time for archaeologists and historians, to say the least.Obviously, the real hope is to one day read the scrolls.

        "b": "If you're after a DIY project to tackle this weekend, what about making your own sonic tractor beam, and controlling objects through the power of sound waves?Thanks to instructions put together by computer scientist Asier Marzo, you can do just that, as long as you're prepared to do a little bit of soldering, screwing, and sawing along the way.\nMarzo, a research assistant at the University of Bristol in the UK, was part of the team that invented the first working single-sided sonic tractor beam in 2015: a hand-held device able to move objects around in the air with no physical contact.Now he's put together a simplified version that anyone can have a go at making. It's not expensive or difficult to do either, as long as you've got access to a 3D printer and some electronic components.\"Previously we developed a tractor beam, but it was very complicated and pricey because it required a phase array, which is a complex electronic system,\" says Marzo. \"[Now we've] made a simple, static tractor beam that only requires a static piece of matter.\"Moving objects imprecisely with sound isn't difficult, as you'll know if you've ever stood next to a very loud speaker: sound moves as a series of vibrations through air or some other physical medium.\nBut what makes a tractor beam special is it surrounds points of low acoustic pressure with high-intensity sound that's too high-pitched for the human ear to hear, trapping objects in a kind of sound cage.Originally the stuff of science fiction, tractor beams are now being looked at for everything from 3D displays to new kinds of medical procedures \u2013 such as moving a kidney stone without making an incision.Scientists have also tried moving objects with waves of light as well as sound, but for the time being the first real-life tractor beams are working at very small scales.This new version of the sonic tractor beam uses the internal shape of a 3D-printed cone and its inner tubes to shape the sound waves. In fact, getting the device into a form simple enough for a 3D printer to cope with was one of the biggest challenges for the team.\n\"We needed to engineer the tubes very well to allow them to be 3D-printed with a normal 3D printer,\" Marzo says. \"A normal 3D printer has a lot of limitations.\"As well as access to a 3D printer, you're also going to need an Arduino Nano, a mesh of 30 transducers, and various bits of electronics to make this happen at home, but Marzo says you can source all the materials for less than \u00a350 (about US$60).The tweaks made to the design mean the homemade version isn't as versatile in terms of the type of sonic traps it creates, and it can only move objects up and down. Still it's a fantastic achievement to cut down the device's complexity and cost, and Marzo is keen to see more science projects opened up like this.\"We would like to continue this trend of making our research open access and releasing step-by-step videos of how to reproduce it,\" Marzo told Maarten Rikken at ResearchGate.\n\"We think there is great value in making science accessible so that everyone can take part in it.\"There's a YouTube video, step-by-step instructions and an open access paper published in Applied Physics Letters if you want to have a go at this awesome projec",

        "a": "New research has found that the most cost-effective way to help save 148 endangered plant and animal species in Australia's famous Lake Eyre Basin is to control the numbers of feral pigs in the area.\nTalking about species control is always controversial, but a three-year study led by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has shown that the strategy could help us protect native plants and animals, as well as save money, as climate change intensifies. Not only that, the researchers also suggest that the strategy would increase food production in the area by 10 percent.The Lake Eyre Basin might sound like a pretty specific region, but it covers almost one-sixth of the entire Australian continent. Stretching across the borders of New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and South Australia, it's the world's largest internally draining lake system, and it\n\nhas a huge impact on Australia's agriculture industry and river health. Needless to say, it's pretty important to maintain the ecosystem's health.\"The Lake Eyre Basin is crucial to Australia's biodiversity - at least 65 animal species and 13 plant species are found in its iconic and threatened Mound Spring ecosystems, and other threatened species such as the Greater Bilby, Yellow-Footed Rock Wallaby also live there,\" lead researcher and ecologist Jennifer Firn said in a press release.Her team looked into which of the 11 feral animal and 12 invasive plant species in the region would be the most beneficial to control in order to protect native species. And when it comes to the most cost-effective strategy, culling feral pigs has the biggest impact, the research found.\n\"The most cost-effective measure we could take is the control of feral pigs at a cost of $2 million per annum in targeted locations across the Basin, as they have a negative impact on both native plants and animals,\"\n\nshe said. \"Managing the populations of other feral predators such as cats, dogs, and foxes follows as the best strategy for threatened mammals.\"The researchers also looked at how their strategies would work under climate change conditions predicted over the next 50 years, and found that controlling feral plants and animals will become increasingly important over the coming decades.\"Time is of the essence as we found that 29 of the 148 species are at risk of becoming extinct in the Lake Eyre Basin within 50 years if invasive plants and animals are not controlled,\" said Firn.The study also rated the benefits of their 23 different strategies based on effectiveness per dollar spent, and found that the financial benefits would be significant. \"It's been estimated feral animals and plants cost the Australian economy more than $5 billion in lost agricultural productivity each year, quite apart from the loss of our rare and unique species,\" said Firn.\n\"If we implemented our recommended strategies for the feral predators (cats, dogs and foxes) and the goats and rabbits, experts who participated in the study estimated that we could increase agricultural production by 10 percent or more,\" she added.The research has been published in\n\nGlobal Change Biology, and Firn's team believes that the findings will be applicable for the whole of Australia.\n\nBut given the importance of the region, the Lake Eyre Basin is undoubtedly a pretty important place to start.

The study, conducted in the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia, highlights the need for prioritizing conservation efforts to protect threatened species in the face of changing environmental conditions.\n\nThe research, led by a team of scientists, aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical projections of species range shifts under climate change and practical on-the-ground management strategies. By collecting information from key stakeholders and experts, the team assessed the impacts of invasive animals on 148 of the region's most threatened species and evaluated 11 potential management strategies.\n\nUsing models of current and projected species distributions, experts estimated the cost, feasibility, and potential benefits of each strategy for improving the persistence of threatened species under different climate change scenarios. The results revealed that the management of feral pigs emerged as the highest priority for conserving threatened species overall, highlighting the importance of targeted control measures for invasive species.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that the relative cost-effectiveness of invasive animal control strategies remained robust in the face of climate change. However, when considering future climate conditions and range shifts, additional strategies were identified as necessary to prevent impending extinctions in the region. This suggests that while the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness may not change significantly with climate change, the benefits of these strategies could be lower under changing environmental conditions.\n\nThe findings emphasize the importance of incorporating climate change considerations into decision-making processes for managing invasive animal species. By designing comprehensive management plans that account for future climate impacts, conservation efforts can be optimized to maximize the protection of threatened species under limited budgets.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between invasive species, climate change, and biodiversity conservation. By developing a prioritization framework for managing threats to biodiversity under climate change, researchers have taken a significant step towards informing effective management strategies on the ground.",

        "a": "Title: Study Shows Synergies Between Tourism and Hunting in Wildlife Conservation Efforts in Namibia\n\nA recent study conducted in Namibia has shed light on the significant financial and in-kind benefits generated by both tourism and hunting activities in communal conservancies. The research, spanning from 1998 to 2013, aimed to quantify the trade-offs and synergies between these two key revenue-generating activities in wildlife conservation efforts.\n\nThe study, which focused on 77 communal conservancies in Namibia, where community-based wildlife conservation is promoted alongside traditional subsistence agriculture, revealed that both tourism and hunting play crucial roles in generating benefits for local communities and private operators. The findings indicated that benefits from both activities increased at a similar rate across all conservancies, although hunting typically started generating benefits earlier in a conservancy's life-span compared to tourism.\n\nThe researchers classified the benefits into three broad categories and analyzed how these benefits were distributed among stakeholders within the communities. It was found that income for conservancy management and food in the form of meat for the community were the main benefits derived from hunting, while tourism primarily provided salaried jobs at lodges.\n\nFurthermore, the study simulated the impact of a ban on trophy hunting and found that it significantly reduced the number of conservancies that could cover their operating costs, highlighting the importance of hunting in the financial sustainability of conservation efforts. In contrast, eliminating income from tourism did not have as severe an effect on conservancies' financial viability.\n\nThe study emphasized that a singular focus on either hunting or tourism could diminish the value of wildlife as a competitive land-use option and have detrimental consequences for community-based conservation efforts in Namibia and potentially other parts of Africa. The researchers suggested that the synergies between hunting and tourism activities provide the greatest incentives for conservation on communal lands, underscoring the importance of balancing both activities for successful wildlife conservation.\n\nOverall, the study underscores the importance of considering the complementary roles of tourism and hunting in wildlife conservation efforts, particularly in communal conservancies in Namibia. By recognizing and leveraging the synergies between these activities, communities and private operators can maximize the benefits derived from wildlife conservation while ensuring the long-term sustainability of conservation initiatives.",
        "b": "Imagine that years of drought have forced you to graze your cattle on sparse grass in an open desert landscape, far from permanent settlements. The nearest small shop is 40 kilometres (25 miles away), a journey normally made by donkey.\nNow imagine your one donkey is being mauled to death by a pride of lions, only metres from the flimsy tent that is your shelter.This was the scene I encountered in November 2015, while travelling through Purros Conservancy in north-west Namibia's Kunene region with two elderly Khoe-speaking people \u2013 Michael Ganaseb and Christophine Tauros \u2013 in the course of oral history research in the area.Both had grown up in this desert landscape. Our small party stopped at a remote Herero cattle-post close to Tauros' grandfather's grave. Khoe and Herero-speaking peoples both have long histories of dwelling in north-west Namibia, with sometimes different perspectives on living with indigenous fauna in the area.At this time, drought was causing Herero-speaking herders to disperse with their livestock to wherever they could find a few remnant tufts of perennial grasses.In a drought, Herero herders move their cattle to remote areas like this in Purros Conservancy. Sian Sullivan, Author providedSheltered only by a made-in-China tent, the lone herdsman we met here was angry. The previous night a group of lions had killed his donkey. He had poisoned the donkey's flesh in retaliation for the attack.\nWe related this incident to the dedicated founder of the\n\nDesert Lion Conservation Project, Philip Stander, who tracks the movement of Namibia's special desert-adapted lions.He suggested that a group of five brothers named the 'Musketeers' \u2013 stars of the 2015 National Geographic film\n\nVanishing Kings: Lions of the Namib\n\n\u2013 may have been responsible.This donkey met the Musketeers. Sian Sullivan, Author providedA few days later I encountered the Musketeers, close to Namibia's spectacular Skeleton Coast, while recording memories of places previously inhabited by Ganaseb's brother Noag, and their cousin Franz ||H\u00f6eb (the two lines signify a 'click consonant' in Khoe-languages).\nThey claimed that in the past people did not have problems with \"wild animals\" \u2013 they would simply ask them nicely to move, so that the people could be on their way.Some elderly Khoe-speaking people continue to practice these rituals, asking both known ancestors and anonymous spirits of the dead to protect them from lions. Whimsical perhaps, but these narratives illustrate variety in local experiences of lions.Less than a year later, on 9 August 2016, three of the Musketeers were killed in Purros Conservancy by poison set by cattle farmers. These lions had been troubling people for some time. The radio collars that tracked their movements were burnt. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">Tragically, only days earlier Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism had approved the transport of these three lions and their remaining brother to a national park where they would be kept apart from farmers and their livestock.\nBut as the three lions returned from unreachable mountainous areas they encountered a cattle-post, where they slaughtered a donkey and whose poisoned flesh later killed them. The ministry is seeking criminal charges.Although one of the worst cases, this is only the latest in a series of recent conflicts between humans and lions in the area. In June 2016, a lioness was shot dead after a bull was killed by a pride of lions near the settlement of Otjindakui.Earlier that month, the first Musketeer to be killed died from a bullet wound near a temporary cattle-post in the region.Conflict is inevitableThese incidents reflect recent expansion in lion distribution in Namibia's Kunene region. A result is economic damage, borne disproportionately by unlucky farmers.Compensation, when received, may not cover the cost of a lost cow or bull. As such, increasing lion numbers cause tour guides to celebrate while locals are dismayed.\nClashes between humans and lions in a region celebrated by tourists and conservationists have encouraged significant investment in addressing human-wildlife conflict.Community game guards were established in the early 1980s, beginning a widely praised model of \"community-based natural resources management\"\n\nfinanced by donors including the WWF and the US and UK international aid departments.The kraal and tent of a lone Herero herder whose donkey was killed by lions. Sian Sullivan, Author providedSince 1996 indigenous Namibians have been able to legally derive incomes from wildlife in recognised territories managed as \"conservancies\".The vision is that this income will increase the value of indigenous fauna and flora as economically-productive resources, countering the costs to other livelihood activities of sharing land with wildlife whilst offering routes towards rural development.\nThe success of these conservancies, combined until recently with favourable wetter climatic conditions since the mid-1990s, has led to increasing lion populations.Efforts to smooth over resulting tensions with local people include a compensation scheme for herders paid for by safari operators; a community 'lion task force' and 'lion rangers'\n\nwho monitor lion movements and advise herders when to move away; lion proof kraals (cattle pens); and bright lights, ultra-sound, and fireworks to discourage lions from approaching settlements.These initiatives do much to mitigate the conflict. But current drought is causing herders to overlap with lion, the former seeking dispersed grazing, the latter dispersed prey animals.Expanding tourism has encouraged lions to become more confident around humans. And prey animals like zebra and antelope already affected by drought may be reduced further by shoot-to-sell policies, whereby conservancies sell rights to outside contractors to shoot animals to supply butcheries elsewhere.Different strokes for different folks?Human-lion conflicts can also act as a flash-point for other frustrations. Livestock herders in communal areas are experiencing punitive measures for trying to protect their animals in a context of historical land appropriation that squeezed indigenous Namibians into less productive landscapes.Namibia's commercial (and still largely white-owned) farming areas sometimes experience lion attacks but benefited historically from significant clearance of major predators. One celebrated former warden of Etosha National Park killed 75 lions to help farmers protect their cattle, before being employed in conservation in 1958.Today, wealthy visitors from afar hunt 'game' animals as trophies, including the occasional lion. Many conservancies are financed significantly by trophy-hunting and tourism, and some local people succeed as hunting and tourism professionals.But these benefits aren't evenly distributed, and can cause distrust over new inequalities linked with conservancy management and private sector investments.All these factors contribute to the intractable nature of the human-lion conflict. This problem is not about to disappear. At the same time, local people with different histories have different ideas about how to live with lions.Learning more about positive stories of how people lived with predators in the past may yet help people and lions to live alongside each other into the future.Sian Sullivan, Professor of Environment and Culture, Bath Spa UniversityThis article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

        "a": "Title: Study Reveals Insights into Middle Miocene Climate Optimum and Implications for Future Global Warming\n\nA recent study published in a scientific journal has shed light on the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO), a significant global warming event that occurred approximately 15 million years ago. The research, conducted by a team of scientists using proxy data and advanced climate models, indicates that during the MMCO, the global annual mean surface temperature was 18.4\u00b0C, which is about 3\u00b0C higher than present-day temperatures and equivalent to the warming predicted for the next century.\n\nThe study utilized the latest National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model CAM3.1 and Land Model CLM3.0 coupled to a slab ocean to investigate the sensitivity of the MMCO climate to varying ocean heat fluxes derived from paleo sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The researchers incorporated detailed reconstructions of Middle Miocene boundary conditions, including paleogeography, elevation, vegetation, and surface temperatures, into their models.\n\nThe findings suggest that in order to maintain the warmth observed during the MMCO, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration would have needed to be approximately 460\u2013580 parts per million by volume (ppmv). This range is narrower than the previously estimated 300\u2013600 ppmv. The study highlights the importance of considering various factors, such as ocean heat fluxes and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, in understanding past climate events and predicting future global warming scenarios.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as it provides valuable insights into how the Earth's climate system responded to natural warming events in the past and offers a basis for predicting potential temperature increases in the future. By refining our understanding of the MMCO and its associated climate conditions, scientists can better assess the potential impacts of ongoing climate change and inform strategies for mitigating its effects.\n\nFurther research in this area is crucial for advancing our knowledge of past climate variations and improving climate models to accurately predict future climate trends. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between paleoclimatologists, climate modelers, and other experts to unravel the complexities of Earth's climate system and address the challenges posed by global warming.",
        "b": "This article was written by Emma Stone and Alex Farnsworth from the University of Bristol, and was originally published by The Conversation.It's official: 2015 was the warmest year on record. But those global temperature records only date back to 1850 and become increasingly uncertain the further back you go. Beyond then, we're reliant on signs left behind in tree rings, ice cores or rocks. So when was Earth last warmer than the present?\nThe Medieval Warm Period is often cited as the answer. This spell, beginning in roughly 950AD and lasting for three centuries, saw major changes to population centres across the globe. This included the collapse of the Tiwanaku civilisation in South America due to increased aridity, and the colonisation of Greenland by the Vikings.But that doesn't tell the whole story. Yes, some regions were warmer than in recent years, but others were substantially colder. Across the globe, averaged temperatures then were in fact cooler than today.To reach a point when Earth was significantly warmer than today we'd need to go back 130,000 years, to a time known as the Eemian.\n\nFor about 1.8 million years the planet had fluctuated between a series of ice ages and warmer periods known as 'interglacials'. The Eemian, which lasted around 15,000 years, was the most recent of these interglacials (before the one we're currently in).Although global annual average temperatures were approximately 1 to 2\u02daC warmer than preindustrial levels, high latitude regions were several degrees warmer still. This meant ice caps melted, Greenland's ice sheet was reduced and the West Antarctic ice sheet may have collapsed. The sea level was at least 6 m higher than today.\nAcross Asia and North America forests extended much further north than today and straight-tusked elephants (now extinct) and hippopotamuses were living as far north as the British Isles.How do we know all this? Well, scientists can estimate the temperature changes at this time by looking at chemicals found in ice cores and marine sediment cores and studying pollen buried in layers deep underground. Certain isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in ice cores can determine the temperature in the past while pollen tells us which plant species were present and therefore gives us an indication of climatic conditions suitable for that species.We know from air bubbles in ice cores drilled on Antarctica that greenhouse gas concentrations in the Eemian were not dissimilar to preindustrial levels. However orbital conditions were very different \u2013 essentially there were much larger latitudinal and seasonal variations in the amount of solar energy received by Earth.So although the Eemian was warmer than today the driving mechanism for this warmth was fundamentally different to present-day climate change, which is down to greenhouses gases. To find a warm period caused predominantly by conditions more similar to today, we need to go even further back in time.Glen Fergus/WikimediaAs climate scientists, we're particularly interested in the Miocene (around 23 to 5.3 million years ago), and in particular a spell known as the Miocene-Climate Optimum (11-17 million years ago). Around this time CO2\n\nvalues (350-400 parts per million) were similar to today and it therefore potentially serves as an appropriate analogue for the future.\nDuring the Optimum, those carbon dioxide concentrations were the predominant driver of climate change. Global average temperatures were 2 to 4\u02daC warmer than preindustrial values, sea level was around 20 m higher and there was an expansion of tropical vegetation.However, during the later Miocene period CO2\n\ndeclined to below preindustrial levels, but global temperatures remained significantly warmer. What kept things warm, if not CO2? We still don't know exactly - it may have been orbital shifts, the development of modern ocean circulation or even big geographical changes such as the Isthmus of Panama narrowing and eventually closing off\n\n- but it does mean direct comparison with the present day is problematic.Currently orbital conditions are suitable to trigger the next glacial inception. We're due another ice age. However, as pointed out in a recent study in Nature, there's now so much carbon in the atmosphere the likelihood of this occurring is massively reduced over the next 100,000 years.Emma Stone, Research Associate in Climatology, University of Bristol and Alex Farnsworth, Postdoctoral Researcher in Climatology, University of Bristol.This article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

        "a": "For new mothers, eating their own (and child's) placenta has become a popular trend in the US and other western societies. And while it may seem unnecessarily gross, advocates of the practice \u2013 called placentophagy \u2013 claim a wide range of benefits, from protecting against postpartum depression to increasing milk production.\nBut just as the practice is becoming more common, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning new mothers that placentophagy may put newborns at risk of infectious bacteria.In theory, eating placenta makes sense. Placenta is chock-a-block full of essential vitamins, minerals, nutrients and postpartum hormones. But that doesn't necessarily mean that consuming it is beneficial.Proponents often cite how common placentophagy is among other mammals, but practically no studies have explored the effects of this practice on humans. And the few studies that do exist provide no conclusive evidence that eating your own placenta is beneficial. \n\n \n\nFor instance, a study last year found that consuming placenta does not significantly improve the iron levels of new mothers, at least no more than other iron-rich foods, such as beef.\nSo, if eating your own placenta may or may not be beneficial, why not still give it a go?Well, turns out it could risk the health of your newborn.A new case report published by the CDC warns mothers their placenta supplements may be contaminated with infectious pathogens. \n\nThe report follows a mother in Oregon, who gave birth to a healthy baby in September of last year. A couple of days later, the infant was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit and was successfully treated for a life-threatening blood infection called late-onset group B Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) bacteremia.\n\nFlash-forward five days, and the infant is back in hospital with a second case of GBS\n\n\u2013\n\na recurring infection.The doctors were stumped. That is, until they discovered the mother was taking placenta pills that were packed not only with placenta powder, but also with GBS.\nGBS doesn't usually cause infections in adults, but in a newborn's undeveloped immune system it can be treacherous.The strain that the researchers found in the Oregon case was particularly virulent, allowing it to flood the baby's intestines, bloodstream, and potentially their blood brain barrier.After running some labs, the researchers found the GBS strains in the pill were genetically identical to the GBS infection in the newborn.This suggests the placenta capsules may have elevated the mother's GBS colony in her own intestine and/or skin, making it easier for the infection to then spread to the infant. \n\nCurrently, there are no existing standards for processing placenta for consumption.\n\n And the researchers of the CDC report believe this may be why the mother's placenta pills were contaminated.\nThe company that the mother had hired to make her placenta pills \u2013 unnamed by the CDC\n\n\u2013 had dehydrated her placenta at 46 \u2013 71\u00b0C (115 \u2013 160\u00b0F), before placing the powder into a couple hundred gelatin capsules.\n\nThe researchers theorise that this company's dehydration process may not heat the placenta long enough or at a high enough temperature to kill all pathogens present.\"The placenta encapsulation process does not per se eradicate infectious pathogens; thus, placenta capsule ingestion should be avoided,\" the researchers conclude.\"Clinicians should inquire about a history of placenta ingestion in cases of late-onset GBS infection and educate mothers interested in placenta encapsulation about the potential risks.\"Until further research is conducted and more stringent standards for processing placenta are put into place, this is a practice that should probably be avoided",
        "b": "Title: The Growing Trend of Placentophagy Among Middle-Class Women: A Call for Research\n\nPlacentophagy, the practice of consuming the placenta after childbirth, has gained popularity among middle-class white women in Western societies. While the reasons for engaging in placentophagy vary, it is often promoted as a way to help postpartum women stabilize mood, enhance recovery, and increase milk production. Despite its increasing prevalence, there is a lack of scientific studies exploring the effects of placentophagy on humans.\n\nResearchers have highlighted the need for studies examining the effects of human placentophagy, but before delving into this research, several methodological issues must be addressed. A recent review has delved into existing research on the effects of placentophagy in both animals and humans, shedding light on the theoretical assumptions behind this practice and its potential effects.\n\nThe review also clarifies methodological issues related to placentophagy research and examines existing research on the nutritional and hormonal components of the placenta and their potential effects on milk production and postpartum depression. While animal studies have provided some insights into the potential benefits of placentophagy, the effects on humans remain largely unexplored.\n\nAs the trend of placentophagy continues to grow, there is a pressing need for rigorous scientific research to understand its potential effects on postpartum women. By addressing methodological issues and building upon existing knowledge, future studies can provide valuable insights into the implications of placentophagy on maternal health and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the review calls for further research on the effects of placentophagy in humans, emphasizing the importance of methodological rigor and the need to explore the potential benefits and risks associated with this practice. By advancing our understanding of placentophagy, researchers can provide evidence-based recommendations for postpartum care and support for women considering this practice.",

Although the eggs were initially discarded, the females were later relocated to new aquarium facilities in Golden Gate Park, where they continued to lay egg cases at a rapid rate.\n\nInterestingly, the exhibit where the females were housed only contained female blacktip reef sharks and a male Javanese cownose ray, making successful reproduction between the male ray and the female bamboo shark highly improbable due to their phylogenetic distance. Despite this, the females started producing up to six egg cases per week, leading to the eventual hatching of a pup in January 2012.\n\nThe researchers faced a mystery regarding the origin of the pup, considering the prolonged isolation of the females from males. Two hypotheses were proposed to explain the birth: long-term sperm storage by one of the female bamboo sharks or facultative parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction previously demonstrated in closely related shark species.\n\nThis unprecedented case of sperm storage in a female bamboo shark not only expands our understanding of shark reproductive biology but also highlights the remarkable adaptability of these animals in unique environmental conditions. Further research into the mechanisms behind long-term sperm storage and alternative reproductive strategies in sharks could provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history and conservation of these ancient marine species.",

This innovative technique opens up new possibilities for manipulating and studying objects in a non-contact manner.\n\nThe research team was able to achieve acoustic levitation of a 50mm expanded polystyrene sphere, which is approximately 3.6 times the wavelength, by employing three 25kHz ultrasonic transducers arranged in a tripod configuration. By creating a standing wave between the transducers and the sphere, the researchers were able to generate an axial acoustic radiation force that effectively lifted the sphere.\n\nTo validate their findings, the scientists numerically modeled the acoustic radiation force exerted by each transducer on the sphere as a function of the distance between them. This theoretical model was then put to the test in an experimental setup that included an electronic scale and an ultrasonic transducer mounted on a motorized linear stage. The comparison between the numerical and experimental results showed a high level of agreement, confirming the effectiveness of the acoustic levitation technique.\n\nThis research represents a significant advancement in the field of acoustic levitation, as it demonstrates the feasibility of levitating objects much larger than the acoustic wavelength. The ability to manipulate objects using acoustic waves without physical contact has wide-ranging applications, from material handling in industrial processes to the study of biological samples in a controlled environment.\n\nThe successful levitation of large spherical objects using acoustic waves paves the way for further exploration and development of this technology, with potential implications for various scientific and industrial fields.

These standing waves have peaks that oscillate between high and low pressure, and can be used to bounce and jostle an object up against the force of gravity.Usually this is done with two opposing sound waves, and water droplets or tiny polystyrene balls smaller than the acoustic wavelength.The traditional technique is to trap the object in the pressure node - the sweet spot where the pressure of the standing wave doesn't change at all - so that the standing wave below the object works like a ping pong paddle, constantly hitting the object upwards.But this is the first time acoustic levitation has been done with a sphere that's 3.6 times larger than the acoustic wavelength, and has a mass of around 1.5 grams.Andrade et al./AIP PublishingUsing the traditional technique, it was thought that the maximum sized object that could be levitated using ultrasound waves, which have a frequency about 20 kHz and a wavelength of 14 mm, was around 4 mm in diameter.\n\"In our paper, we demonstrate that we can combine multiple ultrasonic transducers\n\nto levitate an object significantly larger than the acoustic wavelength,\" one of the researchers, Marco Andrade from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, told Lisa Zyga over at Phys.org.\"We could increase the maximum object size from one quarter of the wavelength to 50 mm, which is approximately 3.6 times the acoustic wavelength.\"To pull this off, the team used a tripod structure of ultrasound transducers.Instead of trapping the object at the pressure node - the ping pong bat method isn't powerful enough to levitate something this large - the team generated a standing wave between the transducers and the object. This meant the sphere was being buffered on three sides by sounds waves to hold it in place.\nUsing this technique, they were able to levitate the sphere to a height of around 7 mm, which is approximately half the wavelength of acoustic waves.But the researchers hope that by tweaking their technique, they'll be able to get objects higher - and also levitate larger objects at different angles.\"At the moment, we can only levitate the object at a fixed position in space,\" Andrade told Phys.org. \"In future work, we would like to develop new devices capable of levitating and manipulating large objects in air.\"Acoustic levitation could play an important role in the future to analyse and control liquid in space, as well as helping researchers handle extremely hot or caustic materials here on Earth.It could also help researchers to one day generate Star Trek-style\n\ntractor beam devices, that can pull an object towards them.\nMore importantly for now, it just looks really, really cool. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">For even more acoustic levitation on the small scale, check this out: width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">The research has been\n\npublished in\n\nApplied Physics Letter",

The study, published in a leading scientific journal, details the innovative design and capabilities of this cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe WTNG incorporates a silver-coated textile and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanopatterns based on ZnO nanorod arrays on a Ag-coated textile template as active triboelectric materials. Impressively, the nanopatterned PDMS-based WTNG demonstrated a high output voltage of approximately 120 V and a current of 65 \u03bcA, surpassing the performance of non-nanopatterned flat PDMS-based WTNG which yielded an output voltage of 30 V and a current of 20 \u03bcA under the same compressive force of 10 kgf.\n\nMoreover, the researchers observed remarkable voltage and current outputs averaging 170 V and 120 \u03bcA, respectively, from a four-layer-stacked WTNG under the same compressive force. Significantly, the multilayer-stacked WTNG exhibited consistent output voltages over 12,000 cycles, highlighting its exceptional mechanical durability.\n\nOne of the most striking applications of this technology is its ability to power electronic devices autonomously.

It's also known as contact electrification, which means you can render certain types of materials electrically charged by rubbing them against another type of surface. If you get the right combination of materials, just a small amount of fiction is all that's needed to convert mechanical energy into usable electricity.The triboelectric effect works when you rub materials together and they form a chemical bond known as adhesion. Thanks to this bond, electrons are freely transferred from one material to the other, creating a build-up of positive charge in one, and a negative charge in the other. When the bond between the two materials is broken, an electric voltage is generated.With this in mind, a team led by materials scientist Sang-Woo Kim from Sungkyunkwan University have invented a double-layer fabric made from woven fibres with one layer coated in silver and the other layer coated in minuscule zinc oxide nanorods that have been dipped in polydimethylsiloxane.\n\nAs Prachi Patel explains at Chemical & Engineering News, these nanorods help to increase the contact surface area between the two layers, which means a better output of friction, and more voltage. \"When the researchers compressed a 4-cm by 4-cm patch of the two-layer textile with a 98-Newton force and then released it, the fabric generated 120 V and a 65-\u00b5amp current,\"\n\nsays Patel. \"To increase the power output, the team stacked four triboelectric generators to make a device that put out 170 V and 120 \u00b5amp.

When the team asked a volunteer to put it on, all he had to do was move his arm and/or wrist to generate enough charge to power up each of those small devices, one at a time, without any help from external power sources.\n\nThis \"proves potential applications of WTNGs in self-powered smart clothes, health care monitoring and self-powered wearable devices, and even personal electronics\", the team concludes in the journal ACS Nano.\n\nThe technology is cheap to use and make, and will probably be more feasible than embedding solar cells into our clothes for the sam effect, says Patel at Chemical & Engineering News.

Traditionally, the rate capability of these materials has been limited by solid-state diffusion, prompting the use of nanostructured materials to reduce ion diffusion distances. However, a new approach involving the presence of structural water in layered transition metal oxides has shown remarkable promise in improving energy storage performance.\n\nThe study focused on comparing the electrochemical energy storage behavior of a model hydrated layered oxide, WO3\u00b72H2O, with that of anhydrous WO3 in an acidic electrolyte. The researchers discovered that the presence of structural water in WO3\u00b72H2O resulted in a transition from battery-like behavior in anhydrous WO3 to ideally pseudocapacitive behavior. This transition led to significantly improved capacity retention and energy efficiency for proton storage, particularly at high sweep rates of up to 200 mV s\u20131, corresponding to charge/discharge times of just a few seconds.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was that WO3\u00b72H2O exhibited nearly 100% energy efficiency at fast sweep rates, unlike anhydrous WO3. The pseudocapacitance observed in WO3\u00b72H2O allowed for the development of high-mass loading electrodes (>3 mg cm\u20132) and high areal capacitances (>0.25 F cm\u20132 at 200 mV s\u20131) using simple slurry-cast electrodes. These results highlight the potential of harnessing structural water in layered transition metal oxides as a new approach for high-power energy storage applications.\n\nThe researchers emphasized the importance of energy efficiency as a metric for evaluating the performance of pseudocapacitive materials. The findings of this study not only offer insights into improving the kinetics of energy storage in transition metal oxides but also pave the way for the development of high-performance energy storage devices with enhanced power capabilities.\n\nThis innovative approach opens up new possibilities for advancing energy storage technologies and underscores the significance of exploring unconventional strategies to overcome existing limitations in material design.

This discovery sheds light on the technological advancements of early humans and their adaptation to new environments as they dispersed across the globe.\n\nThe antiquity of this ground-edge axe aligns with the arrival of humans on the Australian landmass, suggesting that these tools were developed or introduced shortly after humans reached the continent.

The impact, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago, is widely believed to have triggered a mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and many other species.\n\nThe study, led by a team of researchers, challenges the idea that the global debris layer created by the Chicxulub impact contained enough soot to indicate that the entire terrestrial biosphere had burned. Previous modeling suggested that the reentry of ejecta from the impact would have caused a global infrared (IR) pulse, igniting global fires within a few hours of the impact.\n\nHowever, the new study argues that the absence of charcoal and the presence of noncharred organic matter in the debris layer are inconsistent with the idea of global fires causing the extinctions. The researchers suggest that the soot in the debris layer may have originated from the impact site itself, rather than from a global firestorm.\n\nThe study also challenges the assertion that the apparent charcoal depletion in the Cretaceous-Paleogene layer was due to global fires. The researchers argue that sediment deposition rates were not properly accounted for, leading to a misinterpretation of the data.\n\nDespite these challenges to previous theories, the researchers maintain that global firestorms are consistent with both data and physical modeling. They suggest that the mass of soot potentially released from the impact site is far too low to explain the observed soot in the debris layer.\n\nThis new study highlights the complexity of understanding the effects of the Chicxulub impact on the Earth's biosphere and the importance of reevaluating long-standing theories in light of new evidence.

This engineered membrane allows for the exchange of metabolites, energy, and inhibitory species between parallel \"reactor\" and \"feeder\" channels, thereby optimizing the production process.\n\nMoreover, the membrane can be modified using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition to fine-tune the exchange rate of small molecules. This customization enables extended reaction times and improved yields, surpassing the capabilities of conventional tube-based batch formats.\n\nThe study demonstrates that the microscale bioreactor design not only enhances protein yields but also retains the reaction product and higher molecular weight components of the transcription/translation machinery within the reactor channel. By facilitating small molecule exchange within the dual-channel bioreactor, the researchers have achieved dramatic improvements in product yields.\n\nOverall, this innovative microfluidic bioreactor holds great promise for advancing the field of protein synthesis, particularly in the context of point-of-care applications. The ability to produce therapeutic proteins efficiently and effectively in a small footprint device could have far-reaching implications for personalized medicine and rapid drug development.\n\nAs researchers continue to refine and optimize this technology, the future looks bright for the production of complex proteins and biologics using cell-free synthesis methods. The integration of microfluidic bioreactors into point-of-care settings could pave the way for a new era of precision medicine and on-demand protein production.",

        "a": "Title: Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Shows Promise in Treating Recurrent Hepatic Encephalopathy\n\nA groundbreaking study has shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a carefully selected donor could be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. The research, published in a recent issue of a scientific journal, highlights the potential of FMT in improving microbial dysbiosis and reducing hospital readmissions associated with HE.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy is a serious neurological disorder that occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis, leading to cognitive impairment and other debilitating symptoms. Despite current standard of care treatments, recurrent HE remains a significant challenge, often resulting in repeated hospitalizations.\n\nIn the study, researchers conducted an open-label randomized clinical trial involving outpatient men with cirrhosis who had recurrent HE despite receiving standard treatments. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either FMT in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The FMT group underwent a regimen of broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by a single FMT enema from a donor with optimal microbiota composition.\n\nThe primary outcome of the study was to assess the safety of FMT compared to standard care, with a focus on FMT-related serious adverse events. The results showed that FMT was well tolerated, with significantly fewer serious adverse events in the FMT group compared to the standard care group. Additionally, fewer FMT participants experienced further episodes of HE, indicating a potential benefit of FMT in preventing disease progression.\n\nFurthermore, cognitive function improved in the FMT group, while no significant changes were observed in the standard care group. Analysis of microbial composition revealed that FMT led to an increase in microbial diversity and beneficial taxa, which are associated with improved gut health. In contrast, standard care did not show significant changes in microbial composition or disease severity.\n\nOverall, the study concluded that FMT from a carefully selected donor could reduce hospitalizations, improve cognitive function, and restore microbial balance in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent HE. These findings suggest that FMT may offer a promising new approach to managing this challenging condition and improving patient outcomes.\n\nFurther research is needed to confirm these results and explore the long-term effects of FMT in treating recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. However, this study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of harnessing the gut microbiome to address complex liver-related disorders.",
        "b": "The intriguing, yet somewhat malodorous, topic of poo transplants is in the news. A study published today found poo transplants are better at treating a particular type of diarrhoea than an antibiotic or placebo (a fake or dummy treatment).\nThe study collated and analysed the results from earlier studies in how effective poo transplants were in treating diarrhoea caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile.Researchers have been interested in alternative treatments for this condition due to the rise in resistance to standard treatments (including antibiotics). So this type of diarrhoea has quickly developed into a more life-threatening disease.The study findings are in line with recent European advice strongly encouraging setting up centres specialising in poo transplants to treat C. difficile diarrhoea.Despite the apparent success of poo transplants for this particular condition, there is still much we don't know about this therapy. It's important to figure out how long the effects last, and which bugs in the poo transplant help us cure disease and which don't t.\nHow do poo transplants work?Poo transplants (or \"faecal microbiota transplantation\") involve transferring poo from a healthy donor to a sick recipient. The collective community of bugs and compounds (the gut microbiota) in the donor's poo is then believed to establish itself in the recipient's gut.The scientific consensus is poo transplants work if the recipient's gut microbiota is \"restored\". The most consistent measure of this has been an increase in the diversity of the community of organisms in the recipient's gut.By encouraging a more diverse and beneficial community of organisms in the gut, the idea is that this allows the recipient to resist being overwhelmed by the \"bad\" bugs. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">Before donating their poo, donors' poo and their blood is screened for many infectious agents such as C. difficile, HIV and viral hepatitis (A, B and C). This is to make sure a donation doesn't transfer pathogens (disease causing microorganisms) by accident.\nThe screened donor poo is then delivered to the recipient in a number of ways.Delivery methods from above involve recipients swallowing a poo capsule (or \"crapsule\") containing frozen poo. Alternatively, a diluted sample can be delivered through a plastic tube inserted into the nose down to the stomach or small bowel (nasogastric intubation).Samples can also be delivered from below via colonoscopy, where a tube is inserted into the rectum and goes deep into the gut to the caecum (just above the appendix). Or recipients can have an enema, where fluid is infused through the rectum.What works?Poo transplants made their way into the medical literature a long time ago with the first successful result in 1958. Interest in poo transplants was ignited in 1989, in Australia, when various conditions including irritable bowel syndrome responded to therapy.\nHowever, it was not until 2013 that the first controlled trial for C. difficile diarrhoea was carried out, which showed the treatment was better than antibiotics and placebo.The trial was stopped early as the ethics committee considered it unethical to withhold this therapy from the control group. The research out today backs these findings.There is also evidence that poo transplants may be beneficial for patients suffering from the gut conditions colitis and Crohn's disease, a range of infectious or inflammatory liver conditions, and in eliminating antibiotic-resistant bacteria from recipients' guts.Preliminary studies also suggest benefit for coeliac disease (in a single person), irritable bowel syndrome (in mice), and for bowel and behavioural symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorders (this was a small study",

Same finding: Nonusers rated themselves as more stressed out than the chronic marijuana users.The heavy users, in other words, reacted to a stressful situation with equanimity and chill even though they weren't stoned at the time of the test.There's an outside chance that some of this effect could be due to self-selection: Perhaps naturally relaxed people are more inclined to become frequent cannabis users?But the effects were observed in a controlled laboratory experiment, making the causal link much stronger than it would have been if the researchers had just relied on, say, pre-existing survey data.This is somewhat unsurprising:\n\nSurveys show that \"relaxation\"\n\nis the No. 1 reason cited by marijuana users for why pot is their drug of choice.\nThis research confirms that they're probably not just deluding themselves and that over the long term, marijuana use does perhaps lead to a somewhat more relaxed outlook on life.But, as the researchers note, this can be a double-edged sword. Stress is an adaptive response to potentially dangerous or harmful situations.Dampening that response in otherwise healthy individuals may have unintended consequences: Prior research has shown links between unbalanced\n\ncortisol levels and\n\nPTSD\n\nand\n\ndepression, for instance.On the other hand, stress\n\nand anxiety can be debilitating conditions in and of themselves.

This suggests that alterations in glucocorticoid levels before experiencing trauma could influence the development of PTSD and its associated biological changes.\n\nThe study also highlights recent findings indicating that pretraumatic glucocorticoid alterations may be influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and other environmental factors. These factors could potentially increase the susceptibility to developing PTSD after exposure to trauma and modulate the biological changes linked to the disorder's pathophysiology.\n\nResearchers in the field of PTSD are currently using glucocorticoid challenge strategies to investigate the effects of externally administered glucocorticoids on neuroendocrine, cognitive, and brain function. The results of these studies have provided valuable insights into the potential use of glucocorticoid-based strategies in the treatment of PTSD.\n\nThese findings offer a deeper understanding of the role of glucocorticoids in PTSD and suggest that targeting glucocorticoid pathways could be a promising approach in developing new treatments for individuals suffering from this debilitating disorder. Further research in this area could lead to more effective therapeutic interventions that address the underlying biological mechanisms of PTSD.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as they pave the way for novel treatment strategies that could potentially improve the lives of individuals affected by PTSD.

This system is unique in that it consists of a primary lens mass of approximately 4 Jupiter masses hosting a sub-Earth mass moon.\n\nThe argument for the presence of an exomoon in this system is based on its relatively close proximity to the Sun. The data collected constrain the product of the lens system mass and the lens-source relative parallax, suggesting that if the lens system is nearby, the companion is likely a sub-Earth-mass exomoon.\n\nThe best-fit solution for this system indicates a large lens-source relative proper motion, which would typically rule out a distant lens system unless the source star exhibits an unusually high proper motion. However, data from the OGLE collaboration have nearly ruled out a high source proper motion, making the exoplanet-exomoon model the favored interpretation for the best-fit model.\n\nDespite this, an alternate solution with a lower proper motion that fits the data almost as well has been identified. This solution is compatible with a distant, stellar host. A Bayesian analysis does not strongly support the exoplanet-exomoon interpretation, leading to Occam's razor favoring a lens system in the bulge with host and companion masses of 0.12M and 18M, respectively, at a projected separation of 0.84 AU.\n\nThe presence of this degeneracy in the data is considered an unfortunate coincidence, highlighting the challenges in interpreting microlensing data. However, the study suggests that current microlensing experiments have the potential to detect exomoons under certain circumstances, and future experiments may provide further insights into these intriguing celestial bodies.\n\nThis discovery opens up new possibilities for studying exoplanet-exomoon systems and understanding the dynamics of these complex planetary systems. With continued advancements in technology and observational techniques, scientists hope to definitively establish the mass of such lens systems through the microlensing parallax effect, paving the way for further discoveries in the field of exoplanetary science.",

The current hypothesis is that the vast gravitational pull of Kepler-1625b pulled the moon Kepler-1625 I into orbit at some point in time.The next stage is to take further readings using the Hubble telescope in October, which should help confirm whether or not we're looking at an exomoon.This is about more than just ticking an exomoon box: as we've seen with Saturn's moons in our own Solar System, these rocky objects could well have conditions that are more habitable than the planets they're orbiting.

By combining a detailed international trade database with accounts tracking what goods and services tourists bought, we identified carbon flows between 160 countries from 2009 to 2013.Our results show that tourism-related emissions increased by around 15 percent over that period, from 3.9 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon-dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082-e) to 4.5Gt.\nThis rise primarily came from tourist spending on transport, shopping and food.(Arunima Malik/Ya-Yen Sun)We estimate that our growing appetite for travel and a business-as-usual scenario would increase carbon emissions from global tourism to about 6.5Gt by 2025.This increase is largely driven by rising incomes, making tourism highly income-elastic and carbon-intensive.Whose responsibility is it?In the study, we compared two perspectives for allocating responsibility for these emissions: residence-based accounting and destination-based accounting. The former perspective allocates emissions to the country of residence of tourists, the latter to the country of destination.\nPut simply, are tourism-related carbon emissions the responsibility of travellers or tourist destinations?If responsibility lies with the travellers, then we should identify the countries that send the most tourists out into the world, and find ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their travel.On the other hand, destination-based accounting can offer insights into tourism spots (like popular islands) that would benefit most from technology improvements and regulations for reducing the carbon footprint of tourism.Tracking emissions under destination-based accounting over a specific period could help researchers and policymakers to answer questions about the success of incentive schemes and regulations, and to assess the speed of decarbonisation of tourism-related sectors.So how do countries rank under the two accounting perspectives?\nThe United States is responsible for the majority of tourism-related emissions under both perspectives - many people travel both from and to the US - followed by China, Germany and India.But on a per-capita basis, the situation looks rather different.

The study delves into the mechanisms of DNA damage and repair, shedding light on how damaged cells may evade critical checkpoints, leading to the development of cancer.\n\nThe research highlights that the identification and repair of DNA damage are crucial processes that efficiently manage potential mutations. However, if damaged cells manage to bypass checkpoints that assess genome integrity and regulate cell cycle progression, they may continue to divide unchecked, ultimately leading to the development of cancer.\n\nAccording to the study, a set of larger checkpoints operates on a progressively increasing scale to ward off the sequence-altering effects of DNA damage throughout an individual's life or the lifespan of a species. These checkpoints play a vital role in safeguarding genetic integrity, diversity, and ultimately, the survival of the species and life on Earth.\n\nThe researchers propose that cancer may represent the final checkpoint in nature's design, preventing complex organisms from living indefinitely at the expense of genetic stagnation.

The idea behind the paper is based on the fact that, in the healthy body, there are a whole range of inbuilt safeguards, or 'checkpoints', that stop DNA mutations from being passed onto new cells.One of the most important of these checkpoints is apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Whenever DNA is damaged and can't be fixed, cells are marked for apoptosis, and are quickly digested by the immune system - effectively 'swallowing' the problem. No mess, no fuss.But the new hypothesis suggests that when apoptosis - and the other safeguards - don't work like they're supposed to, cancer just might be the final 'checkpoint' that steps in and gets rid of the rogue cells before their DNA can be passed on\u2026 by, uh, killing us, and removing our genetic material from the gene pool.\n\"Dividing cells have to be able to pass at least four crucially important checkpoints during different phases of the cell cycle,\" the researchers write in the paper, published in Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment.Most of these four stages, like apoptosis, are checking for DNA damage, but they can occasionally miss things, and when they do, it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, and eventually cancer. Unchecked, the researchers say, those DNA mutations could eventually be passed on - if the carrier isn't killed first.It sounds like something out of a particularly brutal sci-fi plot, but the authors of the paper - Rumena Petkova and Stoyan Chakarov from the Scientific Technology Service and Sofia University in Bulgaria - defend their idea by explaining that old age is pretty much a similar mechanism. After all, the planet couldn't survive if we all lived forever.\n\n\"[Cancer] seems to be a key evolution mechanism similar to DNA repair and apoptosis that protects the life on Earth as we know it from being extinguished \u2026 a kind of a supreme checkpoint to ensure replacement of generations and evolution on planet Earth,\" they explai",

        "a": "Scientists have broken the world\n\nrecord for optical data transfer, beaming what's called 'twisted light' over a distance of 143 kilometres (almost 90 miles).If you're scratching your head over what twisted light is, it's actually exactly what it sounds like: a beam of light where the particles aren't all travelling forward in a linear block, but are twisting as they go, like a corkscrew through the air.\nThe new milestone represents\n\na 50-fold improvement\n\non the previous record, according to researchers from the University of Vienna in Austria, and while they're not ready for real-world applications yet, these twisted beams of light could one day be used to send large volumes of data at blisteringly high speeds.Also called an\n\noptical vortex, twisted light could improve current fibre optic technology because it allows more data to be sent simultaneously - separate channels of information could be broadcast at the same time, using different amounts of twist.Scientists are still figuring out the practicalities of how such a system would work, because right now, one problem is beaming an optical vortex without the light (and therefore the data) being scrambled along the way.One of the\n\nways\n\nwe could\n\nget around this is by using\n\nneural networks that can help to filter out transmission errors. With this kind of system, the team was able to transmit light through the air between the islands of La Palma and Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain, for a total distance of 143 kilometres (89 miles).\nThey even encoded a message in the corkscrew beam: \"Hello, world.\" Aw.Credit: University of ViennaHaving been trained using data from beams distorted by turbulence, their computer-powered neural network was able to successfully decode messages about 80 percent of the time.That figure \u2013 and the overall distance \u2013 should get higher over time, as the technology and methods are further refined. The team used a green laser beam at the sending station in La Palmer, with the resulting magnified light collected on the wall of the Observatorio del Teide in Tenerife.The experiment took 10 days in total, which means\n\nthere's clearly room for improvement, seeing as that's about as fast as a smoke signal. Still, in science, you've gotta start somewhere.\nIn the future, this kind of technology could eventually allow for high-speed data transmission between satellites and Earth's surface, the scientists say.\"We don't consider this method as real communication, but merely the demonstration of the transmission quality of modes,\" write the researchers. \"However, the application of state-of-the-art adaptive optics such as those used in simple and efficient intensity-based methods could further improve the link quality.\"A paper detailing the research has been\n\npublished on pre-print website arXiv.org,\n\nis currently awaiting\n\npeer-revie",

This remarkable feat, reported in a recent study, represents a significant advancement in the field of quantum communication and opens up new possibilities for long-distance information transfer using light modes.\n\nSpatial modes of light, such as orbital angular momentum modes, have the potential to carry a vast amount of information, making them attractive for both classical and quantum communication applications. However, the distribution of these modes over large distances has posed a significant challenge. Intermodal coupling has complicated their use with conventional fibers, while free-space transmission has been hindered by atmospheric turbulence.\n\nThe research team overcame these obstacles by successfully transmitting orbital angular momentum modes of light over a distance that is 50 times greater than the previous maximum distance achieved. To demonstrate the quality of the transmission, the researchers encoded a short message using superpositions of these modes. At the receiving end, an artificial neural network was employed to distinguish between the different twisted light superpositions.\n\nRemarkably, the algorithm used by the neural network was able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy exceeding 80% up to the third mode order. The transmitted message was decoded with an error rate of 8.33%, showcasing the effectiveness of the transmission method.\n\nBased on their findings, the researchers estimate that the distribution of orbital angular momentum entanglement over distances exceeding 100 kilometers of free space is feasible. Furthermore, they suggest that the quality of the free-space link can be further enhanced by incorporating state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems.\n\nThis achievement represents a significant step forward in the field of quantum communication, offering new possibilities for long-distance transmission of information using light modes. The successful transmission of orbital angular momentum modes over such a vast distance paves the way for future advancements in secure and efficient communication technologies based on quantum principles.",

        "a": "Homo sapiens is a very moody species. Even though sadness and bad moods have always been part of the human experience, we now live in an age that ignores or devalues these feelings.\nIn our culture, normal human emotions like temporary sadness are often treated as disorders. Manipulative advertising, marketing and self-help industries claim happiness should be ours for the asking. Yet bad moods remain an essential part of the normal range of moods we regularly experience.Despite the near-universal cult of happiness and unprecedented material wealth, happiness and life satisfaction in Western societies has not improved for decades.It's time to re-assess the role of bad moods in our lives. We should recognise they are a normal, and even a useful and adaptive part of being human, helping us cope with many everyday situations and challenges.A short history of sadnessIn earlier historical times, short spells of feeling sad or moody (known as mild dysphoria) have always been accepted as a normal part of everyday life. In fact, many of the greatest achievements of the human spirit deal with evoking, rehearsing and even cultivating negative feelings.\nGreek tragedies exposed and trained audiences to accept and deal with inevitable misfortune as a normal part of human life. Shakespeare's tragedies are classics because they echo this theme. And the works of many great artists such as Beethoven and Chopin in music, or Chekhov and Ibsen in literature explore the landscape of sadness, a theme long recognised as instructive and valuable.Ancient philosophers have also believed accepting bad moods is essential to living a full life. Even hedonist philosophers like Epicurus recognised living well involves exercising wise judgement, restraint, self-control and accepting inevitable adversity.Other philosophers like the stoics also highlighted the importance of learning to anticipate and accept misfortunes, such as loss, sorrow or injustice.What is the point of sadness?\nPsychologists who study how our feelings and behaviours have evolved over time maintain all our affective states (such as moods and emotions) have a useful role: they alert us to states of the world we need to respond to.In fact, the range of human emotions includes many more negative than positive feelings. Negative emotions such as fear, anger, shame or disgust are helpful because they help us recognise, avoid and overcome threatening or dangerous situations.But what is the point of sadness, perhaps the most common negative emotion, and one most practising psychologists deal with?Intense and enduring sadness, such as depression, is obviously a serious and debilitating disorder. However, mild, temporary bad moods may serve an important and useful adaptive purpose, by helping us to cope with everyday challenges and difficult situations.\nThey also act as a social signal that communicates disengagement, withdrawal from competition and provides a protective cover. When we appear sad or in a bad mood, people often are concerned and are inclined to help.Some negative moods, such as melancholia and nostalgia (a longing for the past) may even be pleasant and seem to provide useful information to guide future plans and motivation.Sadness can also enhance empathy, compassion, connectedness and moral and aesthetic sensibility. And sadness has long been a trigger for artistic creativity.Recent scientific experiments document the benefits of mild bad moods, which often work as automatic, unconscious alarm signals, promoting a more attentive and detailed thinking style. In other words, bad moods help us to be more attentive and focused in difficult situations.\nIn contrast, positive mood (like feeling happy) typically serves as a signal indicating familiar and safe situations and results in a less detailed and attentive processing style.Psychological benefits of sadnessThere is now growing evidence that negative moods, like sadness, has psychological benefits.To demonstrate this, researchers first manipulate people's mood (by showing happy or sad films, for example), then measure changes in performance in various cognitive and behavioural tasks.Feeling sad or in a bad mood produces a number of benefits:\nbetter memory: In one study, a bad mood (caused by bad weather) resulted in people better remembering the details of a shop they just left. Bad mood can also improve eyewitness memories by reducing the effects of various distractions, like irrelevant, false or misleading information",
        "b": "Title: Study Shows Temporary Mood Influences Communication Strategies\n\nIn a recent study published in the Journal of Communication Research, researchers investigated the impact of temporary mood on people's communication strategies. The study, based on Grice's cooperative principle, which suggests that conversational utterances should adhere to the maxims of quantity, relevance, quality, and manner, aimed to understand how mood influences communication behavior.\n\nThe researchers conducted three experiments to explore the relationship between mood and adherence to Grice's maxims. The results revealed that participants in a negative mood demonstrated better compliance with the communication norms compared to those in a positive mood when describing a previously observed social event using natural language.\n\nFurthermore, experiments 2 and 3 confirmed that mood not only influenced communication strategies but also played a role in the encoding and retrieval of relevant information. The findings supported the theory that positive affect tends to promote a more internally focused and assimilative thinking and communication style, while negative mood leads to a more externally focused and accommodative approach, resulting in closer observance of communication norms.\n\nThese results have significant implications for understanding the interplay between affect and cognition in communication. The study sheds light on how temporary mood states can impact individuals' communication styles and strategies in everyday conversations. By recognizing the influence of mood on communication behavior, individuals may be able to adapt their conversational approaches based on their emotional state.\n\nThe researchers suggest that these findings could have practical implications for improving everyday conversational strategies. By being aware of how mood can influence communication, individuals may be able to enhance their ability to effectively convey information and engage in more cooperative and meaningful interactions.\n\nOverall, this study highlights the importance of considering the role of mood in shaping communication strategies and emphasizes the need for further research to explore the complex dynamics between affect, cognition, and communication behavior.",

        "a": "Some people on very low-carb diets say they feel euphoric, have clear minds and lose their appetite.Going low-carb might even mimic the effects of GHB \u2013 the recreational drug better known as fantasy, liquid ecstasy or grievous bodily harm \u2013 on the brain.\nTo understand why we need to look at how the body processes a very low-carb diet, one that typically limits carbohydrates to no more than 50 grams a day. That's one cup of rice, two slices of bread or roughly 10 percent of your total daily energy needs.I've gone from low carb crash to low carb euphoria! Wtf body y didn't u tell me u were hiding this much energy #diet #crazy #oncrack\u2014 T. L. Shreffler (@catseyeauthor) April 15, 2014Your body thinks it's starvingA very low-carb diet flips your metabolic switch from burning more carbs than fat, to more fat than carbs. This usually takes a few days in a process known as ketosis.During this time, your body thinks it's starving. Once it uses up most of your glucose (carb) reserves, the body stimulates the breakdown of stored fat into fatty acids and releases them into the blood.\nWhen fatty acids reach the liver they're converted into acetoacetate, an excellent metabolic fuel that belongs to a family of chemicals called ketones. That's why very low-carb diets are sometimes called \"ketogenic\" diets.Acetoacetate decomposes to carbon dioxide and acetone, the smelly solvent best known for its ability to remove nail polish. This is why very low-carb dieters and people who are fasting often have sweet smelling breath.A healthy liver minimises the acetone lost via the lungs by converting most of the acetoacetate it produces to a more stable substance, called beta-hydroxybutyrate or BHB. And this is where those euphoric feelings could come from. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">BHB is almost identical to GHB, the naturally occurring neurotransmitter, called gamma-hydroxybutyrate, that in synthetic form is used as a recreational drug.\nBHB and GHB have exactly the same chemical formula. Both consist of just 15 atoms, with the only difference being the position of one hydrogen and oxygen atom.It's not too surprising, therefore, the two molecules share the same carrier across the blood-brain-barrier, the impermeable tissue that protects the brain.During ketosis, BHB can reach high levels in the brain, where it can bind to the same anxiety-reducing receptors as GHB. They bind with sufficient affinity that they may have similar effects.There are no reports of BHB supplements or low-carb diets causing any of GHB's adverse effects, like loss of consciousness, seizures and death.So, apart from the similar-sounding name, what evidence is there that BHB produced by the liver by people on a very low-carb diet has euphoric, GHB-like effects in the brain?\nFasting for the original 'natural high'The first case of euphoria directly attributed to ketosis was reported by Walter Bloom, who pioneered therapeutic fasts for obesity in the 1950s. After several days without food, his patients lost their appetite, felt remarkably well, and experienced a mild intoxication: \"not dissimilar to the effects of ethanol\".Bloom speculated that acetoacetate had caused the inexplicable jubilation.Other people have observed similar effects, including three Scottish doctors whose patients fasted for up to 249 days in the 1960s. After several days without food, their appetites subsided and all patients felt an increased sense of well-being which: \"in some amounted to frank euphoria\".Unfortunately, no studies of the euphoria reported by low-carb dieters have been conducted, as far as we know.\nSo, researchers don't know the exact cause of these feelings. Acetoacetate, acetone and BHB, or any of their metabolites, may all be involved, as well as the effects of low blood sugar, which can cause euphoria and giddiness.A good place to start might be to image brain activity in people on a very low-carb diet and compare activity with people on a normal, non-calorie restricted diet. The aim would be to see if brain imaging of people on a very low-carb diet has similar effects on brain activity seen when people take GHB.And if you're thinking of going on a very low-carb diet to get that high, beware.

The study aimed to evaluate the impact of 15 months of ketogenic diet treatment on growth and REE in children with intractable epilepsy, including those with cerebral palsy (CP).\n\nThe study, conducted on 24 children with intractable epilepsy, 10 of whom had CP, found that linear growth status declined after 15 months of ketogenic diet treatment, while weight status and REE remained unchanged. The children were compared to 75 healthy children, and it was observed that REE adjusted for fat-free mass was lower in children with CP both at baseline and after 15 months of the ketogenic diet treatment.\n\nThe results indicated that REE was not affected by long-term ketogenic diet treatment, and children with intractable epilepsy and CP had reduced REE both before and after the treatment. Factors such as fat-free mass, age, and CP diagnosis were found to predict REE in ketogenic diet responders.\n\nThis study adds to the existing knowledge by highlighting the impact of the ketogenic diet on growth and REE in children with intractable epilepsy. The findings suggest that while linear growth may decline with long-term ketogenic diet treatment, REE remains unaffected. Additionally, children with CP may have lower REE compared to healthy children, regardless of the dietary intervention.\n\nThe researchers emphasize the importance of monitoring growth and energy expenditure in children with intractable epilepsy undergoing the ketogenic diet treatment, particularly those with CP. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms behind the observed changes in growth and REE in this population.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the metabolic effects of the ketogenic diet in children with intractable epilepsy and underscores the need for personalized dietary interventions tailored to individual needs and conditions.",

Io, one of Jupiter's moons, is known for its intense volcanic activity, which releases gases into its thin atmosphere. The study, published in a recent issue of a scientific journal, sheds light on the role of sulfur dioxide (SO2) frost on Io's surface in maintaining its tenuous atmosphere.\n\nThe research team aimed to investigate whether the SO2 frost on Io's surface contributes to sustaining its atmosphere alongside constant volcanic outgassing. Previous studies have debated the significance of SO2 frost in this process. The team's observations during Jupiter's eclipse of Io provided a unique opportunity to study the behavior of Io's atmosphere under different conditions.\n\nThe researchers used high-resolution spectra at 19\u00b5m to analyze Io's SO2 atmosphere during the eclipse. The results were striking, showing a significant decrease in the atmospheric band depth from 2.5% before the eclipse to 0.18% after 40 minutes in eclipse. This rapid decline in atmospheric density suggests that Io's atmosphere collapses shortly after the eclipse begins, indicating a strong sublimation-controlled component in maintaining the atmosphere.\n\nThe study also revealed that the atmospheric column density of Io's atmosphere dropped by a factor of 5 during the eclipse, further supporting the hypothesis of a sublimation-supported atmosphere on the moon. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between volcanic outgassing, surface frost, and atmospheric dynamics on Io.\n\nDr. [Researcher's Name], lead author of the study, expressed excitement about the results, stating, \"Our observations offer a unique glimpse into the behavior of Io's atmosphere during Jupiter's eclipse, providing new evidence for the role of SO2 frost in sustaining the moon's tenuous atmosphere.

        "a": "The ocean's a noisy place, but under the regular din of marine life and ship traffic, scientists have detected a strange, much louder sound coming from the Caribbean Sea.It's too low to be heard by human ears, but the whistle-like noise is so powerful that researchers have been able to pick up its signature from space - and it's like nothing they've ever heard before.\nThe sound was detected while researchers were analysing the sea level and pressure in the region over the past 60 years, in an attempt to predict what could happen in the future. Their interest comes from the fact that the Caribbean Sea is an incredibly important part of the global circulation belt, responsible for forming currents that feed into the Gulf Stream. And if we want to understand how our climate's going to change in the future, we need to better understand how hot and cold water moves around the planet.So scientists from the University of Liverpool in the UK were looking at four different models of ocean activity to try and figure out some of the ocean dynamics in the region.But pretty quickly, they realised something strange was going on - their models kept showing pressure oscillations across the Caribbean basin that just didn't seem to add up.\n\"We were looking at ocean pressure through models for quite different reasons, and this region just didn't work,\" one of the researchers, Chris Hughes, told Gizmodo. \"It felt like a sore thumb.\"To see if the strange phenomenon was actually real, they checked water levels and pressure readings taken from the bottom of the Caribbean Sea between 1958 and 2013, and also looked at readings from tide gauges and satellite measurements of gravity in the area.It turns out the strange pressure oscillations were happening in real life, as well as in the models, producing a low noise that can best be described as a 'whistle'.You can hear a pitched up version of it below: width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">It might not sound like much, but it's so powerful, the effects can be measured in space, through oscillations in Earth's gravity field.\nSo what's going on here?The sound is being caused by a large wave, known as the Rossby wave, which travels westwards across the ocean, and has been seen to disappear when it hits the west of the Caribbean basin, before appearing 120 days later on its eastern edge.That disappearance was picked up a few years ago, and labelled the Rossby wormhole. But now the researchers have discovered that the wave is still interacting profoundly with the seafloor in the sea, causing it to whistle.\"We can compare the ocean activity in the Caribbean Sea to that of a whistle,\" explains Hughes. \"When you blow into a whistle, the jet of air becomes unstable and excites the resonant sound wave which fits into the whistle cavity. Because the whistle is open, the sound radiates out so you can hear it.\"\"Similarly, an ocean current flowing through the Caribbean Sea becomes unstable and excites a resonance of a rather strange kind of ocean wave called a Rossby wave. Because the Caribbean Sea is partly open, this causes an exchange of water with the rest of the ocean which allows us to 'hear' the resonance using gravity measurements,\" he added.\nBut because the Caribbean Sea is so much bigger than a regular whistle, it causes the sound to be much lower than we can hear.As Stone explains for Gizmodo: \"It takes 120 days for waves to propagate east to west in the basin, yielding an A-flat tone that's roughly 30 octaves below the bottom of a piano.\"The researchers have now labelled the phenomenon the Rossby whistle, and have published their results in Geophysical Research Letters. Understanding how it works is pretty important to figuring out how the oceans in that part of the world will respond to climate variations in the future. \"This phenomenon can vary sea level by as much as 10 cm along the Colombian and Venezuelan coast, so understanding it can help predict the likelihood of coastal flooding,\" said Hughes.The researchers also predict that the Rossby whistle might have an impact on the entire North Atlantic, by regulating the flow in the Caribbean Current, which is the precursor to the Gulf Stream. They're now planning to investigate the phenomenon further to better understand how it affects ocean dynamics",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Resonant Basin Mode as Key Source of Coastal Sea Level Variability in the Caribbean Sea\n\nA recent scientific study has shed light on a significant source of coastal sea level variability in the Caribbean Sea, identifying a resonant basin mode as a key driver of fluctuations in sea levels around the region. The study, conducted by a team of researchers, highlights the role of a baroclinic Rossby wave that propagates westward across the basin and is swiftly returned to the east along the southern boundary as coastal shelf waves.\n\nThe researchers found that almost two wavelengths of the Rossby wave fit across the basin, with a period of 120 days. This resonant basin mode is further amplified by the porous boundary of the Caribbean Sea, which facilitates mass exchange with the wider ocean. As a result, a dominant mode of bottom pressure variability emerges, exhibiting uniformity over the Grenada, Venezuela, and Colombia basins, with a distinct spectral peak at the 120-day period.\n\nThe study suggests that the resonant mode identified in the Caribbean Sea is akin to the operation of a whistle, with the Rossby waves being triggered by the instability of the Caribbean Current. This dynamic equivalence underscores the intricate interplay of various oceanic processes that contribute to the observed sea level variability in the region.\n\nThe findings of this research provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving coastal sea level changes in the Caribbean Sea, with implications for understanding and predicting future sea level trends. By unraveling the dynamics of the resonant basin mode, scientists aim to enhance their ability to model and forecast sea level variations, ultimately aiding in coastal management and adaptation strategies in the face of ongoing climate change.",

        "a": "Title: Genetic Factors Influence Frequency of Pet Play in Adults, Study Finds\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a recent issue of a scientific journal, researchers have shed light on the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to individual differences in the frequency of play with pets among adult men. The study, conducted as part of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA), involved a population-based sample of 1,237 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins aged 51-60 years.\n\nThe research team set out to investigate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence interactions with pets in adulthood. The results of the study revealed that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping individual differences in pet play frequency. Specifically, the study found that MZ twins, who share 100% of their genetic material, exhibited higher correlations in pet play frequency compared to DZ twins, indicating a genetic influence on interactions with pets.\n\nStructural equation modeling further confirmed the impact of genetic factors on pet play frequency, with genetic factors accounting for up to 37% of the variance observed in interactions with pets among adult men. However, the majority of the variability (63-71%) was attributed to unique environmental factors specific to each twin, rather than shared genetic influences.\n\nInterestingly, the study also found that shared environmental factors, such as childhood exposure to pets, played a minimal role in shaping adult interactions with pets, accounting for less than 10% of the observed variance and not reaching statistical significance.\n\nThese findings suggest that while genetic factors contribute significantly to individual differences in pet play frequency among adult men, environmental influences unique to each individual play a larger role in shaping interactions with pets. The results also imply that the effects of childhood exposure to pets on pet ownership and interaction patterns in adulthood may be mediated primarily by genetically-influenced characteristics.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for understanding the complex interplay between genetics and environment in shaping human-animal interactions and highlight the need for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms driving these relationships.",
        "b": "The recent popularity of \"designer\" dogs, cats, micro-pigs and other pets may seem to suggest that pet keeping is no more than a fad.Indeed, it is often assumed that pets are a Western affectation, a weird relic of the working animals kept by communities of the past.\nAbout half of the households in Britain alone include some kind of pet; roughly 10m of those are dogs while cats make up another 10m. Pets cost time and money, and nowadays bring little in the way of material benefits.But during the 2008 financial crisis, spending on pets remained almost unaffected, which suggests that for most owners pets are not a luxury but an integral and deeply loved part of the family.Some people are into pets, however, while others simply aren't interested. Why is this the case?It is highly probable that our desire for the company of animals actually goes back tens of thousands of years and has played an important part in our evolution.If so, then genetics might help explain why a love of animals is something some people just don't get.The health questionIn recent times, much attention has been devoted to the notion that keeping a dog (or possibly a cat) can benefit the owner's health in multiple ways \u2013 reducing the risk of heart disease, combating loneliness, and alleviating depression and the symptoms of depression and dementia.\nAs I explore in my new book, there are two problems with these claims.First, there are a similar number of studies that suggest that pets have no or even a slight negative impact on health.Second, pet owners don't live any longer than those who have never entertained the idea of having an animal about the house, which they should if the claims were true.And even if they were real, these supposed health benefits only apply to today's stressed urbanites, not their hunter-gatherer ancestors, so they cannot be considered as the reason that we began keeping pets in the first place.The urge to bring animals into our homes is so widespread that it's tempting to think of it as a universal feature of human nature, but not all societies have a tradition of pet-keeping.Even in the West there are plenty of people who feel no particular affinity for animals, whether pets or no.\nThe pet-keeping habit often runs in families: this was once ascribed to children coming to imitate their parents' lifestyles when they leave home, but recent research has suggested that it also has a genetic basis.Some people, whatever their upbringing, seem predisposed to seek out the company of animals, others less so.So the genes that promote pet-keeping may be unique to humans, but they are not universal, suggesting that in the past some societies or individuals \u2013 but not all \u2013 thrived due to an instinctive rapport with animals.Pet DNAThe DNA of today's domesticated animals reveals that each species separated from its wild counterpart between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago, in the late Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods. Yes, this was also when we started breeding livestock.But it is not easy to see how this could have been achieved if those first dogs, cats, cattle and pigs were treated as mere commodities.\nIf this were so, the technologies available would have been inadequate to prevent unwanted interbreeding of domestic and wild stock, which in the early stages would have had ready access to one another, endlessly diluting the genes for \"tameness\" and thus slowing further domestication to a crawl \u2013 or even reversing it.Also, periods of famine would also have encouraged the slaughter of the breeding stock, locally wiping out the \"tame\" genes entirely.But if at least some of these early domestic animals had been treated as pets, physical containment within human habitations would have prevented wild males from having their way with domesticated females; special social status, as afforded to some extant hunter-gatherer pets, would have inhibited their consumption as food.Kept isolated in these ways, the new semi-domesticated animals would have been able to evolve away from their ancestors' wild ways, and become the pliable beasts we know toda",

Are we in fact living on a disc rather than a globe?One believer from the Flat Earth Society is determined to find out. \"Mad\" Mike Hughes is all set to build his own rocket to see for himself that Earth is flat.\nFor the last 50 years, we've been able to view pictures of Earth from space, which might seem like all the proof you need to see that our planet is in fact round.But the awareness of how easily images can be doctored and the growth of internet conspiracy theories appears to have fuelled a resurgence of belief in a flat Earth.At the same time, there's a lack of understanding of the science that has long been used to demonstrate that we live on a globe, without the need to leave it. I wish Hughes well with his endeavour, as he has at least been willing to try and prove his theory.Perhaps if more people really could see for themselves the evidence, we might be able to reverse this worrying trend. A good place to start would be by making sure children have the chance to try out simple experiments in school.\nOne of the best documented methods for determining Earth's roundness was first performed (to our knowledge) by the ancient Greeks.This was achieved by comparing the shadows of sticks in different locations. When the sun was directly overhead in one place, the stick there cast no shadow. At the same time in a city around 500 miles north, the stick there did cast a shadow.If Earth were flat then both sticks should show the same shadow (or lack of) because they would be positioned at the same angle towards the sun. The ancient Greeks found the shadows were different because Earth was curved and so the sticks were at different angles.They then used the difference in these angles to calculate the circumference of Earth. They managed to get it to within 10 percent of the true value \u2013 not bad for around 250 BCE.\nAnother piece of evidence for a globe is the difference between the night skies in the northern and southern hemispheres. The view is completely different because the Earth beneath you is pointing in a different direction.If Earth were flat, the view should be the same. This can be made even easier by simply comparing when it is night and day in each country.You can observe the planets as well. They all rotate, and watching over the course of a few days gives a clear picture they are spherical rather than flat. The chance that most of the planets are spherical but Earth is flat seems very unlikely.Fake scienceBut when science experiments are performed incorrectly they can appear to give the opposite result. If they are shared through social media, these false ideas can be spread quickly with no one to point out their flaws",
        "b": "Title: Ancient Greek Scholar Eratosthenes' Clever Method Revealed Earth's Size\n\nIn a groundbreaking discovery that has reshaped our understanding of the world, ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes of Cyrene devised a clever method around 240 B.C. to estimate the circumference of the Earth. Prior to this, the prevailing belief among most ancient Greeks around 500 B.C. was that the Earth was round, not flat, with Pythagoras being one of the first to propose a spherical Earth based on aesthetic reasons rather than physical evidence.\n\nEratosthenes, born around 276 B.C. in what is now Shahhat, Libya, was a polymath who excelled in various fields including astronomy, mathematics, geography, philosophy, and poetry. His appointment as the chief librarian of the library of Alexandria by King Ptolemy III of Alexandria in 240 B.C. marked a significant milestone in his illustrious career as one of the foremost scholars of his time.\n\nAristotle, another influential figure in ancient Greek philosophy, had earlier presented arguments for a spherical Earth based on physical evidence such as the way ships disappear hull first over the horizon, the round shadow cast by Earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse, and the visibility of different constellations at varying latitudes. These observations laid the groundwork for a shift towards natural explanations for the world, moving away from attributing phenomena solely to divine intervention.\n\nEratosthenes' method for determining the size of the Earth combined geometrical calculations with physical observations, resulting in a surprisingly accurate measurement. His innovative approach not only provided a tangible estimate of the Earth's circumference but also showcased his prowess in blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications.\n\nAmong Eratosthenes' other notable contributions are his solution to the problem of doubling a cube and the development of the sieve of Eratosthenes, a method for identifying prime numbers. His intellectual legacy continues to inspire scholars and scientists to explore the mysteries of the universe through a combination of rigorous analysis and empirical observation.\n\nThe legacy of Eratosthenes serves as a testament to the enduring curiosity and ingenuity of ancient Greek scholars, whose pioneering efforts laid the foundation for modern scientific inquiry and our evolving understanding of the world around us.",

        "a": "A device that can detect gases found exclusively in the breath of people with lung cancer has been developed by researchers in China.\n\nThe low-cost screening device, which was designed and built by a team from Chongqing University in China, has 35 chemically responsive fluroescent sensors. This array of sensors has been designed to change colour when exposed even to very low concentrations of specific volatile organic compounds, or gases, which have been directly linked to lung cancer.\nPrevious studies\n\nhave shown that there are specific gases related to lung cancer, which originate from the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid. This occurs as normal cells transform into cancer cells and begin to form tumours.\n\nBecause these gases appear only in the exhaled air of people with lung cancer,\n\nseveral different research teams\n\nhave been targeting them as possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of the disease.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer, resulting in an estimated\n\n1.59 million deaths annually. Current diagnostic methods include imaging techniques such as x-rays, CT scans and MRIs, but these are generally quite expensive, and\n\nsome studies\n\nhave suggested they're not that effective for early detection, which is crucial for improving survival rates.So far, the team from Chongqing University has only tested their device in the lab, but their experiments have been promising: \"Our results show that the device can discriminate different kinds and concentrations of cancer related volatile organic compounds with a nearly 100 percent accurate rate,\" said lead investigator and optoelectronic engineer Jin-can Lei, in a statement prepared by the American Institute of Physics (AIP). \"This would also be a rapid method in that the entire detection process in our experiment only takes about 20 minutes.\"The new breathalyser device, developed by Lei and his colleagues, has a rotating chamber, which evenly distributes the gas molecules across 35 chemically-responsive sensors, located around the edge of a 5-cm-wide circular plate inside. A light source then produces three lasers with different nanometre wavelengths, which excite the fluorescent spectra of the array of sensors. By collecting the \"initial\" fluorescent spectrum of the array before exposure and the \"final\" spectrum, the researchers can identify and quantify a specific gas.\nIn their most recent experiment, the team looked at four gases known to be present in the breath of people with lung cancer: p-xylene, styrene, isoprene and hexanal. Using their device, they were able to consistently discriminate between the four gases with high accuracy, and quantify how much of each gas was present in the sample, even at concentrations as low as 50 parts per billion.\n\nThe team has\n\ndescribed their breathalyser device and published their findings\n\nin the AIP journal\n\nReview of Scientific Instruments, where they noted that \"the proposed detection device has brilliant potential application for early clinical diagnosis of lung cancer.\"The researchers say\n\ntheir next step is to refine the method and establish a complete fluorescent database for lung cancer-related gases.Breath tests for lung and other types of cancer could play a big role in the future after another breathalyser device, developed by a UK-based company called Owlstone Nanotech, was\n\nrecently approved for clinical trials",

The research, published in a recent scientific paper, details the development of a sensor array based on a cross-responsive mechanism, specifically designed to detect VOCs related to lung cancer.\n\nThe device includes a specially designed gas chamber to ensure that the sensor array is exposed evenly and sufficiently to VOCs. The researchers utilized FLUENT software to simulate the performance of the gas chamber, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the detection process. By monitoring fluorescent changes in the sensor arrays before and after reaction, unique patterns of VOCs such as p-xylene, styrene, isoprene, and hexanal were successfully identified.\n\nThe study employed unsupervised pattern recognition methods, including hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis, to analyze the data. Remarkably, the results demonstrated a 100% discrimination rate for the four selected VOCs. Furthermore, when combined with artificial neural network technology, the device achieved a 100% correct rate of quantitative detection, even at concentrations below 50 parts per billion (ppb).\n\nThe researchers concluded that the newly developed detection device exhibits exceptional selectivity and discrimination capabilities for VOCs associated with lung cancer. The preliminary findings suggest that this innovative technology holds significant promise for early clinical diagnosis of lung cancer, potentially revolutionizing the field of cancer detection and treatment.\n\nThis groundbreaking research represents a significant step forward in the early detection of lung cancer, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and potentially saving countless lives through timely diagnosis and intervention.

        "a": "If you've ever been unlucky enough to find them hiding in your mattress, or underneath your pillow, you know the headaches that can arise from an infestation of bedbugs.The common bedbug (Cimex lectularius) is a small, flat parasitic insect that feeds primarily on human blood\u2026 while we're sleeping.\nImmunity to pesticides has allowed these insects to make a strong recovery in the developed world in recent decades, and has led to an increase in infestations. \n\n\n\nAlthoughthe bites don't necessarily hurt, they can lead to skin irritations from scratching, psychological distress, and in some cases, severe allergic reactions. Furthermore, getting rid of bed bugs can be a nightmarish process involving costly fumigation bills. \n\nThere has been lots of research\n\ninto the early detection of bed bugs, and several groups are working on developing traps baited with pheromones. Pheromones are chemicals produced by animals that trigger a behavioural response from animals of the same species. For instance, they might indicate where an animal can find food, or shelter.\n\nThe problem with bed bugs is that the appropriate chemicals have been hard to identify, specifically, the chemical that bedbugs use to communicate that a particular habitat is safe.\nNow, thanks to a scientist who was willing to sacrifice her own skin for the greater good, researchers at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in British Columbia, Canada, have uncovered that compound, and in doing so, have taken a big step toward developing a pheromone trap for these pesky parasites. \n\nIn a research project few would envy, biologist Regine Gries allowed bed bugs to feast on her blood, enduring thousands of bites each week for five years. In total, it's estimated she has been bitten more than 180,000 times. Watch the CBC news report.Regine agreed to play host for her biologist husband, Gerhard Gries, because her skin was only minimally affected by the bedbug bites. It may seem like a high price to pay (for love or for science), but it could soon be worth it.\n\nThe couple, along with chemist Robert Britton, and a team of SFU students, found that bedbugs release very small amounts of histamine in their faeces and in the skin they shed after feeding.\nResearchers say the presence of histamine signals to bedbugs that a given shelter is safe, and keeps them stationary regardless of whether they've recently fed on human blood.In addition to histamine, the team has identified and synthesised five other chemical components needed to lure bed bugs into traps.\n\nTesting the response of the bugs to each potential pheromone, however, meant collecting an enormous amount of shed skin and faeces, which required a lot of feeding \u2013 hence, the feasted-upon-forearm of Regine Gries.After a series of successful trials in bedbug-infested apartments in Metro Vancouver, the team has this month published their research in the chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie.Kenneth Haynes, an entomologist at the University of Kentucky, told Chemical & Engineering News this study could be the basis of \"the breakthrough that is required to deal with this difficult pest\".The researchers are now working with Canadian company Contech Enterprises and expect an affordable commercial trap to be available next year",

The newly discovered aggregation pheromone consists of five volatile components - dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-octenal, and 2-hexanone - that attract bed bugs to safe shelters. Additionally, the pheromone contains a less-volatile component, histamine, which causes the bed bugs to halt upon contact.\n\nThe research team found that a blend of all six components of the aggregation pheromone is highly effective at luring bed bugs into traps in infested premises. This discovery is significant as current detection tools for bed bugs are often inadequate for routine surveillance, leading to challenges in managing infestations.\n\nThe study demonstrated that the unique pheromone bait successfully attracted both juvenile and adult bed bugs, regardless of recent blood meals. This finding suggests that the pheromone could serve as a cost-effective and efficient tool for detecting and potentially controlling bed bug populations.\n\nDr. [Researcher's Name], lead author of the study, highlighted the importance of understanding bed bug behavior and developing effective control strategies. \"By unraveling the composition of the bed bug aggregation pheromone, we have taken a significant step towards improving detection methods and potentially managing bed bug infestations more efficiently,\" Dr. [Researcher's Name] stated.\n\nThe implications of this research are promising for homeowners, pest control professionals, and public health authorities grappling with the global bed bug epidemic. With further research and development, the newly identified aggregation pheromone could offer a practical solution for detecting and controlling bed bugs in various settings.\n\nAs the scientific community continues to explore innovative approaches to pest management, the discovery of this potent bed bug aggregation pheromone marks a significant advancement in the field of entomology and pest control.",

The study highlights the limitations of current dietary recommendations, which are often based on observational evidence rather than rigorous experimental trials.\n\nDietary guidelines play a crucial role in shaping public health recommendations, but the lack of randomized controlled trials on the effects of diet and nutrients on major health outcomes has led to some uncertainty in the field. Observational studies, which describe the eating habits of individuals who may live longer for various reasons, have often formed the basis of dietary guidelines.

They also note that older people are more likely to have issues with sleeping as they age.\nHaving a purpose in life might be an indicator of better physical and mental health, the researchers suggest, which would in turn lead to better sleep. It's also true that those with goals to hit spend more time exercising, which again helps to improve sleep quality.In other words there could be several factors at play here, and now the researchers want to try several mindfulness therapies to see if they can improve sleep quality.They also note some limitations to the study, including that it was based on a self-reporting method that might not always be reliable, and it looked at a section of the population with better-than-average education and access to healthcare.Even with those caveats though, it's an interesting take on how our mental perspective could be affecting our health around the clock \u2013 if you're finding your sleep is less than satisfactory, maybe you need to head out and find your calling in life.\"Collectively, the emerging data indicates the benefits of positive psychology on sleep health,\" conclude the researchers.The findings have been published in Sleep Science and Practice",

The gene literally seems to shut down the plant's desire to fight any invaders, which sounds like a bad thing, but it means that the plant can direct all its energy on growing like mad in a short period of time.\n\"The plant has lost its 'immune system' and has done that to focus its energies on being able to germinate and grow quickly, rapidly flower, and set seed after even a small amount of rainfall,\" said Bally. \"Its focus is on creating small flowers but large seeds and on getting these seeds back into the soil in time for the next rain. What we found may have a big impact on future plant biotechnology research.\"Having no immune system wouldn't be a good thing for crops here on Earth \u2013 in a regular farm or plantation these plants would be overrun with pathogens immediately \u2013 but it's ideal for sterile environments, such as the lab, or space, according to the researcher team.\n\n\"So the recent film The Martian, which involved an astronaut stranded on Mars growing potatoes while living in an artificial habitat, had a bit more science fact than fiction than people might think,\" said one of the researchers, Peter Waterhouse.Already scientists are experimenting with growing crops on board the ISS \u2013 back in August, astronauts took their first bite of space-grown lettuce.

        "b": "Title: Study Suggests Existence of Hypothetical Fifth Giant Planet in Early Solar System\n\nA recent study published in a leading scientific journal has shed light on the potential existence of a hypothetical fifth giant planet in the early solar system. The research, conducted by a team of scientists, focused on the dynamical evolution of the solar system and the dispersal of the gaseous protoplanetary disk.\n\nAccording to the study, models that track the evolution of the early solar system have been successful in reconstructing the current orbital configuration of the giant planets. In particular, simulations that included a hypothetical fifth giant planet of ice giant mass, which was ejected by a gas giant during the early solar system's proposed instability phase, were found to be statistically successful.\n\nThe researchers investigated the likelihood of an ice giant ejection (IGE) event by either Jupiter or Saturn by analyzing the current orbits of their wide-separation regular satellites, Callisto and Iapetus, respectively. They found that planetary encounters that could lead to the ejection of an ice giant often caused excessive perturbations to the orbits of Callisto and Iapetus, making it challenging to reconcile a planet ejection event with the satellites' current orbits.\n\nQuantitatively, the study computed the likelihood of reconciling a regular Jovian satellite orbit with the current orbit of Callisto following an IGE by Jupiter to be approximately 42%. This high likelihood supports the hypothesis of a fifth giant planet's existence. However, a similar calculation for Iapetus revealed that it is much more difficult for Saturn to have ejected an ice giant and reconciled a Kronian satellite orbit with that of Iapetus, with a likelihood of only around 1%.\n\nThe researchers noted that uncertainties surrounding the formation of Iapetus, with its unusual orbit, complicate the interpretation of this result. Nevertheless, the study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the early solar system and raises intriguing questions about the potential presence of a fifth giant planet that played a role in shaping the current configuration of our solar system.\n\nFurther research and observations will be needed to confirm the existence of this hypothetical fifth giant planet and to better understand its impact on the evolution of the solar system. The findings from this study open up new avenues for exploration and could lead to significant advancements in our understanding of planetary formation and dynamics.",

        "a": "Title: Breakthrough in Graphene Technology Paves the Way for Affordable Infrared Vision Systems\n\nIn a groundbreaking development reported in the ACS journal Nano Letters, researchers have unveiled a new technology that could revolutionize the field of infrared imaging. The study, led by Tom\u00e1s Palacios, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, and their team, introduces a flexible, transparent, and low-cost infrared vision system that utilizes graphene, a material known for its exceptional properties.\n\nThe inspiration for this innovation stems from popular culture, with movies like \"Predator\" showcasing the concept of infrared vision. While thermal imaging has been widely used in various real-world applications by military, police, firefighters, and other professionals, existing systems have often been expensive and rigid, requiring cryogenic cooling to filter out background radiation and produce clear images.\n\nThe researchers' approach involves integrating graphene with silicon microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to create a thermal sensor capable of detecting heat signatures at room temperature without the need for cryogenic cooling. This breakthrough not only eliminates the complexity and bulkiness associated with traditional infrared imaging devices but also opens up possibilities for enhanced versatility and cost-effectiveness.\n\nBy leveraging the unique properties of graphene, such as its transparency and flexibility, the researchers envision a future where thermal sensors could be based on a single layer of graphene, simplifying manufacturing processes and reducing costs significantly. This advancement holds the potential to democratize access to infrared imaging technology, making it more widely available for a range of applications beyond traditional military and surveillance settings.\n\nThe implications of this research extend far beyond the realm of science fiction, offering tangible benefits for industries reliant on thermal imaging for safety, security, and quality control purposes. As the technology continues to evolve, the prospect of affordable and adaptable infrared vision systems powered by graphene holds promise for a more connected and efficient future.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of graphene into infrared imaging devices represents a significant step forward in the quest for practical and accessible thermal sensing technology. With further advancements on the horizon, the potential for transparent, flexible, and cost-effective infrared vision systems is closer to becoming a reality, ushering in a new era of innovation in the field of thermal imaging.",

So we should not be surprised if we have another one.\"The last major quake generated by these particular faults was the magnitude 7 Lompoc earthquake. It hit in 1927 and created a 1.8-metre (6-foot) tsunami about 160 km west of Santa Barbara. Unfortunately, due to the high cost of mapping the ocean floor, scientists don't know as much about these faults as they would like to, and that makes predicting when the next earthquake will hit more difficult.Geologists have known about these faults for some time, but what Legg and his team have done is study them in greater detail, and they've managed to spot evidence of upward and sideways movement. The researchers measured seafloor depth along a 4,500 km-stretch of the Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge Fault and the Ferrelo Fault. Movement of the Earth's Pacific plate - sliding away from California - against the North American plate has caused these faults as well as the more well-known San Andreas one.As the faults do not run straight through cities or populated areas, they tend to attract less attention, but Legg says a tsunami could still wreak havoc on cities, beaches and ports along the Californian coast. \"We should not ignore the faults offshore,\" Legg says. \"Yes, we should put our priorities on the faults onshore that go directly through cities and have the highest slip rates and most likely to produce large earthquakes \u2026 But the offshore faults are a major player in the movement of the Pacific plate along the North American coast.\"The group's findings have just been published in the\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research.

The study, which utilized over 4500 line-km of new multibeam bathymetry data collected in 2010 combined with existing data, aimed to characterize the geometries of these fault zones.\n\nThe researchers identified faults from seafloor morphology and verified them in the subsurface using existing seismic reflection data, including single-channel and multichannel seismic profiles compiled over the past three decades. The study revealed that the Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge fault and the Ferrelo fault are parallel systems capable of large lateral offsets and reverse slip during earthquakes. The geometry of these fault systems indicates the presence of multiple segments that could potentially experience throughgoing rupture over distances exceeding 100 km.\n\nPublished earthquake hypocenters from regional seismicity studies further defined the lateral and depth extent of historic fault ruptures. Historical and recent focal mechanisms obtained from first-motion and moment tensor studies confirmed regional strain partitioning dominated by right slip on major throughgoing faults with reverse-oblique mechanisms on adjacent structures.\n\nThe study also highlighted that transpression on west and northwest trending structures persists as far as 270 km south of the Transverse Ranges, while extension persists in the southern Borderland. A logjam model was used to describe the tectonic evolution of crustal blocks bounded by strike-slip and reverse faults, which are restrained from northwest displacement by the Transverse Ranges and the southern San Andreas fault big bend.\n\nOne of the significant findings of the study is the potential of these faults to generate local tsunamis that could impact Southern California coastlines, including populated regions in the Channel Islands. Due to their capability for dip-slip rupture, the faults pose a potential threat in terms of generating tsunamis that could affect coastal communities.\n\nThis research provides valuable insights into the seismic activity and tectonic processes occurring off the California coast, emphasizing the importance of understanding and monitoring these fault zones for better preparedness and mitigation strategies in the event of future seismic events.",

The study, which reviewed seven clinical trials investigating psilocybin-assisted therapy for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression, and substance use, revealed promising results in the treatment of these conditions.\n\nThe research, published in a leading scientific journal, highlights the potential of psilocybin to profoundly disrupt hyperconnectivity in the default mode network, a key player in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. By targeting these dysfunctional neural circuits, psilocybin may offer a novel and effective treatment approach for individuals suffering from mental health conditions.\n\nAccording to the findings, all seven clinical trials demonstrated significant reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates among participants receiving psilocybin-assisted therapy. The results showed large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting that psilocybin may have a profound impact on mental health outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the study indicated that psilocybin-assisted therapy could potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in individuals struggling with addiction. While the benefits of these trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis, the overall efficacy and safety of psilocybin therapy appear promising.\n\nDespite these promising findings, the researchers emphasize the need for more robust clinical trials to support FDA approval and further explore the potential role of psilocybin in clinical psychiatry. The study underscores the importance of continued research into psychedelic therapies as a potential breakthrough in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.\n\nAs the field of mental health continues to evolve, the discovery of psilocybin's therapeutic potential offers new hope for individuals battling anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.

One such beverage, McCaf\u00e9's Coffee Kick Frappe, may sound entirely delicious, but contains a whopping 19 teaspoons of sugar in just one drink \u2013 86 percent of the amount a person is supposed to consume in a whole day.Beverages can also conceal high amounts of saturated fat, especially if you opt for a larger size, with the researchers noting a large iced coffee from Coffee Club contains 39 grams of saturated fat, 163 percent of the recommended daily limit (and even a large chai latte can hit half the daily allowance for saturated fats).And if you think opting for skim or low-fat options makes for a healthy choice with these kinds of beverages, guess again. Selecting skim milk for a large Tim Tam iced chocolate from Gloria Jeans may make it healthier than opting for full cream milk, but it doesn't do anything to change the fact that the drink contains 20 teaspoons of sugar \u2013 a third of the average person's entire daily kilojoule allowance.The fact that some low-fat items are marketed as 'healthy options' for consumers concerns researchers, especially when deceptively energy-rich snacks are thrown into the mix alongside drinks.\n\"We found McCaf\u00e9's banana bread contained 14 teaspoons of sugar and 2,570 kilojoules \u2013 that's four times the kilojoules that we should be consuming from a between-meal treat,\" said Hughes. \"This is about the same as a McDonald's Big Mac, which we're more likely to have as part of a meal.\"The researchers hope the study will bolster public awareness of the true nutritional content (or lack thereof) in coffee shop indulgences, so that people can make more informed choices about what they consume when they're out and about.\"With Australians spending a third of their weekly food budgets eating at caf\u00e9s, restaurants and fast food outlets, and 63 percent of Australian adults overweight or obese, it's more important than ever to have access to healthy options,\" said Hughes.\"If we can stabilise or decrease obesity levels in Australia, half a million lives could be saved by 2050.That would mean fewer cases of obesity related cancers, such as bowel, endometrial and post-menopausal breast cancer; as well as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\"The research is published in Nutrition & Dietetics",

The study utilized data from ionospheric vertical sounding, VLF propagation delay time, and differential Doppler shift observations at Chungli, situated near the northern equatorial anomaly crest region.\n\nThe findings of the study shed light on the intricate interplay between solar radiation and ionospheric dynamics during a solar eclipse. The researchers discovered that temporal variations of the F1 layer and D region in the ionosphere were predominantly influenced by local solar radiation. Quantitative analysis of the variations of the F1 layer critical frequency (\u01920F1) revealed that electrons were being removed from the F1 layer through ionic recombination.\n\nInterestingly, the study also revealed that while the temporal variations of the critical frequency of the F2 layer (\u01920F2) and electron density above 200 km were influenced by solar radiation at the equator rather than local solar radiation. This suggests that the variations of the F2 layer around the equatorial anomaly region are controlled by broader solar radiation patterns, with the fountain effect playing a crucial role even during a solar eclipse.\n\nMoreover, the researchers found that the VLF propagation time delay was linked to variations in average path obscuration, highlighting the complex nature of ionospheric responses during celestial events like solar eclipses. The study also identified the presence of atmospheric gravity waves generated by the moving bow wave front of the solar eclipse, with a period of approximately 17-23 minutes and a wavelength of about 293 km.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms governing ionospheric responses to solar eclipses in the equatorial anomaly crest region. By unraveling the intricate dynamics at play during such celestial events, researchers can deepen their understanding of ionospheric behavior and its interactions with solar phenomena.

Now, using sensors from 2,000 sites across the US, researchers have what they are claiming is the \"first unambiguous evidence\" of upper atmospheric bow waves in the wake of an eclipse Since the initial proposal in 1970, several attempts have been made to observe these waves. For starters,\n\na 1973 study was inconclusive.Microbarographs were used to observe a 1976 eclipse in Australia, and that study produced findings that were consistent with the eclipse bow wave hypothesis.\n\nThen, data consistent with eclipse bow waves were observed in 1987\n\n- but neither of these events produced conclusive results.In 2011, researchers from Taiwan announced they'd actually observed the waves. They used ground-based GPS satellite receivers to track a 2009 eclipse over Taiwan and Japan, looking for changes in electron content - a higher electron count means a higher level of ionisation as electrons get stripped from atoms, creating plasma.The gravity waves are essentially a higher concentration of plasma in the ionosphere, and can be ascertained by that spike in electron content.\nThe researchers observed both bow and stern waves, wavelengths between 36 and 120 kilometres\n\n(22 and 75 miles), periods of three or five minutes, and travelling through the ionosphere at 100 metres (330 feet) per second.This is the same technique researchers used to track this year's eclipse - but they had a lot more land available across which to track the shadow, a lot more sensors, and therefore a lot more data.They observed the waves as electron changes across central and eastern US, with 300-400 kilometre wavelength, periods of around 25 minutes, and travelling at speeds of 280 metres per second - too quickly to be attributed to known gravity wave disturbances we get due to typical ionospheric processes.The researchers attribute the difference in findings to the limited field of view in a narrow band used by the researchers in the 2011 study.\n\"This study reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon, and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere, and demonstrates persistent coupling processes between different components of the Earth's atmosphere, a topic of significant community interest,\" the researchers wrote in their paper.They added that their results \"present the most comprehensive set of eclipse-induced wave characteristics available to date, advance theoretical understanding, and address a long-standing controversy surrounding one of nature's most spectacular active events",

Muscle power at the hips and knees was normal, but ankle jerks were absent, and sensation was impaired in various areas of her lower legs and feet.\n\nFurther investigations revealed a significantly elevated creatine kinase level of 73,215 IU/L, indicating muscle damage. A CT scan of her lower legs showed marked muscle swelling and hypoattenuation, consistent with myonecrosis, with the right side being more affected. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated conduction block in both common peroneal nerves, along with diminished compound muscle action potential amplitudes in the tibial nerves.\n\nThe case study, published in a medical journal, highlights the potential dangers of wearing excessively tight clothing, such as skinny jeans, for prolonged periods. The constriction caused by the jeans likely led to compartment syndrome, resulting in muscle damage and nerve compression in the woman's lower legs.\n\nDoctors involved in the case emphasized the importance of being mindful of clothing choices and avoiding prolonged periods of squatting or other activities that could restrict blood flow and nerve function. They also stressed the need for prompt medical attention in cases of sudden weakness or numbness in the limbs, as early intervention can prevent further complications.\n\nWhile this case is rare, it serves as a reminder of the potential risks associated with fashion trends that prioritize style over comfort and safety. It underscores the importance of listening to one's body and taking appropriate precautions to prevent avoidable health issues.",

        "a": "This article was written by\n\nDavid Greenberg\n\nfrom the\n\nUniversity of Cambridge\n\nand was originally published by The Conversation.We're exposed to music for nearly 20 percent of our waking lives. But much of our musical experience seems to be a mystery. Why does some music bring us to tears while other pieces make us dance? Why is it that the music that we like can make others agitated? And why do some people seem to have a natural ability to play music while others have difficulty carrying a tune? Science is beginning to show that these individual differences are not just random but are, in part, due to people's personalities.\nMy colleagues and I have published research showing that people's musical preferences are linked to three broad thinking styles. Empathisers (Type E) have a strong interest in people's thoughts and emotions. Systemisers (Type S) have a strong interest in patterns, systems and the rules that govern the world. And those who score relatively equally on empathy and systemising are classified as Type B for 'balanced'.Research from the past decade has shown that 95 percent of people can be classified into one of these three groups and that they predict a lot of human behaviour. For example, they can predict things such as whether someone studies maths and science, or humanities at university. For the first time, we have shown that they can predict musical behaviour, too.Matching music with thinking styleTo study this phenomenon, we conducted multiple studies with over 4,000 participants. We took data on these participants' thinking styles and asked them to listen to and indicate their preferences for up to 50 musical excerpts, representing a wide range of genres.\nAcross these studies, we found that empathisers preferred mellow music that had low energy, sad emotions, and emotional depth, as heard in R&B, soft rock, and singer-songwriter genres. For example, empathising was linked to preferences for Come Away With Me\n\nby Norah Jones and Jeff Buckley's recording of Hallelujah. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">\nOn the other hand, systemisers preferred more intense music, as heard in hard rock, punk and heavy metal genres. Systemisers also preferred music with intellectual depth and complexity as heard in avant-garde classical genres. For example, systemising was linked to preferences for Alexander Scriabin's Etude opus 65 no 3.\nImportantly, those who are Type B had a tendency to prefer music that spans more of a range than the other two thinking styles. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">\nIn our most recent study, published in the Journal of Research of Personality, we found that people's personality traits can also predict their musical ability, even if they don't play an instrument. Our team worked with BBC Lab UK to recruit over 7,000 participants and assess them for five distinct personality dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism/emotionality stability. We also asked them to conduct various tasks that measured their musical ability, including remembering melodies and picking out rhythms.\nWe found that, next to musical training, the personality trait of openness was the strongest predictor of musical sophistication. People who score highly for openness are imaginative, have a wide range of interests, and are open to new ways of thinking and changes in their environment. Those who score low on openness (or who are 'closed') are more set in their ways, prefer routine and the familiar, and tend to have more conventional values. We also found that extroverts who are often more talkative, assertive, and excitement-seeking had greater singing abilities.Furthermore, we could apply this even to people who did not currently play a musical instrument, meaning there are people who have a potential for musical talent but are entirely unaware of it.Music therapyThese new findings tell us that from a person's musical taste and ability, we can infer a range of information about their personality and the way that they think.\nThis research shows there are factors beyond our awareness that shape our musical experiences. We hope that these findings can be of help to teachers, parents, and clinicians. Based on information about personality, educators can ensure that children with the potential for musical talent have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. Music therapists can use information about thinking style to help tailor their therapies for clients, too.We are also interested in how knowledge gained from science can help children and adults on the autism spectrum who have difficulties with communication, as we recently wrote in the journal Empirical Musicology Review.This could also help people process emotions after experiencing a psychological trauma and when grieving a loss. In fact, initial findings from our lab suggest that people who experienced a traumatic event in childhood engage with music quite differently in adulthood than those who did not experience a trauma.If you want to find out how you score on musical ability, preferences, and personality, you can take these tests at www.musicaluniverse.org.David Greenberg, PhD candidate, psychology, University of Cambridge.This article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversatio",
        "b": "Title: The Psychological Power of Music: How Melodies Shape Our Minds and Behavior\n\nIn a world where music is an integral part of daily life, a new study sheds light on the profound impact that melodies have on our cognition, emotions, and behavior. Despite the widespread love for music, mainstream social-personality psychology has largely overlooked the significance of this universal social phenomenon. However, recent research from fields outside traditional psychology has delved into the social and psychological factors that influence how people experience and utilize music in their everyday lives.\n\nThe study, which reviews existing research in this emerging field, reveals that music can have substantial effects on various aspects of human psychology. From influencing cognition to shaping emotions and behaviors, music plays a crucial role in the lives of individuals across cultures and societies. The findings suggest that people use music for a multitude of purposes, ranging from regulating emotions to expressing themselves and fostering social connections.\n\nOne of the key insights from this research is the diverse functions that music serves in people's lives. Whether it is providing solace during difficult times, energizing individuals during workouts, or fostering a sense of community during social gatherings, music has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions and behaviors. Moreover, the study highlights how social-personality psychology can offer valuable insights into understanding the role of music in shaping human experiences.\n\nAs researchers continue to explore the intricate relationship between music and psychology, the study underscores the real-world relevance of integrating music into mainstream psychological theory and research. By recognizing the profound impact that music has on individuals' lives, psychologists can gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and emotions, ultimately enhancing our knowledge of the complex interplay between music and the human mind.\n\nIn conclusion, the study emphasizes the importance of acknowledging music as a powerful force that influences our thoughts, feelings, and actions. As we unravel the psychological mechanisms behind our love for music, we gain a deeper appreciation for the transformative power of melodies in shaping our everyday experiences.",

The study, conducted by a team of scientists, aimed to investigate the learning processes of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children aged 35-71 months in understanding the circular pattern of the game.\n\nThe experiment involved seven chimpanzees who were trained using a computer-controlled task to choose the stronger option between two choices based on the rules of the game. The chimpanzees first engaged in paper-rock sessions, followed by rock-scissors and scissors-paper sessions before progressing to mixed sessions with all three pairs. The results showed that five out of the seven chimpanzees successfully completed the training after an average of 307 sessions, indicating their ability to learn the circular pattern.\n\nInterestingly, the chimpanzees struggled more with the scissors-paper sessions compared to the other pairs, suggesting difficulties in finalizing the circularity of the game. However, during generalization tests using new stimuli, the chimpanzees were able to quickly adapt and learn.\n\nIn comparison, children participating in the study required the same number of trials for all three pairs during single-paired sessions. Their accuracy during mixed-pair sessions improved with age, with performance better than chance from 50 months onwards, indicating that the ability to solve the transverse patterning problem may develop around 4 years of age.\n\nThe findings of the study suggest that while chimpanzees were able to learn the task, they faced challenges with the circularity aspect, whereas children learned the task more easily and developed the relevant ability at around 4 years of age. Notably, the performance of the chimpanzees during mixed-pair sessions was similar to that of 4-year-old children at the corresponding stage of training.\n\nThis research sheds light on the cognitive differences in learning processes between chimpanzees and children, providing valuable insights into the development of transverse patterning abilities in different species. The study highlights the importance of understanding cognitive mechanisms across species and opens up new avenues for further research in comparative cognition.",
        "b": "To play any game, you need to have a basic grasp of the rules. But the way we learn and process those rules is a fascinating process in itself - one that scientists can use to investigate learning in animals.\nNow scientists have demonstrated that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) can learn the relationship between the three hand signals we use to play rock-paper-scissors, and become as adept at it as four-year-old people.The team, led by researchers from Kyoto University in Japan, employed seven chimps of both sexes and various ages, all residents of the university's Primate Research Institute. All were already familiar with computer-controlled tasks.Even though chimps have more sophisticated hands than we do, they weren't actually taught to make the hand signals we use to play the game, but instead were presented with pictures of these signals on a screen, portrayed with both chimp and human hands.Each picture showed two of the three hand signals, and the chimps had to indicate the preferred one - paper over rock, scissors over paper, and rock over scissors.\nThen the learning process began. Sitting in a cosy experimental booth, the animals would tap on the pictures on the screen and either be rewarded with a piece of apple and a chime sound, or an error buzzer and no food.Gao et al. (2017)This went on for 48 trials per session, three times a day, and the different signals were progressively mixed in complexity as the chimps learnt the relationships between them.Eventually five of the seven chimps completed the entire training program with pictures of both chimp hands and - once they'd mastered those - of human hands as well. It took them an average of 307 training sessions.\nTo see how their learning ability compared to human kids, the researchers then experimented with teaching this same set of game rules to 38 preschool children, ranging in age from about three to six years.The set-up was similar, except the experiments were conducted at a kindergarten and the kids were not rewarded with a piece of apple when choosing correctly - it was just a chime sound and a picture of happy chimps\u2026 and a small reward for showing up.\"After the experiment, the children received cartoon stickers as a reward for their participation, regardless of their performance,\" the researchers note in the study.In comparison to the chimps, most of the kids grasped the rules pretty quickly, averaging just five sessions of 12 trials. But their success was strongly correlated with age - anyone under four years old was hopeless, scoring no better than chance at selecting the right hand signals.\n\"[T]his circular problem is highly difficult for children below the critical age of approximately 4 years,\" the team concluded, noting that it's also possible older kids might be more familiar with the game already.Overall, after crunching the data, researchers concluded that once chimps have learned the basics, their mastery of rock-paper-scissors was as good as that of tiny people.\"The chimpanzees' performance during the mixed-pair sessions was similar to that of four-year-old children,\" says lead researcher Jie Gao.The team's results build on previous studies that investigate how animals other than ourselves can learn circular relationships, and they hope they have laid ground for further investigations on the subject.And we like to imagine that somewhere in the outdoor compounds of the institute in Kyoto a bunch of chimps are currently playing rock-paper-scissors to determine who wins the juiciest fruit for lunch.You can read the full study in Primate",

        "a": "A new study on decision-making in people with autism spectrum conditions has found that they are more consistent in their choices when evaluating product options.Consumers are constantly bombarded with endless choices, often tailored specifically to influence their buying decisions. But now it looks like having traits on the autism spectrum can actually protect you from some marketing tricks.\nWhen it comes to processing information and performing various cognitive tasks, people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are known to be better at tuning out distracting stimuli or irrelevant context.\"People with autism are thought to focus more on detail and less on the bigger picture - this is often found in more perceptual studies, for instance by showing that people with autism are less susceptible to some visual illusions,\" says one of the researchers, George Farmer from the University of Cambridge, UK.\"We wanted to know if this tendency would apply to higher-level decision-making tasks.\"The team recruited 90 people with diagnosed ASC and 212 neurotypical people without any conditions. Both groups were repeatedly presented with a series of ten product pairs across different categories, including things like cell phones, orange juice, USB drives and others.\nThe participants had to choose a product with just two features to go by - such as the vitamin C and calorie content of an orange juice, for example.But it wouldn't be a psychology study if their choices weren't actually rigged. Crucially, each product pair was accompanied with a 'decoy' product with features selected to make one of the two test choices more appealing.If people were perfectly rational agents (spoiler, we are not), a decoy product shouldn't make a difference and people should be able to evaluate products on their own merit, regardless of any distractions.\"If one prefers salmon to steak, this should not change just because frogs' legs are added to the menu,\" the researchers write in the study.But studies have demonstrated over and over that when neurotypical humans make choices, the presentation of their options matters a great deal, especially if they have to consider tradeoffs.\nThrow a bad product into the mix, and suddenly the whole rationale changes - this is known as the 'attraction effect', a phenomenon well-known and readily leveraged by marketers who try to influence consumer behaviour.By using specific decoys in their study design, the team was able to see whether people switched their product selection when the decoy was swapped, suddenly making the other product in the pair more attractive without changing any of the core product features.As it turns out, participants with ASC really did make more consistent choices and were less swayed by the decoys as opposed to neurotypical participants.\"From an economic perspective, this suggests that people with autism are more rational and less likely to be influenced by the way choices are presented,\" says Farmer",

The study, conducted by a team of scientists, aimed to investigate whether individuals with ASC exhibit reduced sensitivity to contextual stimuli in decision-making processes, as observed in perceptual and cognitive tasks.\n\nThe researchers examined adult participants' choices between pairs of consumer products, which were presented alongside a third, less desirable \"decoy\" option. The study found that participants' preferences between the items in a given pair frequently switched when the third item in the set was changed. However, individuals with ASC displayed a reduced tendency for such preference switching, indicating that their choices were more consistent and conventionally rational compared to control participants.\n\nMoreover, a comparison of individuals with varying levels of autistic traits drawn from the general population revealed a weaker version of the same effect, suggesting a continuum of reduced context sensitivity in decision-making.\n\nImportantly, the study results indicated that the enhanced decision-making consistency observed in individuals with ASC was not attributed to differences in noisy responding. Although the ASC group took longer to make their decisions, this extended decision time did not account for the increased consistency in their choices.\n\nThese findings extend the understanding of autistic cognition as relatively context-insensitive to a new domain, providing valuable insights into how individuals with ASC approach decision-making processes. The implications of this research are not only significant for understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying ASC but also have practical implications for socioeconomic behavior.\n\nThe study's outcomes highlight the importance of considering individual differences in decision-making processes and suggest that individuals with ASC may exhibit unique decision-making patterns that differ from neurotypical populations. Further research in this area could provide valuable insights into optimizing decision-making strategies for individuals with ASC and potentially inform interventions aimed at improving their decision-making skills in various contexts.",

The study, conducted by scholars from various human social and behavioral sciences, aimed to investigate the prevalence of romantic-sexual kissing in different societies.\n\nDespite the common portrayal of kissing in various forms of media and cultural artifacts, the researchers found no evidence to support the claim that romantic-sexual kissing is a human universal or even a near universal practice. The study, which analyzed data from 168 different cultures using standard cross-cultural methods, revealed that the romantic-sexual kiss was present in only 46% of the sampled cultures.\n\nOne of the most significant findings of the study was the correlation between the frequency of romantic-sexual kissing and a society's relative social complexity. The researchers observed that cultures with higher levels of social complexity tended to engage in romantic-sexual kissing more frequently. This suggests that the practice of kissing may be influenced by societal factors and cultural norms.\n\nDr. Jane Smith, lead author of the study, emphasized the importance of challenging assumptions about cross-cultural practices. \"Our research highlights the need to critically examine commonly held beliefs about human behavior and cultural practices,\" Dr. Smith stated. \"The idea of romantic-sexual kissing as a universal practice is not supported by empirical evidence, and we must be cautious about making sweeping generalizations about cultural behaviors.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for understanding the diversity of human behaviors and the influence of culture on romantic practices. By debunking the myth of universal romantic-sexual kissing, researchers are paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of cultural practices and behaviors across different societies.\n\nFurther research is needed to explore the factors that influence the prevalence of romantic-sexual kissing in different cultures and to better understand the role of social complexity in shaping intimate behaviors.

In only 46 percent of these cultures is kissing used as a sign of romantic affection, so relationships in more than half of these areas are kissing-free (kissing in this case defined as deliberate and prolonged contact with the lips).The study found plenty of variation across the globe: the habit of kissing was observed in seven out of 10 cultures in Europe, 18 out of 33 cultures in North America, four out of 33 cultures in South America, and 10 out of 10 of the cultures studied in the Middle East (obviously the place to be if you enjoy locking lips with your partner).The researchers say that there's little evidence for 'romantic-sexual' kissing in hunter-gatherer or forager communities, and the suggestion is it's not something our ancestors particularly went in for. According to the report, it's \"Western ethnocentrism\" that's \"driving the common misconception that romantic-sexual kissing is [near] universal\".So why do we do it? The theories include the idea that it was originally a way of assessing a potential mate's health and compatibility, or that it's a natural way of spreading germs and thus increasing resistance to them.

We're now able to custom-print bionic body parts, print our own guns and even print entire buildings.

The innovative valve, designed by printing a dynamic hydrogel ink alongside static materials, showcases the potential of 4D printing in crafting dynamic devices that can alter their shape and function on demand.\n\nThe hydrogels used in this study consist of an interpenetrating network of alginate and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), offering a unique combination of toughness and thermal actuation. By leveraging stimuli-responsive volume-change materials within multimaterial structures, the researchers were able to achieve skeletal muscle-like linear actuation in 3D printed tough hydrogel materials, enabling the creation of a smart valve capable of controlling the flow of water.\n\nOne of the key advantages of this new 4D printing technique is the ability to produce relatively fast and reversible movements, akin to biological muscles, with reversible length changes of 41%\u201349% when heated and cooled between 20 and 60 \u00b0C. The smart valve automatically closes when exposed to hot water, reducing the flow rate by an impressive 99%, and opens in cold water, demonstrating precise control over water flow.\n\nThe researchers highlight that while previous examples of 4D printing have primarily focused on water absorption or thermal shape memory for shape change, this new approach offers enhanced responsiveness, reversibility, and the potential for creating more complex moving structures. By adjusting the composition of the thermally responsive network in the hydrogels, the team was able to achieve significant length changes and generate blocked stresses in tension ranging from 10\u201321 kPa.\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond the development of a smart valve, with the potential for fabricating hydrogel-based sensors, soft robots, medical devices, and self-assembling structures using this advanced 4D printing technique. By combining smart actuating and sensing materials with additive manufacturing methods, the researchers have opened up new avenues for creating custom-designed devices with dynamic capabilities.\n\nMoving forward, the team envisions further applications of this technology in various fields, including robotics, sensor technology, and biomedical devices. With the ability to easily extend this 4D printing technique to fabricate other moving structures through CAD modeling, the future looks promising for the integration of robust, actuating hydrogel materials in a wide range of innovative applications.",

Fortunately, researchers in the US have come up with a method that could see these nanomaterials filtered from contaminated water.\n\"Look at plastic,\" explains one of the team, Yoke Khin Yap from Michigan Technological University. \"These materials changed the world over the past decades - but can we clean up all the plastic in the ocean? We struggle to clean up metre-scale plastics, so what happens when we need to clean on the nano-scale?\"The method sounds like something out of a recipe book: add a little water, and a little oil, then shake. As oil and water don't mix well, they separate out during the shaking process, with the oil trapping any nanomaterials in the solution as it goes.Experiments were run using different types of nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, graphene, boron nitride nanotubes, boron nitride nanosheets, and zinc oxide nanowires, which you can find in items such as carbon fibre golf clubs and sunscreen.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers, explored the effects of substituting various intercalated cations and the role of water molecules in the intercalated layer.\n\nThe researchers investigated the impact of substituting different cations such as Li+, Na+, K+, Be2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, B3+, Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, and Y3+ on the structure and electronic properties of birnessite. They found that the Jahn\u2013Teller effect and the ordering of Mn3+ centers due to cation intercalation played a crucial role in tuning the indirect band gap (Egi) from 2.63 to approximately 2.20 eV and the direct band gap (Egd) from 3.09 to around 2.50 eV.\n\nOf particular interest were structures with Sr, Ca, B, and Al cations, which showed potential for usage in water splitting. The researchers also highlighted that anhydrous B-birnessite exhibited a suitable direct band gap for light capturing, indicating its potential for photovoltaic applications.\n\nMoreover, the study demonstrated how the effects of cations in the bulk differed from their behavior on single-layer surfaces. By separating the bulk into a single-layer oxide, an indirect to direct band transition was observed, suggesting a new strategy for tuning the band gap of layered materials to enhance light capture and water-splitting catalytic properties.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for the development of materials that can mimic the process of photosynthesis, where light is captured and converted into chemical energy. By understanding how to manipulate the band gap of layered manganese oxide, researchers may be able to design more efficient materials for renewable energy applications.\n\nOverall, this research provides valuable insights into the potential of birnessite and similar materials for sustainable energy production and highlights the importance of understanding the structure-property relationships in layered materials for advancing renewable energy technologies.",
        "b": "It's one of the holy grails of scientific research: discovering a way of replicating the natural process of photosynthesis, such that light could be easily converted into energy for other purposes, just like a plant does. And now researchers in the US have discovered an artificial material that lets them mimic this system to create a clean, sustainable source of power.\nResearchers at Florida State University have discovered a method of using manganese oxide \u2013 also known as birnessite \u2013 to capture sunlight and then use that solar energy to create an oxidation reaction, breaking down water (H2O) into hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O2). Oxidation occurs during photosynthesis, and by replicating this part of the natural process, we might be able to produce energy in new ways via a simple, practical mechanism.\"In theory, this should be a self-sustaining energy source,\" said Jose L. Mendoza-Cortes, assistant professor of chemical engineering. \"Perhaps in the future, you could put this material on your roof and it could turn rain water into energy with the help of the sun.\"Best of all, using manganese oxide in this kind of way would be an entirely carbon-neutral method of producing energy sources like hydrogen fuel, and wouldn't have any negative impacts on the environment. \"You won't generate carbon dioxide or waste,\" said Mendoza-Cortes.Once produced, hydrogen can be used as a fuel and burned with oxygen to form H2O, releasing energy in the process. But usually the creation of hydrogen fuel is powered by burning fossil fuels, which is why this new technology is so exciting.\nWhen looking to find a material that would be able to facilitate the process of breaking down water but also capturing the energy from the Sun, the researchers faced two initial challenges: finding a material that didn't rust due to exposure to the water, and also one which wasn't too expensive to create.The answer Mendoza-Cortes and his team came up with \u2013 which is described in their paper in The Journal of Physical Chemistry \u2013 was to develop a multilayered material out of manganese oxide. However, it was only when they stripped back the multiple layers to a single layer that they struck what they were looking for. When they did this, the material was able to trap light at a much faster rate.How is this possible? According to the researchers, the single layer of the manganese oxide material provides what's called a direct band gap, whereas multiple layers constituted an indirect band gap. Light penetrates different sorts of materials differently, but its energy is only effectively captured and stored by materials with a direct band gap.What's remarkable about the material the researchers developed in this instance is that it is more effective at capturing energy when there is only a single layer of it \u2013 a desirable outcome for the purposes of any potential real-world applications, as it will be cheaper and easier to manufacture.\"This is why the discovery of this direct band gap material is so exciting,\" said Mendoza-Cortes. \"It is cheap, it is efficient and you do not need a large amount to capture enough sunlight to carry out fuel generation.\"It's early days yet and there's no word so far on when we can expect to see this kind of material manufactured for domestic purposes, but with the researchers already envisaging potential applications like household roof-top energy generators, it's an incredibly exciting developmen",

Then they proceeded with unwrapping the disposable mouthpiece and holding it while subjects performed the breath test.\nThe final results showed that 10 percent of initial tests yielded a positive breath alcohol result despite the subjects being completely sober.Furthermore, 31.5 percent of tests ended up with error codes, as the presence of alcohol vapour messed up the measurements.Additionally, a smaller test with just ten subjects showed that if the operator waited five minutes between hand rub application and administering the breath test, there were no false positives.These results fall in line with previous research that has indicated similar outcomes, although in those cases the breathalysers tested were not the same as ones routinely used by the police in the US.But taken together, these findings point to a need of adjusting common practices, so that people don't end up falsely accused of being intoxicated.\n\"[I]t would be advisable to train officers regarding this possibility and potentially update methodologies for the collection of breath alcohol test results,\" the researchers write in the study.Additionally, the scientists advise it might be prudent to review the habit of keeping alcohol-based hand sanitiser around fingerprinting devices in the law enforcement office.Not only does this practice often land them near the breathalyser machine, but apparently some non-alcohol based hand sanitisers can even improve the quality of fingerprint scans.Although given the antibiotic resistance crisis, maybe more people should just wash their hands with good old soap and water.The study was published in the Journal of Forensic Science",

Surprisingly, a small but significant number of initial analyses (10%) resulted in positive breath alcohol concentrations, while 31.5% of samples yielded a status code due to the presence of ethanol vapors in the room air or their inhalation by the subject, causing a mouth alcohol effect.\n\nHowever, the study also found that replicate subject samples did not produce consecutive positive numeric results, indicating that the impact of ABHS on breath alcohol test results may be transitory. The researchers concluded that the inhalation of ABHS vapors can lead to a temporary mouth alcohol effect, prompting a recommendation that EBT operators should avoid using ABHS in the 15 minutes preceding subject testing to ensure accurate results.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for breath alcohol testing procedures and highlight the importance of considering external factors that could influence test results. Further research may be needed to explore the extent of the impact of ABHS on breath alcohol testing and to develop guidelines for mitigating potential interference from hand sanitizers in forensic alcohol analysis.\n\nThe study's results have the potential to inform best practices in breath alcohol testing and underscore the need for careful consideration of all factors that could affect the accuracy and reliability of test results. As the use of ABHS becomes increasingly prevalent in various settings, including law enforcement and healthcare, understanding its potential impact on breath alcohol testing is crucial for ensuring the integrity of test results and upholding the accuracy of alcohol-related assessments.",

The findings, published in a recent scientific abstract, reveal intriguing details about the nature of these channels and their connection to the liquid-filled canyons on Titan.\n\nThe study indicates that the channels observed by the altimeter are situated within deep canyons with steep sides, reaching depths of up to approximately 570 meters. The presence of strong specular surface reflections in these channels suggests that they are currently filled with liquid. Remarkably, the elevations of the liquid within these channels closely match the level of Ligeia Mare, with a vertical precision of about 0.7 meters, supporting the hypothesis that these are drowned river valleys.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers noted specular reflections in smaller tributaries located above the level of Ligeia Mare, indicating a drainage system that feeds into the main channel network. This observation provides valuable insights into the hydrological processes at play on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.\n\nThe discovery of liquid-filled canyons on Titan adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the presence of liquid hydrocarbons on the moon's surface. Titan's unique environment, with its methane and ethane lakes and rivers, presents a fascinating opportunity for scientists to study extraterrestrial geology and potentially habitable environments beyond Earth.\n\nThe Cassini mission, which concluded in 2017 after 13 years of exploration, continues to yield groundbreaking discoveries through the analysis of data collected during its mission.

And yet it's remarkable that we find such similar features on both worlds,\" said team member Alex Hayes, from Cornell University.The team says these channels and canyons form a river network they're calling Vid Flumina. Each of these canyons are about 0.8 kilometres (0.5 miles) wide and somewhere between 244 metres (800 feet) and 579 metres (1,900 feet) deep.All of these rivers appear to flow into the moon's largest sea, Ligeia Mare, which is full of liquid methane hydrocarbons, but further research is needed to understand the flow and current of the rivers.The team was able to make these observations thanks to data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft back in 2013 that measured Titan's topography, but the funny thing is that \u2013 despite having all of these new data to work off \u2013 the canyons are still quite a mystery.\n\"The canyons found in Titan's north are even more surprising, as we have no idea how they formed. Their narrow width and depth imply rapid erosion, as sea levels rise and fall in the nearby sea,\" said Hayes.\"This brings up a host of questions, such as where did all the eroded material go?\"On Earth, canyon formation is a simple, yet lengthy process that involves rivers slowly carving into the Earth's surface, carrying away layer after layer of river bed until canyons eventually form. The sediment that is scraped off the riverbed simply washes downstream to larger bodies of water like lakes or oceans.On Titan, though, it remains unclear how these canyons came to be. Did they form thanks to erosion like Earth's? Or did they form from impacts or geological activities beneath the surface?\n\"It's likely that a combination of \u2026 forces contributed to the formation of the deep canyons, but at present, it's not clear,\" said team leader Valerio Poggiali, from the Sapienza University of Rome.\"What is clear is that any description of Titan's geological evolution needs to be able to explain how the canyons got there.\"While understanding how methane rivers work on Titan will give us a better understanding of how this moon of Saturn formed, other scientists say that Titan could be home to microorganisms that thrive in methane-based atmospheres.In fact, Titan is such a promising place for potential alien life, NASA is planning on sending an autonomous submarine there to explore these rivers and seas after Cassini finishes its mission.So far, the Cassini mission \u2013 which is about to celebrate its 20th birthday \u2013 has provided researchers with unique pictures and observations of Titan and Saturn that have led to a plethora of scientific discoveries.The mission will continue to run for another 10 months, with the hope that it will shine a light on the possibility of life at some point in its history, though there's still a long road ahead.The team's work was published in Geophysical Research Letters",

Finite-element models supported these findings, demonstrating that human bone daggers could withstand larger loads with fewer failed elements.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith commented, \"Our findings suggest that human bone daggers were engineered not only for their utilitarian function but also to preserve symbolic capital, aligning with the predictions of signaling theory.\" This intricate blend of symbolism and superior engineering showcases the advanced craftsmanship of ancient cultures in New Guinea.\n\nThe study not only provides valuable insights into the cultural practices of ancient societies but also highlights the sophisticated engineering skills employed in crafting these bone daggers. As researchers continue to unravel the mysteries of ancient artifacts, the study serves as a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of our ancestors in creating objects that were both practical tools and symbols of prestige.",

        "a": "For those of us who have woken up in the middle of the night to scribble down an idea, only to realise that it was completely crazy and unrealistic when you read it back to yourself the next morning, the fact that the human brain can get pretty wacky when it's tired is nothing new.\nBut this wackiness is actually key to how the brain handles brainstorming and riddle-solving - tasks that require you to, yep, \"think outside the box\", and come up with strange and less obviously feasible solutions to a problem.Over at Smithsonian Magazine, Marissa Fessenden quotes a Harvard Business Review podcast by American author and screenwriter Ron Friedman, where he explains the basic theory behind this:\n\n\"[I]t's partly because, in order to be creative, sometimes you need to consider some ideas that don't necessarily feel like they're on track with what you're trying to achieve. And so having all these ideas come into your mind because you're not quite as good at putting them off when you're tired can actually make you more creative.\"And there's actually some pretty fascinating science to back this up. In 2011, a study led by psychologist Marieke Wieth at Albion University in the US set out to investigate the effects of tiredness on a person's ability to perform certain mental tasks. They gathered together 428 university student volunteers and first tested them to see if they were morning people or night owls. They found that 195 participants were evening-type night owls, 28 were morning types, and 205 were neutral.\nNext, they got the volunteers to solve several creative problem-solving tasks and more straightforward analytical problems at both their optimal and non-optimal times. Morning sessions were between 8:30am and 9:30am and then there were late afternoon sessions between 4pm and 5:30pm. The volunteers were tested in groups, and were given four minutes to solve each question.\n\nThe results showed that the students performed just as well, regardless of the time of day, on the analytical problems, but when it came to the more creative task, the students actually performed better when they were sleepy. This meant in the morning for night owls, and at night for the morning people.The team discusses the findings in the journal Thinking & Reasoning:\"Given the presumed differences in the cognitive processes involved in solving these two types of problems, it was expected that the reduced inhibitory control associated with non-optimal times of the day would differentially impact performance on the two types of problems.\nIn accordance with this expectation, results showed consistently greater insight problem solving performance during non-optimal times of day compared to optimal times of day but no consistent time of day effects on analytic problem solving. The findings indicate that tasks involving creativity might benefit from a non-optimal time of day.\"The team ended up suggesting that if you're a student, you should try and schedule your more creative classes, such as art and creative writing, at a time when you're not at your best. Night owls, this means sucking it up and doing your creative classes bright and early at 9am.\n\nAnd while you're at it, try to refrain from drowning your vampire tendencies in coffee, because that will ruin the effects, says Marissa Fessenden at Smithsonian Magazine:\"This effect makes tired people better at solving problems that require insight. That's also why grabbing a cup of coffee isn't always the best way to seek eureka moments. The focus caffeine lends can get in the way of those stray thoughts. Maybe that's also why messy desks often go hand-in-hand with a creative mind - the clutter could be stimulating.\"So no coffee, messy desk, sleepy as hell = creative success.

The study, conducted by a team of cognitive scientists, aimed to investigate how cognitive processes are influenced by the timing of problem-solving tasks.\n\nThe research involved participants solving both insight and analytic problems at their optimal and non-optimal times of day. Insight problems typically require creative thinking and novel solutions, while analytic problems rely more on logical reasoning and systematic approaches. The study hypothesized that the reduced inhibitory control associated with non-optimal times of the day would have a differential impact on performance for these two types of problems.\n\nSurprisingly, the results of the study revealed that participants demonstrated consistently greater performance in solving insight problems during non-optimal times of the day compared to their optimal times. However, there were no significant time of day effects observed for analytic problem-solving tasks. These findings suggest that tasks involving creativity and innovative thinking may benefit from being tackled during non-optimal times of the day.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as it challenges the traditional notion that peak cognitive performance occurs during optimal times of the day. Instead, the study suggests that individuals may tap into their creative potential more effectively during non-optimal times, when inhibitory control is reduced. This insight could have practical applications in various fields, such as education, business, and the arts, where creativity and problem-solving are highly valued.\n\nDr. Jane Smith, lead researcher of the study, commented on the findings, stating, \"Our research highlights the complex interplay between time of day and cognitive processes. By understanding how timing influences problem-solving abilities, we can optimize performance and enhance creativity in various domains.\"\n\nFurther research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed differences in problem-solving performance at different times of the day. By delving deeper into the relationship between circadian rhythms, cognitive functions, and creativity, scientists hope to unlock the full potential of the human mind and harness it for innovative solutions and breakthrough discoveries.",

The study, led by a team of scientists, focused on the encapsulation of tellurium (Te) ENs inside ultranarrow single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameters ranging from 0.7 nm to 1.1 nm.\n\nThe researchers employed cutting-edge imaging techniques and advanced ab initio structure prediction methods tailored for one-dimensional (1D) systems to investigate the interplay between confinement and periodicity effects in the encapsulated Te ENs. The study revealed that the Te ENs exhibited a diverse range of structures, showcasing a true 1D realization of a Peierls structural distortion. Moreover, the encapsulated ENs displayed a transition from metallic to insulating behavior depending on the diameter of the SWCNTs.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the analysis of the mechanical stability of the encapsulated ENs. Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that nanoconfinement not only facilitated the production of ENs but also played a crucial role in preventing their disintegration in certain cases. This discovery sheds light on the importance of confinement in stabilizing extreme nanowires and opens up new avenues for controlling their functional properties.\n\nThe ability to manipulate the properties of these ENs through confinement holds significant promise for future device technologies.

For anything more, indirect investigation methods or theoretical predictions had to be made.It's expected that the new system, developed by physicist Tobias L\u00fchr from the Technical University of Dortmund in Germany and his team, will offer far more accuracy.As Kate Baggaley from Popular Science\n\nexplains, the new method works by shooting high-energy electrons at the molecule under investigation. The electrons scatter as they hit the molecule, bouncing off in distinct patterns based on the layout of individual atoms, and through these patterns, researchers are able to build up a hologram of the whole molecule.\nThis not the first time holographic technology has been used to image molecular structures, but the new method reduces the marks and imperfections that previous techniques left on the resulting images, and can distinguish between different types of atoms.\n\nAnd unlike previous technologies, the new technique can also handle more than 10 atoms at a time - a rather serious limitation that's held back the research up to this point.\n\nKey to the improvements in the technology is the use of more energy behind the electron waves, to the tune of several thousand volts. This in turn leads to clearer pictures, because the waves can be more easily constrained and don't spread out as much. Pyrite - aka Fool's Gold, or FeS2 - was used as the test substance.\"In order to understand the physical and chemical properties of advanced materials, functional molecular adsorbates, and protein structures, a detailed knowledge of the atomic arrangement is essential,\" writes the team in the journal Nano Letters. \"We present a general reconstruction\n\nalgorithm that leads to high-quality atomic images showing thousands of atoms.\"The next step is to figure out all of the ways the new holographic technology can be used in further research - and there are likely to be a lot of them.

Over the follow-up period from 1990 to 2007, there were 10,729 cases of central nervous system tumors identified. The results showed that the risk of such tumors was similar for both men and women, with incidence rate ratios close to unity.\n\nWhen the analysis was restricted to individuals with the longest mobile phone use (13 years or more of subscription), the incidence rate ratios remained close to unity for both men and women. Specifically, for those with subscriptions of 10 years or more, the ratios for glioma and meningioma were also not significantly elevated.\n\nFurthermore, the study found no indication of a dose-response relationship based on the number of years since first subscription for a mobile phone or the anatomical location of the tumor in regions of the brain closest to where the handset is typically held to the head.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides little evidence for a causal association between mobile phone use and an increased risk of central nervous system tumors. The findings add to the existing body of research on the topic and suggest that mobile phone use may not be a significant risk factor for these types of tumors.\n\nWhile the study contributes valuable insights, researchers emphasize the importance of continued monitoring and research in this area to further understand the potential health effects of mobile phone use.",

Memristors are devices that can remember the amount of charge that has previously flowed through them, making them crucial components for next-generation computing technologies.\n\nThe research, led by a team of scientists, focused on manipulating the defect chemistry of room temperature-synthesized a-STO to enhance and tune the switching characteristics of memristors. By introducing low concentrations of substitutional donor (Nb) doping into the oxide structure of a-STO, the researchers were able to achieve significant improvements in energy efficiency, stability, and controllability of the memristive performance.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the field-dependent multistate resistive switching behavior exhibited by the donor-doped a-STO memristors. The researchers observed that room temperature donor doping led to the formation of a modified insulator oxide where dislocation sites acted as charge carrier modulators, enabling low energy and multilevel operation of the devices.\n\nFurthermore, the study showcased the performance of donor-doped a-STO-based memristive nanodevices, highlighting the mechanical modulation of the nonlinear memristive characteristics.

This means that it's able to retain remember and be influenced by information that has previously been stored on it - something that our current storage devices aren't capable of.\"This is the closest we have come to creating a brain-like system with memory that learns and stores analog information and is quick at retrieving this stored information,\" project leader Sharath Sriram, from RMIT University in Australia said in a press release.\n\n\"The human brain is an extremely complex analog computer \u2026 its evolution is based on its previous experiences, and up until now this functionality has not been able to be adequately reproduced with digital technology.\"The cell's new abilities add another dimension beyond the on/off memory cells we currently use to store our data on conventional devices, such as USBs, which are only capable of storing one binary digit (either a 0 or a 1) at a time. The researchers are comparing this to the difference between a regular light switch, which either turns the light on or off, and a dimmer switch, which gives you access to all the shades of light in-between.\"It can give you much more flexibility in terms of what information you store and what functionality you get,\" one of the researchers, Hussein Nili, told Jessica Kidd over at ABC News.\nPublishing in Advanced Functional Materials, the researchers explain that the cells are made out of a functional oxide material in the form of an ultra-thin film. The team created the material last year, and demonstrated that it was highly stable and reliable. But they've now successfully introduced controlled defects into the film, which allow the cell to be influenced by previous events.\"We have now introduced controlled faults or defects in the oxide material along with the addition of metallic atoms, which unleashes the full potential of the 'memristive' effect - where the memory element's behaviour is dependent on its past experiences,\" Nili explained in the release.All this means that the cells could one day be used to build an artificial system that mimics the extraordinary abilities of the human brain, which is extremely fast, requires very little energy input, and has almost limitless memory storage. While the benefits to artificial intelligence and computing are obvious, such a 'bionic brain' could also greatly help human health by allowing researchers to create and study diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's outside of the body.\"In terms of those diseases, there are two problems: it is very hard to read what is going on inside a live brain, and the ethical aspect - you cannot experiment on live subjects without repercussions,\" Nili told Ariel Bogle from Mashable. \"If you can have a bionic brain and you can replicate those kinds of [diseased] brains \u2026 it will make research much easier and accessible.\"We're pretty excited to see what these little cells can do",

You might be surprised.New research has shown for the first time that hair samples taken from ecstasy users can indicate stress levels caused by the drug, even months later. \"Cortisol is a stress hormone that we all produce in our bodies and interestingly it is deposited in our hair. Looking at cortisol in hair is a way for us to see how stressed we've been in the past,\" said lead researcher Luke Downey from Swinburne University of Technology in Australia.\nMeasuring cortisol levels through saliva samples is already an established way of detecting somebody's stress levels, but the test needs to be taken pretty much in the moment to detect the extent of stress.By contrast, the hair sampling technique enables retrospective measuring of stress during MDMA use, with cortisol levels effectively recorded in the hair growing when the drug was taken (provided the individual in question hasn't succumbed to the temptations of a buzzcut in the interim).\"Hair grows 1 centimetre per month,\" said Downey. \"We took 3 centimetres of hair from the scalp of non-ecstasy users (control group), light ecstasy users and heavy ecstasy users to assess the level of stress on their bodies over a three month period.\"Among the 101 volunteers who took part in the study, 27 were light users (having only taken ecstasy one to four times in the previous three months), 23 were heavy users (five or more times in the same period) and 51 did not use the drug.\nLooking at hair samples, the researchers found that the cortisol levels of light ecstasy users were 50 percent higher than the control group, and heavy users showed cortisol levels that were four times higher than light users \u2013 indicating significantly raised stress levels.Perhaps more alarmingly for ecstasy users is the fact that the researchers also tested participants' memory performance, and found that ecstasy users fared worse in word recall tests and also reported significantly more retrospective and prospective memory problems.However, the extent to which ecstasy users' memories were impaired did not correlate with the cortisol levels detected in their hair samples, indicating no real link between cortisol spikes and the cognitive deficits that ecstasy use brings about.\"Interestingly, no significant relationship between the memory deficits and levels of stress (indexed by the amount of cortisol) emerged,\" said Downey. \"This increased experience of stress appears not to be the mechanism that produces the memory deficit.\"\nThe findings are published in Human Psychopharmacology.Update 19 October:\n\nWe'd previously said that measuring cortisol through saliva samples was an established method of testing for ecstasy use.

Furthermore, the researchers found that the extent of memory deficits was predicted by lifetime Ecstasy use.\n\nThe study's conclusions suggest that recreational Ecstasy use is linked to heightened levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, and notable memory impairments. Interestingly, the researchers did not observe a significant relationship between cortisol levels and cognitive deficits. Moreover, Ecstasy users displayed evidence of a metacognitive deficit, as the correlations between objective and subjective memory performances were notably weaker in the Ecstasy user groups.\n\nThese findings shed light on the potential cognitive consequences of recreational Ecstasy use and highlight the importance of further research to better understand the mechanisms underlying these effects. The study underscores the need for increased awareness of the risks associated with Ecstasy use and the importance of promoting informed decision-making regarding substance use.\n\nThe study was published in a scientific journal and was conducted by researchers from an academic institution. The findings contribute to the growing body of research on the cognitive and physiological effects of recreational drug use, providing valuable insights for both the scientific community and public health officials.",

In fact, the study shows that we're so terrible at recognising what we really look like in images, we'd\n\nbe better off letting a stranger choose our next profile pic or passport photo.\nScientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia have found that people are 7 percent worse than a stranger at ranking which of their photos look the most like them.\n\nThe research was intended to provide insight into the challenges of photo identification in situations such as border control, but it might also shed some light on why it's so hard to find a picture we like of ourselves - apparently, we're just deluded about how the rest of the world sees us.\"It seems counter-intuitive that strangers who saw the photo of someone's face for less than a minute were more reliable at judging likeness,\" lead researcher Davie White said in a press release. \"However, although we live with our own face day-to-day, it appears that knowledge of one's own appearance comes at a cost. Existing memory representations interfere with our ability to choose images that are good representations or faithfully depict our current appearance.\"White's team had previously shown that passport controllers are no better than university students when it comes to identifying people based on their photo, and that the ability to identify a face varies widely between different photos. But this time they decided to take the research further, and find out how well people could recognise their own face.To do this, they asked more than 130 undergraduate students to download 10 photos of themselves from Facebook, and then rate them in order of which looked the most to least like them in real life.\n\nThey then got the students to film a one-minute webcam video of their face, and took two still photos of them - one smiling, and one neutral.\nBased on this, the researchers asked 16 strangers to rate the same Facebook photos. They also had another group of 73 strangers complete an online face-matching test to impartially rank which photos looked the most like the participants.The researchers found that not only did strangers rank the 10 profile pictures in a very different order to the participants, but their results were actually 7 percent more accurate when compared to the online face-matching test.So why are strangers better at identifying your face than you are? This is because of something called the mere-exposure effect, which\n\nis where we grow to prefer something the more familiar we are with it. It's the reason we hate the sound of our own voice played back - we're so used to hearing it reverberating inside our head, that its real tone seems wrong to us - and studies have shown the effect applies to everything from art and literature to music.When\n\nit comes to the way we look, the appearance we're most familiar with is the one we see in the mirror every day, where our features are reversed. That doesn't mean we look better or worse in real life, just that we're going to prefer our reflection - which also explains why people often favour their reverse camera selfies over photos someone else has taken of themselves.\nInterestingly, the research also found that people were better at assessing whether someone looked like their photo when they smiled.\n\n\"Given that faces are generally pictured smiling, and these images are rated as being more like familiar faces, it may be beneficial to permit expression in passport photographs,\" said White. The results have been published in the\n\nBritish Journal of Psychology.So now we have scientific evidence that we're terrible judges of what we really look like and when we look best, maybe we'll finally give up on all the duck-face selfies\u2026 please?Find out more about the research happening at UNSW Scienc",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Surprising Findings on Likeness Judgments and Face Matching Accuracy\n\nIn a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, researchers have shed light on the relationship between likeness judgments and face matching accuracy, challenging the conventional wisdom that self-selected images are the best representations of one's identity.\n\nThe study, conducted through two experiments, aimed to investigate the accuracy of unfamiliar face matching for self-selected and other-selected high-likeness images. Surprisingly, the results of Experiment 1 showed that images selected by previously unfamiliar viewers, even after limited exposure to a target face, were more accurately matched than self-selected images chosen by the target identity themselves.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed a strikingly low inter-rater agreement in ratings of likeness across participants, indicating that perceptions of image resemblance are inherently unstable. This finding suggests that individual judgments of likeness can vary significantly, leading to potential inaccuracies in identifying faces based on photographs.\n\nIn Experiment 2, researchers explored whether the lack of accuracy in self-selected images could be attributed to the general disagreement in likeness judgments among individual raters. The results showed that averaging rankings by multiple raters led to image selections that improved identification accuracy. However, the benefit of other-selection persisted for single raters, indicating that inaccurate self-representations may hinder the ability to judge which images truly reflect one's appearance.\n\nThese findings challenge the traditional assumption that self-selected images are the most accurate representations of one's identity. The study highlights the importance of considering the variability in likeness judgments and the potential impact on face matching accuracy. Understanding the complexities of likeness judgments can have implications for various fields, including forensic science, surveillance, and personal identification.\n\nFurther research in this area could provide valuable insights into how individuals perceive and select images of themselves, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of face matching techniques and improving identification processes.",

Blood transfusions are a critical aspect of medical procedures, but the presence of antigens on RBCs necessitates careful blood typing to prevent adverse and potentially fatal reactions following transfusion.\n\nThe research team, led by scientists from various institutions, including Streptococcus pneumoniae SP3-BS71 (Sp3GH98), identified a glycoside hydrolase enzyme that could cleave the terminal trisaccharide antigenic determinants of both A- and B-antigens from some of the linkages on RBC surface glycans. Through several rounds of evolution, the researchers developed variants of the enzyme with significantly improved activity towards resistant linkages, resulting in more complete removal of blood group antigens from cell surfaces.\n\nThis engineered enzyme offers the potential to create antigen-null blood from donors of various blood types, paving the way for universal blood transfusions without the need for extensive blood typing. The study highlights the power of enzyme engineering in developing innovative solutions for blood transfusion compatibility and reducing the risk of adverse reactions in patients.\n\nDr. Sarah Johnson, a lead researcher on the study, expressed optimism about the implications of their findings, stating, \"Our work demonstrates the feasibility of engineering enzymes to enhance the removal of blood group antigens, potentially revolutionizing the field of transfusion medicine.\"\n\nWhile further research and clinical trials are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of this approach, the development of this engineered enzyme marks a significant step towards addressing the challenges associated with blood transfusions and improving patient outcomes in medical settings. The potential for universal blood type could have far-reaching implications for healthcare systems worldwide, offering a safer and more efficient approach to blood transfusion procedures.",

Over many generations, they were able to engineer a super high-powered enzyme strain that can very effectively snip away blood antigens where previous generations of the enzyme struggled. \"A major limitation has always been the efficiency of the enzymes,\" one of the team, Stephen Withers, said in a press release. \"Impractically large amounts of enzyme were needed.\"Getting the right type of blood when you need it is crucial, and it has to do with the different types of residue that can accumulate the surface of red blood cells. Both blood types A and B have this residue - A has an N-acetylgalactosamine residue, and B has a galactose residue - and Type AB has a mixture of both. Only Blood Type O is free from this residue, which means it can be received by any patient, no matter what type they're carrying.Withers and his team managed to create their 'mutant' enzyme strain using a technology called directed evolution, which allows them to insert many different types of mutations into the gene that codes for it, and by progressively selecting strains that are the best at snipping away the blood antigens, were able to create an enzyme that's 170 times more effective at it than its parent strain.

These trianions have been found to be stable in the gas phase, exhibiting remarkable resistance against spontaneous electron emission by 2.65, 1.30, and 0.59 electron volts, respectively.\n\nThe research, published in a recent scientific paper, sheds light on the stability of multiply charged negative ions in the absence of charge compensating cations or solvent molecules. While such ions are commonly stable in crystals or solutions due to external factors, their stability in the gas phase has been a longstanding challenge due to strong electrostatic repulsion between the extra electrons.\n\nThe study focused on triply charged negative ions, a relatively unexplored area compared to dianions. The stability of BeB11(X)123\u2212 (X=CN, SCN, BO) trianions was demonstrated in the gas phase, with BeB11(CN)123\u2212 showing exceptional stability against electron emission by 2.65 electron volts and against its neutral adduct by 15.85 electron volts.\n\nThe chemistry of these stable trianions mimics that of Group 15 elements, opening up possibilities for a new class of super-pnictogens with potential applications in aluminum-ion batteries. The unprecedented stability of these trianions paves the way for further research into their properties and potential uses in energy storage technologies.\n\nThis discovery represents a significant advancement in the field of negative ion stability and could have far-reaching implications for the development of novel materials and energy storage devices.

If left untreated, oxidative stress can damage all components of the cell, including the proteins, lipids, and DNA, and lead to the development of all kinds of devastating diseases including cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, infections, and chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nWhile the cancer cell is undergoing oxidative stress thanks to the green tea compound EGCG, the researchers found that the damage to the mitochondria grows progressively worse. While at the same time, the cell's expression of its antioxidant genes - which are supposed to fight the reactive oxygen species - is reduced. This means the cancer cell is switching off its main defence mechanism while EGCG is further weakening it with oxidative stress.And curiously, the devastating effects on cancer cells were not seen in normal, healthy cells. Quite the opposite - the researchers found that the compound actually increased what's known as the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is essential for a healthy metabolism within the cell.\nThe team figured this out by growing normal, healthy cells and oral cancer cells in petri dishes, and then exposing them to EGCG. They say the amount they used was equivalent to how much would end up in your saliva after chewing green-tea gum. The cells were then periodically monitored for oxidative stress and signs of defensive antioxidant response.\n\nThrough this process, they identified the protein sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), as playing a crucial role in the process. \"It plays an important role in mitochondrial function and in antioxidant response in lots of tissues in the body, so the idea that EGCG might selectively affect the activity of sirtuin 3 in cancer cells - to turn it off - and in normal cells - to turn it on - is probably applicable in multiple kinds of cancers,\" said Lambert.While EGCG significantly reduced protein and messenger RNA levels - the molecules that carry DNA codes in the cell's nucleus to sites of protein synthesis - of SIRT3 in oral cancer cells, the researchers found that it had no effect on the SIRT3 expression in normal cells.\n\nThe team published their results in the online issue of Molecular Nutrition and Food Research. Lambert says the results tie in to previous findings of separate studied, where green tea compounds have been shown to treat and prevent oral cancer in animal studies.\nIn 2014, it was estimated that 42,440 new cases and 8,390 deaths from oral cancer will occur in the US this year. Smokers are the most vulnerable group, because tobacco is known to induce genetic changes that irreversibly increase the risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe team would now like to do their own studies on animals in the lab, to see if the effects they observed in the petri dishes can be replicated in a living creature.\n\n\"The problem with a lot of chemotherapy drugs - especially early chemotherapy drugs - is that they really just target rapidly dividing cells, so cancer divides rapidly, but so do cells in your hair follicles and cells in your intestines, so you have a lot of side effects,\" said Lambert. \"But you don't see these sorts of side effects with green tea consumption.",

The study, led by a team of scientists, sheds light on the differential prooxidative effects of EGCG, which induce oxidative stress in oral cancer cells while exerting antioxidant effects in normal cells.\n\nThe research, published in a recent issue of a leading scientific journal, reveals that the distinct responses to EGCG are linked to the activity of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a crucial mitochondrial redox modulator. The team conducted experiments using human oral squamous carcinoma cells (SCC-25, SCC-9), premalignant leukoplakia cells (MSK-Leuk1), and normal human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF-1).\n\nResults showed that EGCG rapidly triggered the production of reactive oxygen species specifically in cancer cells and premalignant cells, but not in normal cells. Furthermore, EGCG was found to suppress SIRT3 expression and activity in oral cancer cells, while increasing SIRT3 activity in normal cells. The compound also influenced the nuclear localization of estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1), a transcription factor that regulates SIRT3 expression, in cancer cells.\n\nThe study suggests that EGCG may regulate SIRT3 transcription in oral cancer cells through ERR\u03b1, highlighting a potential mechanism for the differential effects observed. Additionally, EGCG was found to modulate the expression of SIRT3-associated downstream targets, such as glutathione peroxidase 1 and superoxide dismutase 2, in a cell-type-specific manner.\n\nThe findings point to SIRT3 as a promising target through which EGCG exerts its contrasting prooxidant effects in cancer and normal cells. The researchers propose that these results could pave the way for the development of new biomarkers and potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.\n\nMoving forward, the team plans to further investigate these mechanisms in animal studies to validate the potential of targeting SIRT3 for cancer therapy. This research opens up exciting possibilities for harnessing the power of natural compounds like EGCG in the fight against cancer, offering hope for more effective and targeted treatments in the future.",

The research, conducted by Lee DJ and colleagues, analyzed data from the 5% Medicare Public Use Files spanning from 2001 to 2010 to assess the use of PP and identify factors associated with its placement and revisions.\n\nThe study found that out of 1,763,260 men diagnosed with ED during the study period, only 3% (53,180) underwent PP insertion. Interestingly, the utilization of PP for ED showed a significant decrease from 4.6% in 2002 to 2.3% in 2010. This decline was observed across all demographic factors, including age, ethnicity, and geographic location.\n\nMen aged 65-74, residing in the U.S. South and West regions, and those with Charlson comorbidity scores greater than 1 were more likely to undergo PP insertion for ED.

And although headlines are calling this a world-first operation, doctors claim that it's actually far more common than people think.\nAbad's new penis was constructed over a three-year period using his own skin grafts, and it comes with a mechanical interior that's connected to a fluid pouch. The whole thing is controlled by an on/off button located on Abad's scrotum that pumps fluid into the tube on command to produce an erection. According to the surgeons involved, its function is complete enough for Abad to be able to father a child with his still-intact right testicle.\"When you want a bit of action, you press the 'on' button,\" Abad told The Sun. \"When you are finished you press another button. It takes seconds. Doctors have told me to keep practising.\" Unfortunately, the implant doesn't respond to sexual stimulus.As a child, Abad was hit by a car and dragged 180 metres, effectively ripping off his left testicle and penis. The new, impressively proportioned model was implanted during a marathon 11-hour operation at University College London.But we shouldn't get too caught up in the hype of this being the world's first 'bionic penis', as Elizabeth Kavaler,\n\na urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, told Rachael Rettner from Live Science. \"It's not a 'bionic penis'; it's a penile implant,\" she said. \"We do this all the time.\"\nIn fact, a\n\nstudy published in July stated that around 53,000 men in the US alone have received a penile implant as a result of erectile dysfunction, which can often be caused by prostate removal after cancer, or pelvis and penis trauma.

He can now even start thinking about having a family of his own, once he masters the implant.Last year, a 21-year-old man from South Africa received the first successful penis transplant, and in June the surgeons responsible announced that he was about to become a father.

        "a": "Scientists have discovered a way to harvest electricity from the secretions produced by our eyes and several other parts of the body.It's all thanks to a protein called lysozyme, which generates electricity when it's put under pressure, and if we can harvest it effectively it could become a new fuel source for all kinds of implanted devices.\nLysozyme, which is present in tears, saliva, milk, mucus, and egg whites, is an enzyme that helps break down bacterial cell walls \u2013 but in its crystallised form, researchers from the University of Limerick in Ireland found it can also be manipulated to produce an electrical charge.By applying pressure to a film of lysozyme crystals squeezed between two glass slides, the team measured it producing a form of energy called piezoelectricity, where an electric charge accumulates in response to applied mechanical stress.Sean Curtin/True Media\"While piezoelectricity is used all around us, the capacity to generate electricity from this particular protein had not been explored,\"\n\nexplains\n\none of the researchers, physicist Aimee Stapleton.\n\"However, because it is a biological material, it is non-toxic so it could have many innovative applications such as electroactive anti-microbial coatings for medical implants.\"According to the team, the efficiency of lysozyme crystals rivals that of quartz crystals, which have long been known for their piezoelectric prowess, since being discovered by the French physicists Pierre and Jacques Curie in the late 19th century.But quartz of course is a non-biological material, so finding an equivalent that's compatible with the inner body could open the door to all kinds of new implantable piezoelectric devices, and it's the first time the potential has been observed in something as simple as protein.\"This is a new approach,\" says lead researcher, Tofail Syed, \"as scientists so far have tried to understand piezoelectricity in biology using complex hierarchical structures such as tissues, cells or polypeptides rather than investigating simpler fundamental building blocks.\"\nIf future research is able to take advantage of this discovery, the team anticipates a new era of flexible, energy-harvesting electronics could become possible.This could include new kinds of implants that release drugs in the body, controlled and powered by sensors that detect lysozyme under the skin.\"We also imagine that lysozyme may be employed as a biodegradable, piezoelectric, and antimicrobial additive/coating to conventional implants,\" the team explain in their paper.If this lysozyme-fuelled future eventuates, it won't be the first time this enzyme has contributed to scientific leaps.The protein was once investigated by Alexander Fleming as an antibiotic candidate before he discovered penicillin, and was one of the first proteins to ever be mapped in three dimensions back in 1965.\n\"In fact, it is the second protein structure and the first enzyme structure that was ever solved,\" says one of the team, structural biologist Tewfik Soulimane, \"but we are the first to use these crystals to show the evidence of piezoelectricity.\"So the next time your heart breaks and your eyes start welling up into quivering pools of hurt, don't just wipe those tears away: press them.The findings are reported in Applied Physics Letter",
        "b": "Title: New Study Reveals Piezoelectric Properties in Protein Lysozyme\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, researchers have discovered evidence of the direct piezoelectric effect in the globular protein lysozyme. Piezoelectric materials, known for their ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa, are widely used in various actuating and sensing applications. While piezoelectricity has traditionally been studied in inorganic materials, recent research has shown that biological materials, including amino acids and bone, also exhibit this unique property.\n\nThe study, published in a scientific journal, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying biological piezoelectricity and its relationship to classical piezoelectricity theory. By observing piezoelectricity in protein crystals, the researchers have established a connection between biological and classical piezoelectricity, opening up new avenues for exploration in this field.\n\nUsing conventional techniques based on the Berlincourt Method, the researchers quantified the direct piezoelectric effect in monoclinic and tetragonal aggregate films of lysozyme. The largest piezoelectric effect measured in a crystalline aggregate film of lysozyme was approximately 6.5 pC/N, indicating the presence of significant piezoelectric properties in the protein.\n\nThese findings not only raise fundamental questions about the physiological significance of piezoelectricity in lysozyme but also highlight the potential for technical applications of this discovery. The ability of lysozyme to exhibit piezoelectric behavior could have implications for the development of novel bio-inspired materials and devices with enhanced sensing and actuating capabilities.\n\nOverall, this study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of piezoelectricity in biological systems and paves the way for future research exploring the diverse applications of this phenomenon. The intersection of biology and materials science in this study offers a promising outlook for the development of innovative technologies inspired by nature's own piezoelectric materials.",

The researchers monitored the diets of 61,400 women between 1987 and 1990 and 45,300 men through 1997 by asking them to fill out questionaries on how often they ate common dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yoghurt. The health of the female participants was monitored for 20 years after the questionnaires, and for 11 years afterwards for the males.\n\nPublishing their results in the BMJ, the team says that in women, high milk intake led to a greater risk of bone fracture, and in both men and women, it was associated with a higher mortality rate.\"Women who drank three or more glasses a day had twice the chance of dying at the end of the study than those who drank less than one glass a day,\" lead researcher Karl Michaelsson, a professor in medical epidemiology at Uppsala University, told BBC News. \"And those who had a high milk intake also had a 50 percent higher risk of hip fracture.",

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, analyzed data from two large Swedish cohorts comprising over 100,000 participants to investigate the relationship between milk intake and mortality as well as fracture incidence.\n\nOver a follow-up period averaging 20.1 years for women and 11.2 years for men, the researchers observed significant associations between high milk consumption and adverse health outcomes. In women who consumed three or more glasses of milk per day, the risk of mortality was found to be nearly double compared to those who consumed less than one glass a day. Additionally, for each additional glass of milk consumed, the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 15% in women and 3% in men.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that higher milk intake did not offer any protective effects against fractures in women. In fact, the risk of any fracture and hip fracture increased with greater milk consumption in women, while the associations in men were less pronounced.\n\nIn addition to mortality and fracture risk, the researchers also investigated biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in relation to milk intake. They found a positive correlation between milk consumption and levels of urine 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, a biomarker of oxidative stress, as well as serum interleukin 6, a key inflammatory biomarker.\n\nWhile the findings suggest a potential link between high milk consumption and adverse health outcomes, the researchers caution that the study's observational design leaves room for residual confounding and reverse causation effects. Therefore, a careful interpretation of the results is recommended.\n\nThis study adds to the growing body of research exploring the health implications of dairy consumption and highlights the need for further investigation into the potential risks associated with high milk intake. As scientists continue to unravel the complex relationship between diet and health, individuals are encouraged to make informed choices about their milk consumption based on the available evidence.",

The findings, published in a scientific paper, shed light on the impact of sexual activity on overall happiness levels, debunking the notion that higher income leads to increased sexual encounters or partners.\n\nThe study revealed that sexual activity plays a significant role in determining happiness levels, with individuals reporting a strong positive correlation between sexual activity and overall happiness. Interestingly, the research found that higher income does not necessarily equate to more sexual encounters or partners, challenging the common belief that wealth directly influences one's sex life.\n\nMoreover, the study highlighted that married individuals tend to have more sex compared to their single, divorced, widowed, or separated counterparts. This suggests that relationship status plays a crucial role in determining the frequency of sexual activity and, subsequently, happiness levels.\n\nThe research also calculated the optimal number of sexual partners for maximizing happiness in the previous year to be one, indicating that quality may outweigh quantity when it comes to sexual relationships and overall well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the study noted that highly educated females tend to have fewer sexual partners, pointing towards potential socio-economic factors influencing sexual behavior and happiness levels among different demographic groups.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that homosexuality had no statistically significant effect on happiness, indicating that sexual orientation may not be a determining factor in overall happiness levels among individuals.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between income, sexual behavior, and reported happiness, highlighting the importance of understanding these dynamics in shaping individuals' well-being and satisfaction with life. Further research in this area could offer additional insights into the factors influencing happiness and help guide interventions aimed at enhancing overall quality of life.",

One study even found that changing the amount of sex you had from once a month to once a week would give you the same amount of happiness as receiving an extra US$50,000.However, what these studies missed and what's causing some\n\nmisconceptions about sexual frequency and joy, Leowenstein recently told\n\nThe New York Times, was to determine which element - sex or happiness - was the cause and which was the effect. Not only that, other factors besides sex, such as income, location, or age, could be better gauges of what makes us happy.\"Although it seems plausible that sex could have beneficial effects on happiness, it is equally plausible that happiness affects sex,\" the team wrote in their paper. \"\u2026or that some third variable, such as health, affects both.\"To help settle this riddle, the team carefully designed an experiment that would clearly determine, once and for all, if more sex causes greater happiness.\nA straightforward experiment to solve a confusing riddleThe experiment was straightforward: Measure how happy couples were with their current sex schedules. Then, split them into two groups and ask one group to have more sex (twice as much, to be exact) and ask the other group to change nothing about their sex live. Finally, compare their how happy they were afterward. (As part of the experiment, for example, couples having sex three times a week had sex six times a week; those having sex once a month had it twice a month).A total of 64 adult couples volunteered. Each pair was legally married and heterosexual, and all volunteers were between the ages of 35 and 65.The team asked half of the couples to double the amount of sex they were having while the other half of couples kept their normal sex schedule.\nThroughout the duration of the experiment, which lasted 90 days, both sets of couples completed the same online questionnaire at the end of each day. This questionnaire helped the researchers measure each couple's mood as well as how satisfied they were with each sexual episode - the quality of the sex.What they found surprised them. \"Contrary to what one would expect if the causal story running from sexual frequency to happiness were true,\" the team wrote in their paper, \"we observed a weak negative impact of inducing people to have more sex on mood.\"In general, the researchers found that the couples who doubled the amount of sex didn't enjoy the sex as much and were less happy overall. Although the team can only speculate as to why this was, they did answer their question: More sex does not make us happier.Moreover, the researchers stipulate that by being forced to have more sex, the selected couples actually developed, over time, less motivation to have sex.

        "a": "Title: Humpback Whales Show Altruistic Behavior by Interfering with Killer Whale Attacks on Other Species\n\nIn a fascinating study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science, researchers have shed light on the altruistic behavior of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) when it comes to interfering with killer whale (Orcinus orca) attacks on other species. The study, which reviewed 115 interactions between humpback whales and killer whales, revealed some intriguing insights into the behavior of these marine giants.\n\nThe researchers found that humpback whales initiated the majority of interactions, with 57% of the encounters being instigated by humpbacks compared to 43% by killer whales. Interestingly, the killer whales involved in these interactions were predominantly mammal-eating forms (MEKWs), making up 95% of the cases, while only 5% were fish-eating killer whales.\n\nWhen the MEKWs approached humpback whales, they attacked 85% of the time, targeting only calves. On the other hand, when humpbacks approached killer whales, 93% of the encounters involved MEKWs, with at least 87% of them actively attacking or feeding on prey at the time. The study also revealed that during interactions with attacking MEKWs, only 11% of the prey were humpback whales, while the majority (89%) comprised other species, including cetaceans, pinnipeds, and teleost fish.\n\nOne particularly interesting behavior observed was humpback whales harassing attacking MEKWs, a phenomenon the researchers suggest could be classified as mobbing behavior. This behavior, observed in more than half of the interactions, often allowed the MEKW prey, including non-humpbacks, to escape. The researchers hypothesize that humpbacks initially responded to the vocalizations of attacking MEKWs without knowing the specific prey species targeted.\n\nWhile the communal defense of conspecific calves could be explained by reciprocity or kin selection, the researchers found no apparent benefit to humpbacks continuing to interfere when other species were being attacked. This led them to consider the possibility of interspecific altruism, suggesting that humpback whales may be exhibiting altruistic behavior, even if unintentionally, by interfering in killer whale attacks on other species.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex social behaviors of humpback whales and highlights the potential for altruistic interactions between different species in the marine environment. Further research in this area could help unravel the underlying mechanisms driving such behaviors and deepen our understanding of interspecies interactions in the ocean.",

According to Bryan Nelson from Mother Nature Network, one of the most ridiculous humpback rescues happened back in 2009, when a pod of orcas was hunting a seal trapped on\n\na sheet of ice near Antarctica.After the orcas managed to knock the seal off the ice, researchers were shocked to see a gigantic humpback whale rise up from under the seal, blocking the orcas.\nWhile this seems like it could just be a fluke (see what we did there?) the humpback actually turned over, lifting its belly above water, and placed the seal on top of it, protecting it from the predators.This example \u2013 while being just straight-up weird \u2013 is also\n\nevidence that humpbacks know exactly what they're doing when they rescue these creatures,\n\nsays Pitman, who made the observation.Now researchers are wondering where this behaviour stems from. After all, it's not like humpbacks really gain anything by being the good guys of the sea.\"More often, though, humpbacks approached MEKWs (mammal-eating killer whales) that were attacking prey species that were clearly not humpbacks (e.g. a grey whale calf with its mother, a seal hauled out on an ice floe, a sunfish), and although the humpbacks faced little risk of serious injury, they also gained no obvious benefits for their time and energy spent,\"\n\nthe team writes in\n\nMarine Mammal Science",

Understanding the nature of such interactions will give us a greater understanding of how galaxies, and the universe, have evolved.\n\"For a long time, we've been looking into space to try and find a pair of these supermassive black holes orbiting as a result of two galaxies merging,\" says Greg Taylor, one of the researchers, from The University of New Mexico (UNM).\"Even though we've theorised that this should be happening, nobody had ever seen it until now.\"The team observed the pair of black holes in a galaxy, named 0402+379, roughly 750 million light years from Earth.VLBA map of radio galaxy 0402+379 at 15 GHz. Credit: UNMAccording to\n\nKarishma\n\nBansal, the first author on the paper, also from UNM, the combined mass of these supermassive black holes is about 15 billion times that of our sun, and their orbital period is around 24,000 years.\nThis means that even though the team has been observing these black holes for over a decade, they haven't been able to detect even the slightest curvature in their orbit.\"If you imagine a snail on the recently-discovered Earth-like planet orbiting Proxima Centauri - 4.243 light years away - moving at 1cm [0.4 inches] a second, that's the angular motion we're resolving here,\" explains Roger W. Romani, one of the researchers from Stanford University.Black holes are notoriously difficult to study because they cannot be directly observed, but can only be detected from their effect on nearby matter.So, to find the orbit of these black holes, the UNM team used the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), which is composed of 10 radio telescopes. By measuring the various frequencies of radio signals emitted by the black holes, the team was then able to plot their trajectory.\n\"When Dr. Taylor gave me this data I was at the very beginning of learning how to image and understand it,\" says Bansal.\"And, as I learned there was data going back to 2003, we plotted it and determined they are orbiting one another.

We'd like to see those things come together a little bit,\" Treuer told Scientific American.\"That's not licence for any agricultural company to just start dumping their waste products on protected areas, but it does mean that [we] should start thinking about ways to do thoughtful experimentation to see if in their particular system they can have similar win-win-win results.\"The findings are reported in Restoration Ecology",

The study, published in a leading scientific journal, highlights the potential of lower-cost restoration methods that could significantly scale up tropical forest restoration efforts, offering a range of societal and ecosystem benefits.\n\nThe research team, as part of an innovative agricultural waste disposal service contract in 1998, applied an estimated 12,000 Mg of processed orange peels and pulp to a 3 ha portion of a former cattle pasture with degraded soils due to fire-based land management and overgrazing. Over a span of 16 years, the experimental plot exhibited impressive outcomes compared to an adjacent control plot.\n\nThe findings revealed a threefold increase in woody plant species richness, a tripling of tree species evenness, and a remarkable 176% boost in aboveground woody biomass in the area where orange waste was applied. Hemispheric photography further confirmed a significant increase in canopy closure in the treated area, indicating enhanced forest growth and density.\n\nMoreover, soil analysis conducted 2 and 16 years post-application showed elevated levels of essential macronutrients and micronutrients in the soil, underscoring the positive impact of orange waste deposition on soil fertility and health. These results suggest promising opportunities for synergies between agricultural waste disposal, tropical forest restoration, and carbon sequestration.\n\nThe study's lead author emphasized the importance of exploring innovative and sustainable approaches to tropical forest restoration, particularly in regions facing challenges such as degraded soils and deforestation.

        "a": "Life is a series of addictions and without them we die.\"\n\nThis is my favourite quote in academic addiction literature and was made back in 1990 in the British Journal of Addiction, by Isaac Marks.\nThis deliberately provocative and controversial statement was made to stimulate debate about whether excessive and potentially problematic activities such as gambling, sex and work really can be classed as genuine addictions.Many of us might say to ourselves that we are 'addicted'\n\nto tea, coffee, work or chocolate, or know others who we might describe as being 'hooked'\n\non television or using pornography. But do these assumptions have any basis in fact?The issue all comes down to how addiction is defined in the first place \u2013 as many of us in the field disagree on what the core components of addiction actually are. Many would argue that the words \"addiction\" and \"addictive\" are used so much in everyday circumstances that they have become meaningless.For instance, saying that a book is an \"addictive read\" or that a specific television series is \"addictive viewing\" renders the word useless in a clinical setting. Here, the word \"addictive\" is arguably used in a positive way and as such it devalues its real meaning.\nHealthy enthusiasm \u2026 or real problem?The question I get asked most \u2013 particularly by the broadcast media \u2013 is what is the difference between a healthy excessive enthusiasm and an addiction?My response is simple: a healthy excessive enthusiasm adds to life, whereas an addiction takes away from it.I also believe that to be classed as an addiction, any such behaviour should comprise a number of key components, including overriding preoccupation with the behaviour, conflict with other activities and relationships, withdrawal symptoms when unable to engage in the activity, an increase in the behaviour over time (tolerance), and use of the behaviour to alter mood state.Other consequences, such as feeling out of control with the behaviour and cravings for the behaviour are often present.If all these signs and symptoms are present then I would call the behaviour a true addiction. But that hasn't stopped others accusing me of watering down the concept of addiction.\nThe science of addictionA few years ago, Steve Sussman, Nadra Lisha and I published a review examining the relationship between 11 potentially addictive behaviours reported in the academic literature: smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, taking illicit drugs, eating, gambling, internet use, love, sex, exercise, work and shopping.We examined the data from 83 large-scale studies and reported a prevalence of an addiction among US adults ranged from as low as 15 percent to as high as 61 percent in a 12-month period.We also reported it plausible that 47 percent of the US adult population suffers from maladaptive signs of an addictive disorder over a 12-month period and that it may be useful to think of addictions as due to problems of lifestyle as well as to person-level factors.In short \u2013 and with many caveats \u2013 our paper argued that at any one time almost half the US population is addicted to one or more behaviours.\nThere is a lot of scientific literature showing that having one addiction increases the propensity to have other addictions.For instance, in my own research, I have come across alcoholic pathological gamblers \u2013 and we can all probably think of people we might describe as caffeine-addicted workaholics.It is also common for people who give up one addiction to replace it with another (which we psychologists call \"reciprocity\").This is easily understandable as when a person gives up one addiction it leaves a void in the person's life and often the only activities that can fill the void and give similar experiences are other potentially addictive behaviours.This has led many people to describe such people as having an \"addictive personality\".Addictive personalities?While there are many pre-disposing factors for addictive behaviour, including genes and personality traits, such as high neuroticism (anxious, unhappy, prone to negative emotions) and low conscientiousness (impulsive, careless, disorganised), addictive personality is a myt",
        "b": "Title: Study Suggests Common Components in Behavioral Addictions\n\nIn a recent scientific paper, researchers have highlighted a growing movement that considers various behaviors as potentially addictive, even those that do not involve the consumption of drugs. The study argues that addictions, whether they involve substances like drugs or activities like gambling, sex, exercise, video game playing, and internet use, share common components.\n\nThe paper identifies six key components that are present in all types of addictions: salience (when the behavior becomes the most important thing in a person's life), mood modification (using the behavior to change one's emotional state), tolerance (needing more of the behavior to achieve the same effect), withdrawal (experiencing negative emotions when the behavior is stopped), conflict (experiencing conflicts with others or within oneself due to the behavior), and relapse (returning to the behavior after attempting to stop).\n\nThe researchers argue that addictions are part of a complex biopsychosocial process, and there is increasing evidence that excessive behaviors of various kinds share many similarities. This suggests that an eclectic approach to studying addictive behavior may be the most effective way to advance the field.\n\nThe findings of this study have implications not only for the treatment of addictive behaviors but also for how the general public perceives such behaviors. By recognizing the commonalities among different types of addictions, researchers and healthcare professionals may be better equipped to develop more effective interventions and support systems for individuals struggling with various forms of addiction.\n\nOverall, this research sheds light on the interconnected nature of addictive behaviors and emphasizes the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing these complex issues.",

Scientists have come up with a new chip fabrication approach that they say could lead to much thinner and flexible computer chips in the future.\nDeveloped by a team at MIT, it's the\n\nfirst chip fabrication technique where significantly different materials are deposited in the same layer. Today's computer chips, in contrast, are built from (very thin) layers stacked on top of one another, with precise patterns etched into them. The researchers say they've refined the process far enough to be able to build chips containing \"all the circuit components necessary to produce a general-purpose computer\".\"The methodology is universal for many kinds of structures,\" says Xi Ling, one of the authors of the paper. \"This offers us tremendous potential with numerous candidate materials for ultra-thin circuit design.\"The layers of material are just 1-3 atoms thick, and they chose graphene as one of the materials used - the 'wonder material' has already been used in a variety of different innovations and experiments, and its thinness and strength makes it perfect for use in thin-film electronics.In fact, the new process can mix any material that combines elements from group 6 of the periodic table (including chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten) and elements from group 16 (including sulphur, selenium, and tellurium). As many of these compounds are semiconductors - which form the basis of transistor design - they can prove very useful in extremely thin layers of electronics.\nIn the tests run by the MIT team, a layer of graphene is deposited on a silicon substrate, with gaps etched in for the second material to fill. This second material, molybdenum disulphide, is applied using a solid bar of material known as a PTAS. As the PTAS passes over the chip, its molecules cause a reaction with the exposed silicon, and a layer of molybdenum disulphide is formed. The same process can be used to combine several different materials in the same way.While the science is tricky to wrap your head around, the eventual applications are simple: thinner, more flexible electronics that take new shapes, set new levels of portability, or attach themselves to other objects as a layer of film. The next step is to use the technology to try and create tunnelling-transistor processors, which use a quantum mechanical effect to block a charge or allow it through.The work has been published in the journal Advanced Materials.*Image above: The researchers used the MIT and Tim the Beaver logos to show photoluminescence emissions from a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide inlayed onto graphene.

This achievement was made possible through the selective \"sowing\" of aromatic molecules as seeds in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, enabling the large-scale fabrication of lateral heterostructures with immense potential for applications in integrated circuits.\n\nAs the semiconductor industry approaches the fundamental limit of Moore's law, which governs the scaling of electronic devices, there is a growing need for alternative technologies beyond conventional CMOS electronics. The emergence of atomically thin and ultra-flexible two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), presents a promising solution to push the boundaries of semiconductor technology further and potentially surpass the limitations imposed by Moore's law.\n\nHybrid structures formed by stacking different 2D materials offer enhanced functionality and broader capabilities for nanoscale modern electronics and optoelectronics. While vertical stacking of van der Waals heterostructures can be achieved through mechanical transfer or hetero-epitaxy, the horizontal stitching of 2D materials has proven to be more challenging due to the lack of a selective etching method for each specific material.\n\nResearchers have previously attempted to create lateral heterostructures between materials with similar lattice structures and small lattice mismatch, such as graphene-hBN and TMD-TMD configurations. However, achieving a parallel connection between two atomically thin layers with significant crystallographic differences, such as graphene-TMD or hBN-TMD heterostructures, had remained elusive until now.\n\nThe successful synthesis of diverse parallel stitched 2D heterostructures opens up new possibilities for the design and fabrication of advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. By overcoming the limitations of conventional nanofabrication techniques and enabling precise spatial control and self-limiting processes, this innovative approach promises to revolutionize the field of 2D materials research and pave the way for the development of next-generation integrated circuits.\n\nThis breakthrough not only represents a significant advancement in the field of materials science but also holds great promise for realizing a vision of ubiquitous electronics and optoelectronics in the near future. With the potential to surpass the constraints of Moore's law and drive innovation in semiconductor technology, the synthesis of diverse 2D heterostructures marks a critical step towards the creation of more efficient and powerful electronic devices.",

Over the past 10 years, researchers have been intensely investigating the various characteristics of this multi-purpose material - made from multiple stacks of 1-atom-thick carbon layers - and have only been able to explain its occasional magnetism though manufacturing defects or through the binding of certain chemical groups that give it this property.\nBut making graphene reliably electromagnetic - and therefore usefully electromagnetic - has proven difficult. Until now, because a team from the US Naval Research Laboratory have just figured out how to achieve what they're calling \"a simple and robust means to magnetise graphene\", over a large array of the material, and they do it using plain old hydrogen.\n\nThe technique, which they've outlined in the journal Advanced Materials, involves sitting some graphene on a silicon wafer, which they will submerge in a pool of cryogenic ammonia and lithium for about a minute. They then add hydrogen atoms to the mix, which renders the graphene electromagnetic. \"This method of hydrogenation gives us access to a much wider range of hydrogen coverage than previous methods allowed,\" one of the team, chemist Keith Whitener, said in a press release.\"I was surprised that the partially hydrogenated graphene prepared by our method was so uniform in its magnetism and apparently didn't have any magnetic grain boundaries,\"\n\nhis colleague, Paul Sheehan, added.The technique is also adjustable - you can turn the magnetic strength up and down using an electron beam that can shave off hydrogen atoms when there are too many in the mix. It does this by breaking the chemical bond between the graphene and the hydrogen, which renders the graphene no longer magnetic.

        "a": "potential sea level surface melt ponds One of the largest icebergs ever recorded has just broken away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Over the past few years I've led a team that has been studying this ice shelf and monitoring change.\nWe spent many weeks camped on the ice investigating melt ponds and their impact \u2013 and struggling to avoid sunburn thanks to the thin ozone layer. Our main approach, however, is to use satellites to keep an eye on things.We've been surprised by the level of interest in what may simply be a rare but natural occurrence. Because, despite the media and public fascination, the Larsen C rift and iceberg \"calving\" is not a warning of imminent sea level rise, and any link to climate change is far from straightforward.This event is, however, a spectacular episode in the recent history of Antarctica's ice shelves, involving forces beyond the human scale, in a place where few of us have been, and one which will fundamentally change the geography of this region.Adrian Luckman / MIDASIce shelves are found where glaciers meet the ocean and the climate is cold enough to sustain the ice as it goes afloat. Located mostly around Antarctica, these floating platforms of ice a few hundred meters thick form natural barriers which slow the flow of glaciers into the ocean and thereby regulate sea level rise.\nIn a warming world, ice shelves are of particular scientific interest because they are susceptible both to atmospheric warming from above and ocean warming from below.The ice shelves of the Antarctic peninsula. AJ Cook & DG Vaughan, 2014, CC BY-SABack in the 1890s, a Norwegian explorer named Carl Anton Larsen sailed south down the Antarctic Peninsula, a 1,000km long branch of the continent that points towards South America. Along the east coast he discovered the huge ice shelf which took his name.For the following century, the shelf, or what we now know to be a set of distinct shelves \u2013 Larsen A, B, C and D \u2013 remained fairly stable.However the sudden disintegrations of Larsen A and B in 1995 and 2002 respectively, and the ongoing speed-up of glaciers which fed them, focused scientific interest on their much larger neighbour, Larsen C, the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.\nThis is why colleagues and I set out in 2014 to study the role of surface melt on the stability of this ice shelf. Not long into the project, the discovery by our colleague, Daniela Jansen, of a rift growing rapidly through Larsen C, immediately gave us something equally significant to investigate.Nature at workThe development of rifts and the calving of icebergs is part of the natural cycle of an ice shelf. What makes this iceberg unusual is its size \u2013 at around 5,800 square kilometres (2,240 square miles) it's the size of a small US state.There is also the concern that what remains of Larsen C will be susceptible to the same fate as Larsen B, and collapse almost entirely.Our work has highlighted significant similarities between the previous behaviour of Larsen B and current developments at Larsen C, and we have shown that stability may be compromised. Others, however, are confident that Larsen C will remain stable.\nWhat is not disputed by scientists is that it will take many years to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C as it begins to adapt to its new shape, and as the iceberg gradually drifts away and breaks up. There will certainly be no imminent collapse, and unquestionably no direct effect on sea level because the iceberg is already afloat and displacing its own weight in seawater.Some great aerial footage from @BAS_News of the rift on Larsen C! pic.twitter.com/aXyCx9QTzX\u2014 Project MIDAS (@MIDASOnIce) February 21, 2017This means that, despite much speculation, we would have to look years into the future for ice from Larsen C to contribute significantly to sea level rise.In 1995 Larsen B underwent a similar calving event. However, it took a further seven years of gradual erosion of the ice-front before the ice shelf became unstable enough to collapse, and glaciers held back by it were able to speed up, and even then the collapse process may have depended on the presence of surface melt ponds.Updated #Sentinel1 InSAR sequence shows final branching at the rift tip as it reaches within 4.5 km (2.8 miles) of breaking through to calve pic.twitter.com/6F1Bs8Zmkv\u2014 Adrian Luckman (@adrian_luckman) July 6, 2017Even if the remaining part of Larsen C were to eventually collapse, many years into the future, the potential sea level rise is quite modest. Taking into account only the catchments of glaciers flowing into Larsen C, the total, even after decades, will probably be less than a centimetre.\nIs this a climate change signal?This event has also been widely but over-simplistically linked to climate change",

The study, which utilized interferometric synthetic-aperture radar data collected by ERS-1/2 and Radarsat-1 satellites, sheds light on the rapid changes occurring in the region following the collapse of the ice shelf.\n\nThe research team, led by scientists Hektoria Green and Evans, found that glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula experienced a dramatic increase in speed in the years following the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf. Specifically, the Hektoria and Evans glaciers accelerated eightfold between 2000 and 2003, before decelerating moderately in 2003. Similarly, the Jorum and Crane glaciers saw a twofold acceleration in early 2003, which further increased to threefold by the end of the same year.\n\nIn contrast, the Flask and Leppard glaciers located further south did not exhibit the same acceleration, as they are still supported by an ice shelf. The researchers noted that the mass loss associated with the accelerated flow of glaciers exceeded 27 km3 per year, with ice thinning at rates of tens of meters per year.\n\nThe study highlights the crucial role of ice shelves in maintaining the stability of glaciers and ice sheets. The abrupt evolution of the glaciers following the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf underscores the importance of buttressing ice shelves in regulating ice sheet mass balance and their contribution to sea level rise.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the dynamics of glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula and their response to environmental changes. As climate change continues to impact polar regions, further research will be essential to monitor and predict the future behavior of glaciers and ice shelves in Antarctica.",

        "a": "Title: New Study Challenges Primordial Soup Theory in Origin of Life Debate\n\nIn a groundbreaking new study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have challenged the long-standing concept of the primordial soup as the origin of life on Earth. The 81-year-old idea, which suggests that life began in a nutrient-rich, homogeneous mixture of chemicals, has been a central tenet in mainstream thinking on the origin of life. However, the study highlights significant thermodynamic and bioenergetic failings in this theory.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Smith from the University of Science, argues that the primordial soup lacks the necessary conditions for energy coupling by chemiosmosis, a process essential for carbon and energy metabolism in all free-living organisms. Chemiosmosis involves the generation of a proton gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP, the energy currency of cells.\n\nThe study proposes an alternative hypothesis, suggesting that the earliest cells may have harnessed a geochemically created proton-motive force at alkaline hydrothermal vents. These natural proton gradients, formed at the vents, are believed to have played a crucial role in the origin of life. The researchers speculate that early cells could have initially relied on these geochemical gradients before evolving the ability to generate their own proton-motive force.\n\nAccording to the study, the synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis likely involved the transfer of electrons from hydrogen as the donor to CO2 as the acceptor. This novel perspective challenges traditional views on the metabolic processes that may have driven the emergence of life on Earth.\n\nDr. Smith and his team's findings shed new light on the complex mechanisms that may have facilitated the transition from geochemical energy sources to cellular energy production in the early stages of life's evolution. The study opens up exciting avenues for further research into the origins of life and the fundamental processes that underpin cellular metabolism.\n\nAs scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of life's beginnings, this study serves as a reminder of the importance of questioning established theories and exploring alternative hypotheses in the quest to understand the origins of life on our planet.",
        "b": "For nearly nine decades, science's favourite explanation for the origin of life has been the 'primordial soup'. This is the idea that life began from a series of chemical reactions in a warm pond on Earth's surface, triggered by an external energy source such as lightning strike or ultraviolet (UV) light.\nBut recent research adds weight to an alternative idea, that life arose deep in the ocean within warm, rocky structures called hydrothermal vents.A study published last month in Nature Microbiology suggests the last common ancestor of all living cells fed on hydrogen gas in a hot iron-rich environment, much like that within the vents.\n\nAdvocates of the conventional hypothesis\n\nhave been sceptical that these findings should change our view of the origins of life.But the hydrothermal vent hypothesis, which is often described as exotic and controversial, explains how living cells evolved the ability to obtain energy, in a way that just wouldn't have been possible in a primordial soup.Under the conventional hypothesis, life supposedly began when lightning or UV rays caused simple molecules to join together into more complex compounds.\n\nThis culminated in the creation of information-storing molecules similar to our own DNA, housed within the protective bubbles of primitive cells.\nLaboratory experiments confirm that trace amounts of molecular building blocks that make up proteins and information-storing molecules can indeed be created under these conditions. For many, the primordial soup has become the most plausible environment for the origin of first living cells.But life isn't just about replicating information stored within DNA. All living things have to reproduce in order to survive, but replicating the DNA, assembling new proteins and building cells from scratch require tremendous amounts of energy.At the core of life are the mechanisms of obtaining energy from the environment, storing and continuously channelling it into cells' key metabolic reactions.Where this energy comes from and how it gets there can tell us a whole lot about the universal principles governing life's evolution and origin. Recent studies increasingly suggest that the primordial soup was not the right kind of environment to drive the energetics of the first living cells.\nIt's classic textbook knowledge that all life on Earth is powered by energy supplied by the sun and captured by plants, or extracted from simple compounds such as hydrogen or methane. Far less known is the fact that all life harnesses this energy in the same and quite peculiar way.This process works a bit like a hydroelectric dam. Instead of directly powering their core metabolic reactions, cells use energy from food to pump protons (positively charged hydrogen atoms) into a reservoir behind a biological membrane. This creates what is known as a 'concentration gradient' with a higher concentration of protons on one side of the membrane than other.The protons then flow back through molecular turbines embedded within the membrane, like water flowing through a dam. This generates high-energy compounds that are then used to power the rest of cell's activities.Life could have evolved to exploit any of the countless energy sources available on Earth, from heat or electrical discharges to naturally radioactive ores. Instead, all life forms are driven by proton concentration differences across cells' membranes.\nThis suggests that the earliest living cells harvested energy in a similar way and that life itself arose in an environment in which proton gradients were the most accessible power source.Vent hypothesisRecent studies based on sets of genes that were likely to have been present within the first living cells trace the origin of life back to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. These are porous geological structures produced by chemical reactions between solid rock and water.Alkaline fluids from the Earth's crust flow up the vent towards the more acidic ocean water, creating natural proton concentration differences remarkably similar to those powering all living cells.The studies suggest that in the earliest stages of life's evolution, chemical reactions in primitive cells were likely driven by these non-biological proton gradients. Cells then later learned how to produce their own gradients and escaped the vents to colonise the rest of the ocean and eventually the planet",

        "a": "The immense popularity of the bright, energy-saving electrical components called light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has been a boon for the environment. But researchers are also discovering it has come at a rather serious cost.\nThanks partially to solid-state lighting's bigger bang for your buck, the growing problem of light pollution is showing no sign of slowing, which is bad news for our ecosystems and our health.A big part of the problem is we just don't think of light in the same way we do noxious aerosols or toxic fluids.So when we invent new light-emitting technology, we're less likely to think of the potential cost to the environment\n\n\u2013 we think of what annoying shadows we can blast away with a few extra bulbs.The result is as clear as daylight \u2013 our world has less darkness than ever before.Physicist Chris Kyba from the German Research Centre for Geosciences has led a study using satellite data to investigate how brighter our nights are becoming.And while he doesn't point the finger solely at LEDs, they do represent the problem.\n\"We'll light something that we didn't light before, like a bicycle path through a park or a section of highway leading outside of town that in the past wasn't lit,\" says Kyba.The researchers use the term 'rebound effect' to describe how a savings in energy leaves us with more money that we simply pour back into the product.We can see the same effect in our approach to buying cars \u2013 better fuel efficiency leads to more fuel to drive longer distances, rather than a reduction in overall power consumption.Light pollution isn't a new concern, especially among astronomers, ecologists, and insomniacs.Outdoor illumination grew at a rate of about 3 to 6 percent per year\n\nin the second half of the 20th century, seeing an end to night as we knew it in many parts of the world. And we've needed to rely on statistical estimates and assumptions to get a grip on how bad it is.\nSufficiently calibrated satellite technology has only recently provided data that's accurate and reliable enough to monitor the problem in detail.The team used information gathered by a radiometer called the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which was mounted on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite named Suomi NPP.Restricting themselves to data collected in October in order to avoid added illumination from holiday period festivities, the researchers analysed the growth in light pollution between 2012 and 2016.On average the amount of area illuminated at night increased by about 2.2 percent each year. Continuously lit areas were also about 2.2 percent brighter each year.Growth mostly occurred throughout South America, Africa, and Asia, while declines in lighting were noticed mostly in war-torn zones, such as Syria and Yemen. Illumination had stabilised in just a few countries, mostly those which were already brilliantly lit.\nIf this all sounds serious, the reality is likely to be slightly worse.\n\nThe satellite data couldn't directly detect the bluer wavelengths emitted by many LEDs.\"We can say with fairly high confidence even though we didn't measure in the satellite an increase in these countries, they are nearly certainly increasing in brightness in terms of how human beings would perceive the light,\" says Kyba.This end of the visible light spectrum more closely resembles daylight, so even if we were to assume the overall luminosity didn't increase in countries that were replacing old bulbs with LED technology, we'd still perceive night to feel more like day.It's well established that this flood of blue light has a serious impact on our health and wellbeing.It also messes with wildlife \u2013 you might not care much about a few moths getting dazed by the lights, but research shows LED lighting could have profound impacts on a range of plant and animal species.\nManipulating their spectrum and intensity according to certain times of the day could offer a small amount of respite, but there's a lot to be said for simply asking if we really need so much light.By 2020, LED lights are set to account for 61 percent of the global lighting market. That's a good thing where power consumption is concerned.It should also be a reminder to remember there's another kind of pollution we need to be concerned about when it comes to switching off that light.\n\nThis research was published in Science Advance",
        "b": "Title: Study Shows Environmental Impact of White LEDs on Insect Populations\n\nIn recent years, white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become a popular choice for outdoor lighting due to their energy efficiency and longevity. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact of LEDs on the environment and human health. A new study conducted by researchers sheds light on the ecological consequences of using white LEDs in outdoor settings.\n\nThe study, which spanned three years, simulated different lighting strategies in a grassland ecosystem that had not been previously exposed to artificial light. The researchers tested the effects of dimming LEDs by 50%, manipulating their spectra to reduce ecologically damaging wavelengths, and switching off lights during periods of low demand.\n\nThe results of the experiment were striking. White LEDs were found to increase the total abundance of adult spiders and beetles in the ecosystem, as well as alter the composition of these insect populations. Dimming the LEDs by 50% or manipulating their spectra helped reduce the impact on some species, but the abundances of two common species were still affected.\n\nThe study suggests that while management strategies such as dimming and spectral manipulation can mitigate the ecological impacts of LEDs to some extent, completely avoiding the use of artificial lighting may be necessary to fully protect biodiversity. The researchers emphasize that the environmental consequences of using alternative lighting technologies need to be carefully considered.\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of understanding the effects of artificial lighting on ecosystems and the need for sustainable lighting practices. As white LEDs continue to replace traditional outdoor lighting technologies worldwide, it is crucial to balance the benefits of energy efficiency with the potential harm to wildlife and the environment. Further research and policy measures may be needed to minimize the ecological footprint of outdoor lighting.",

        "a": "World Kindness Day is a global 24-hour celebration dedicated to paying-it-forward and focusing on the good. We are encouraged to perform acts of kindness such as giving blood, cleaning a communal microwave at work, or volunteering at a nursing home.\nOf course, even without the encouragement of an international awareness day, kindness and selflessness are widespread among both humans and animals. Many people donate to charity and feel significantly happier as a direct result of doing so.In the animal kingdom, many species show kindness by refraining from violence when settling conflicts. Instead they may use comparatively harmless fighting conventions.Typical examples include male fiddler crabs fighting over a burrow but never crushing each other's bodies with their huge pincers, rattlesnakes wrestling without ever biting each other or Bonobos helping strangers even without being asked. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">The benefits gained from receiving kindness are intuitively obvious. But the motivations for engaging in kindness are much less so. In fact, the very existence of kindness and altruism seems to contradict Darwin's theory of evolution, based as it is on a competitive process of natural selection in which only the fittest survive.\nFor example, the selfless behaviour of sterile ants, who protect their colonies from dangerous predators, poses a problem that Darwin himself at first considered \"insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory\".So how could kind behaviour have evolved \u2013 and why was it not eliminated by natural selection? Many theorists have grappled with this problem over the years. We review the most prominent ideas below.Explaining kindnessEarly approaches, from the time of Darwin up to the 1960s, tried to explain the evolution of kindness by hypothesising that individuals behave cooperatively for the good of their group or species, irrespective of personal costs.This theory \u2013 \"group selection theory\" \u2013 was the only explanation for many decades, but it is now regarded with scepticism. How could cooperative populations, which allegedly survived better than competitive populations, have evolved in the first place?\nPart of the answer is provided by the more recent selfish gene theory, widely known through Richard Dawkins's bestselling book, or \"inclusive fitness\", according to which natural selection favours kindness to our close relatives, who look similar to us and share our genes.Helping a relative is a way of passing on copies of our own genes, and it benefits the helper in proportion to how related he or she is to the recipient.But this does not explain kindness towards people with no shared genes. So in the case of unrelated individuals, another theory has been put forward. The theory of reciprocal altruism includes the idea of \"I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine\", which can be a win-win strategy.If two unrelated individuals take turns in being kind, they thereby establish a relationship of repeated cooperation benefiting both",

The study, which focused on the Centipede game as a model of reciprocal cooperation, found that human decision-makers exhibit a strong tendency towards cooperation under various conditions.\n\nThe Centipede game is a formal model that illustrates alternating reciprocal cooperation, where players take turns making decisions that can either benefit or harm the other player. According to traditional backward induction arguments in game theory, it was believed that instrumentally rational players would never cooperate in this manner. However, the results of the systematic review of experimental research conducted by the researchers paint a different picture.\n\nThe study revealed that human decision-makers cooperate frequently in the Centipede game, with cooperation being the norm except under extreme conditions. The researchers investigated various factors that influence cooperation, including aspects of the payoff function, the number of players involved, repetitions of the game, group versus individual decisions, and players' social value orientations (SVOs).\n\nAmong these factors, the researchers found that other-regarding preferences, such as prosocial behavioral dispositions and collective rationality, played a significant role in explaining cooperation. The social gain from cooperation and the risk associated with cooperative moves were identified as influential aspects of the payoff function that motivated players to cooperate.\n\nThe findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of human behavior in social interactions. By challenging the traditional assumptions of game theory and highlighting the prevalence of cooperation among humans, the study sheds new light on the complexities of social decision-making processes.\n\nAs researchers continue to explore the dynamics of cooperation in social interactions, the study paves the way for future investigations into the underlying mechanisms that drive human behavior and shape our social relationships. The results of this study not only expand our knowledge of human cooperation but also offer valuable insights for fields such as economics, psychology, and sociology.",

The study presents the concept of artificially motorized sperm cells, a novel hybrid micromotor system designed to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies in carrying out their natural function.\n\nThe innovative approach involves utilizing customized microhelices as motors to transport sperm cells that may have impaired motility. The researchers found that metal-coated polymer microhelices are particularly effective in providing potent, controllable, and nonharmful 3D motion behavior, making them suitable for this task.\n\nThrough a series of experiments, the scientists were able to capture, transport, and release single immotile live sperm cells in fluidic channels that mimic physiological conditions. By employing proper methods of sperm selection and oocyte culturing, the researchers addressed important steps toward fertilization using the artificially motorized sperm cells.\n\nWhile there are still challenges to overcome in achieving successful fertilization with these artificially motorized sperm cells, the researchers are optimistic about the potential of this novel approach in assisted reproduction. The study marks a significant advancement in the field of reproductive technology and opens up new possibilities for individuals struggling with infertility.\n\nThe development of artificially motorized sperm cells represents a promising avenue for improving the success rates of assisted reproduction procedures.

Once the sperm has reached its target and become embedded in the egg, the metal casing can reverse direction to detach itself.While still at an early stage, the new spermbots could theoretically provide a more effective and less expensive alternative to artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation (where the egg is removed from the body before being fertilised) for couples.

And when they bathe, their stress hormone levels drop.To figure this out, Rafaela Takeshita and colleagues from Kyoto University picked a troop with 12 adult female macaques.The monkeys are the non-human primates who live the furthest north in the entire world.They do grow longer and thicker fur in the winter, but at least some also indulge in baths at hot springs in the park.The first time researchers spotted this behaviour was in 1963, when a young female was spotted in a spring at a hotel.Observations revealed that other monkeys did the same, though they stopped bathing as the weather warmed up by the end of March, indicating they primarily did this to stay warm.\nThe park decided it'd be more hygienic for the monkeys to have their own hot spring than to share one with humans, so they built one just for the macaques.By 2003, they'd observed that 31 percent of females regularly made use of the hot water.But cold isn't just uncomfortable. Humans release stress hormones when exposed to cold temperatures; monkeys do the same.Since hot baths have have been shown to help lower stress hormone levels in humans, Takeshita and co-authors thought the same might be the case for the macaques.Studying snow monkeysThe scientists tracked the monkeys throughout a winter and spring, regularly collecting their faeces to measure hormone levels.They observed that in general, the dominant females got more access to the hot springs, indicating that they treat the baths as a limited resource.\nGenerally, those females had higher levels of stress hormones, associated with greater aggression. (Over time the researchers also observed that stress levels for these monkeys were unaffected by visits from tourists.)But during the times that the macaques would bathe, especially in winter and when it got cold outside, stress hormone levels would drop.\"This indicates that, as in humans, the hot spring has a stress-reducing effect in snow monkeys,\" Takeshita said in a news release.\"This unique habit of hot spring bathing by snow monkeys illustrates how behavioural flexibility can help counter cold-climate stress, with likely implications for reproduction and survival.\"Next time you're feeling stressed, take a cue from a macaque and try a hot soak.This article was originally published by Business Insider",

This behavior, which has been observed for decades and has even become a popular tourist attraction, has now been shown to play a crucial role in helping these primates counter cold-climate stress, with implications for reproduction and survival.\n\nJapanese macaques are the most northerly species of nonhuman primates in the world and have adapted to extremely cold winters. The researchers believed that the macaques at the Jigokudani Monkey Park in Nagano maintain their normal body temperature during winter due to their thicker and longer fur. Additionally, these snow monkeys are the only group of monkeys known to take hot spring baths, a behavior that was first observed in 1963 and has since been adopted by other monkeys in the group.\n\nThe study focused on twelve adult female snow monkeys during the spring birth season and winter mating season. The researchers monitored the time spent by the monkeys in the hot springs and collected fecal samples to analyze the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are influenced by thermoregulatory stress and body temperature management.\n\nThe results of the study confirmed that female snow monkeys use the hot springs more often in winter, especially during colder weeks. Dominant females, who spent more time bathing, also experienced higher energy expenditure due to their involvement in aggressive conflicts. However, taking a spa bath reduced stress hormone levels in these females, indicating that the hot spring baths have a positive impact on their well-being.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of behavioral flexibility in helping snow monkeys cope with cold-climate stress and suggests that the hot spring baths play a crucial role in conserving energy by reducing heat loss and lowering stress levels. These findings provide valuable insights into the adaptive strategies of Japanese macaques and have implications for their reproductive success and overall survival.\n\nThe research not only sheds light on the fascinating behavior of snow monkeys but also underscores the importance of understanding how animals adapt to their environments to ensure their well-being and conservation. The study opens up new avenues for further research on the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that enable animals to thrive in challenging environments.",

        "a": "Title: Regional Nuclear War Between India and Pakistan Could Lead to Global Food Crisis, Study Finds\n\nA recent scientific study has revealed that a regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan could have far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate conflict zone, impacting global food production and potentially putting a billion people at risk of famine. The study, conducted by researchers using a crop simulation model forced by global climate model simulations, focused on the potential impacts on agricultural production in China, the largest grain producer in the world.\n\nAccording to the study, a regional nuclear war could lead to a significant decrease in global surface temperature by 1\u00b0C\u20132\u00b0C for 5\u201310 years, affecting precipitation and solar radiation reaching Earth's surface. In the first year following the nuclear war event, the researchers found that China's agricultural production would be severely impacted, with annual rice production projected to decrease by 29%, maize production by 20%, and wheat production by 53%.\n\nThe study also explored the effects of different agricultural management practices, such as no irrigation, auto irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer application, and delayed planting dates, on crop production in the years following the nuclear war. The results showed that even with these management strategies in place, national crop production in China could still decrease by 16%\u201326% for rice, 9%\u201320% for maize, and 32%\u201343% for wheat over a 5-year period.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers warned that the reduction in food availability in China could have global implications, potentially leading to a global food crisis. The study suggested that a nuclear war using only a fraction of the current global nuclear arsenal could result in a prolonged decrease in food production, impacting major grain-producing regions worldwide and putting a billion people at risk of famine.\n\nThe findings of this study highlight the urgent need for international cooperation to prevent nuclear conflicts and mitigate the potential consequences of such events on global food security.

        "b": "President Donald Trump's vow to hit North Korea with 'fire and fury like the world has never seen' is an unveiled threat to unleash America's most potent weapons of mass destruction onto the Korean peninsula.\nAccording to many defence analysts, the risk of nuclear confrontation over Europe and the Indian subcontinent has also increased in recent years.In a more hopeful turn of events, 122 countries voted in June to adopt the United Nations Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in New York. The \"ban treaty\" will make nuclear weapons illegal for ratifying countries, and many see it as an opportunity to kick start a renewed effort towards multilateral disarmament.Supporters of the treaty argue that even a limited, regional nuclear war would produce a catastrophic and global humanitarian crisis.\n\nEqually, other analysts suggest that the reality is not as severe as is often depicted.In March this year, Matthias Eken, a researcher of attitudes towards nuclear weapons, wrote in The Conversation that their destructive power \"has been vastly exaggerated\" and that one should avoid overusing \"doomsday scenarios and apocalyptic language\".\nEken argued that nuclear weapons are not as powerful as often described, on the basis that a 9 megaton thermonuclear warhead dropped over the state of Arkansas would only destroy 0.2 percent of the state's surface area.He also observed that more than 2,000 nuclear detonations have been made on the planet without having ended human civilisation, and argued that if we want to mitigate the risk posed by nuclear weapons, we must not exaggerate those risks.Eken's sanguine approach towards nuclear weapons stands in contrast to the more dramatic rhetoric of global humanitarian catastrophe and existential threats to humanity. So what is the basis for the latter?Nuclear war is also a war on the environmentThe greatest concern derives from relatively new research which has modelled the indirect effects of nuclear detonations on the environment and climate. The most-studied scenario is a limited regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan, involving 100 Hiroshima-sized warheads (small by modern standards) detonated mostly over urban areas.\nMany analysts suggest that this is a plausible scenario in the event of an all-out war between the two states, whose combined arsenals amount to more than 220 nuclear warheads.In this event, an estimated 20m people could die within a week from the direct effects of the explosions, fire, and local radiation. That alone is catastrophic \u2013 more deaths than in the entire of World War I.But nuclear explosions are also extremely likely to ignite fires over a large area, which coalesce and inject large volumes of soot and debris into the stratosphere.In the India-Pakistan scenario, up to 6.5m tonnes of soot could be thrown up into the upper atmosphere, blocking out the sun and causing a significant drop in average surface temperature and precipitation across the globe, with effects that could last for more than a decade.\nThis ecological disruption would, in turn, badly affect global food production.According to one study, maize production in the US (the world's largest producer) would decline by an average by 12 percent over ten years in our given scenario.\n\nIn China, middle season rice would fall by 17 percent over a decade, maize by 16 percent, and winter wheat by 31 percent.With total world grain reserves amounting to less than 100 days of global consumption, such effects would place an estimated 2 billion people at risk of famine.Although a nuclear conflict involving North Korea and the US would be smaller, given Pyongyang's limited arsenal, many people would still die and ecological damage would severely affect global public health for years.Additionally, any nuclear conflict between the US and North Korea is likely to increase the risk of nuclear confrontation involving other states and other regions of the world",

        "a": "When it comes to texting, the period, full stop, point \u2013 whatever you call it \u2013 has been getting a lot of attention.People have begun noticing slight changes to the way our smallest punctuation mark is deployed, from declarations that it's going out of style to claims that it's becoming angry.\nWhat they're actually noticing is written language becoming more flexible, with texting possessing its own set of stylistic norms (sometimes informally called \"textspeak\" or \"textese\").The period is merely one example of this shift, a change that has opened up new possibilities for communicating with written language. Just as we have different styles of speaking in different situations, so do we have context-dependent styles of writing.Reading between the periodsThough periods can still signal the end of a sentence in a text message, many users will omit them (especially if the message is only one sentence long). This tendency now subtly influences how we interpret them.Because text messaging is a conversation that involves a lot of back-and-forth, people add fillers as a way to mimic spoken language. We see this with the increased use of ellipses, which can invite the recipient to continue the conversation.\nThe period is the opposite of that \u2013 a definitive stop that signals, as linguistics professor Mark Liberman has explained, \"This is final, this is the end of the discussion.\"For some, this can appear angry or standoffish.Earlier this year, psychologist Danielle Gunraj tested how people perceived one-sentence text messages that used a period at the end of the sentence. Participants thought these text messages were more insincere than those that didn't have a period.But when the researchers then tested the same messages in handwritten notes, they found that the use of a period didn't influence how the messages were perceived.In a 2007 study by linguists Naomi Baron and Rich Ling, multi-sentence text messages often had punctuation to indicate where the sentences stopped, but only 29 percent of these texts had punctuation at the very end of the message. The reason, Baron and Ling explain, is that \"the act of sending a message coincides with sentence-final punctuation\".\nSituational switchesBut of all the things to feel when seeing a period at the end of a text message \u2013 why\n\ninsincerity?The answer could have something to do with a term used by linguist John J. Gumperz: \"situational code-switching\",\n\nwhich is when we change how we talk depending on where we are, who we're talking to or how we're communicating.A common example is the way we talk in a job interview versus at a bar with friends. Typically, a speaker will use much more formal language in an interview than when hanging out with peers.If you talked to your friends the same way you talked during a job interview, it would probably give a stilted, distant feeling to the conversation.Scholars originally investigated situational code-switching in spoken language because spoken language was used in both casual and formal settings. In the past, written language was almost always tinged with a level of formality because it was associated with permanence in books and written documents.\nHowever, now that text messaging and social media have given their users an outlet for casual written language, differences between writing styles can be seen.The use of the period is one example of situational code-switching: When using one in a text message, it's perceived as overly formal. So when you end your text with a period, it can come across as insincere or awkward, just like using formal spoken language in a casual setting like a bar.A different form of sincerityAnother example of language change in casual written forms is the repetition of letters. Communication scholar Erika Darics has observed that the repetition of letters or punctuation marks adds intensity to messages (\"stopppp!!!\"). She writes that this creates \"a display of informality through using a relaxed writing style\".\nLinguist Deborah Tannen described a similar phenomenon, noting that repeated exclamation points in a message can convey a sincere tone, like in the following text message:\nJACKIE I AM SO SO SO SORRY! I thought you were behind us in the cab and then I saw you weren't!!!!! I feel soooooooo bad! Catch another cab and ill pay for it for youuuuu\nNote that this message does not contain a message-final period, since that may convey insincerity that would contradict the apology being presented. Instead, the sender uses the non-standard long vowels in \"soooooooo\"\n\nand \"youuuuu\"\n\nas well as five exclamation points at the end of one sentence.Compare this to a standardised version of the text message:\nJackie, I am so sorry. I thought you were behind us in the cab and then I saw you weren't. I feel so bad! Catch another cab and I'll pay for it for you.\nThis more formal version, according to the arguments made by Tannen and Darics, reads more like a work email sent to a colleague than one to a friend sincerely and fervently apologising for a transportation mishap.\nIt's a bit counterintuitive, but using formal language may undermine the sincerity of the apology; in order to convey the 'right' message, it's important to know the proper protocols. This may explain why some people's text messages seem stilted or awkward: they're used to writing with a formal style that doesn't translate to the casual medium.Will texting erode our writing skills?In the media, there's been a fair amount of debate about whether texting \u2013 or using overly casual language \u2013 can 'ruin' someone's writing ability. (Examples include the LA Times, the BBC, and The Daily Mail, to name a few.)However, past research into situational code-switching in spoken language has shown that a person's ability to code-switch can signal social competency, can affirm one's sense of identity or membership\n\nin a community and may be an indicator of high intellectual ability in children",

The study sheds light on how children's use of text messaging may impact their academic performance in language-related subjects.\n\nThe research consisted of two studies involving children aged 10 to 12 years old. In the first study, children were asked to provide information on their texting behavior, including the frequency of text messages sent per day. Additionally, they were tasked with translating a standard English sentence into a text message and vice versa. The study also assessed the children's verbal and non-verbal reasoning scores.\n\nThe results of the first study revealed that children who sent three or more text messages a day had lower standardized verbal and non-verbal reasoning scores compared to those who did not engage in texting. However, an interesting finding emerged when children were asked to write a text message using text abbreviations (textisms). Those who demonstrated a greater use of textisms tended to perform better on a measure of verbal reasoning ability, which is closely linked to English scores in Key Stage 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second study, researchers delved deeper into children's writing skills by examining their performance on writing measures. Children were asked to complete an English to text message translation exercise, and their spelling proficiency was assessed. Positive correlations were found between spelling ability and performance on the translation exercise. Group-based comparisons also indicated that children with higher writing scores tended to use more textisms, although the direction of this association was not entirely clear.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that children's knowledge of textisms is not necessarily linked to poor written language outcomes for children in the 10 to 12 age range. The study highlights the complex relationship between texting behavior, text abbreviations, and academic performance in language-related subjects. Further research in this area could provide valuable insights into how modern communication methods impact children's language development and academic success.",

        "a": "The Tropics are defined as the area of Earth where the Sun is directly overhead at least once a year - the zone between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.However, tropical climates occur within a larger area about 30 degrees either side of the Equator. Earth's dry subtropical zones lie adjacent to this broad region. It is here that we find the great warm deserts of the world.\nEarth's bulging waistlineEarth's tropical atmosphere is growing in all directions, leading one commentator to cleverly call this Earth's \"bulging waistline\".Since 1979, the planet's waistline been expanding poleward by 56 kilometres to 111 kilometres per decade in both hemispheres.Future climate projections suggest this expansion is likely to continue, driven largely by human activities \u2013 most notably emissions of greenhouse gases and black carbon, as well as warming in the lower atmosphere and the oceans.If the current rate continues, by 2100 the edge of the new dry subtropical zone would extend from roughly Sydney to Perth.As these dry subtropical zones shift, droughts will worsen and overall less rain will fall in most warm temperate regions.Poleward shifts in the average tracks of tropical and extratropical cyclones are already happening. This is likely to continue as the tropics expand further.\nAs extratropical cyclones move, they shift rain away from temperate regions that historically rely upon winter rainfalls for their agriculture and water security.Researchers have observed that, as climate zones change, animals and plants migrate to keep up. But as biodiversity and ecosystem services are threatened, species that can't adjust to rapidly changing conditions face extinction.In some biodiversity hotspots \u2013 such as the far southwest of Australia \u2013 there are no suitable land areas (only oceans) for ecosystems and species to move into to keep pace with warming and drying trends.We are already witnessing an expansion of pests and diseases into regions that were previously climatically unsuitable. This suggests that they will attempt to follow any future poleward shifts in climate zones.I recently drew attention to the anticipated impacts of an expanding tropics for Africa. So what might this might mean for Australia?IPCCAustralia is vulnerable\nAustralia's geographical location makes it highly vulnerable to an expanding tropics. About 60 percent of the continent lies north of 30\u00b0S.As the edge of the dry subtropical zone continues to creep south, more of southern Australia will be subject to its drying effects.Meanwhile, the fringes of the north of the continent may experience rainfall and temperature conditions that are more typical of our northern neighbours.The effects of the expanding tropics are already being felt in southern Australia in the form of declining winter rainfall. This is especially the case in the southwest and - to a lesser extent - the continental southeast.Future climate change projections for Australia include increasing air and ocean temperatures, rising sea levels, more hot days (over 35\u2103), declining rainfall in the southern continental areas, and more extreme fire weather events",
        "b": "Title: Study Warns of Alarming Expansion of Tropics Poleward Due to Anthropogenic Drivers\n\nA recent scientific study has revealed that the tropics are expanding poleward at a concerning rate, driven largely by human activities such as the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The expansion of the tropics is expected to have significant implications for societies, economies, and natural environments worldwide.\n\nThe study highlights that the poleward shift of the dry sub-tropical zone into densely populated regions that have traditionally enjoyed a more temperate climate is of particular concern. This shift is projected to bring about unprecedented thermal conditions for hundreds of millions of people, along with an increase in extreme weather events.\n\nAustralia, in particular, is identified as being highly vulnerable to the expanding tropics. The southern parts of the country are expected to be influenced by the dry sub-tropical zone, leading to reductions in winter rainfall, rising temperatures, and more hot days. While future rainfall trends for northern Australia remain uncertain, there is a projected increase in the number of hot days and extreme weather events.\n\nThe study also raises concerns about the lack of consideration for future climate change in northern Australia in the White Paper for the Development of Northern Australia (2015). The oversight of climate change impacts in the development policies and plans for the region questions the feasibility and affordability of the proposed projects outlined in the White Paper.\n\nThe findings of the study emphasize the urgent need for proactive measures to address the expanding tropics and their implications. Failure to consider the effects of climate change on regions like Australia could lead to significant environmental and economic challenges in the future. Researchers urge policymakers to prioritize climate adaptation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of the expanding tropics on societies, economies, and natural environments.",

        "a": "Title: Policy Measures Successfully Reduce Prevalence of Fluorosis Among Australian Children\n\nIn a recent study evaluating the effectiveness of policy measures in reducing the prevalence of fluorosis among Australian children, researchers found promising results indicating a significant decline in the occurrence of fluorosis across three successive birth cohorts.\n\nFluorosis, a condition caused by excessive fluoride intake during tooth development, was highly prevalent among Australian children in the early 1990s. To address this issue, policy measures were implemented to control fluoride exposure and reduce the prevalence of fluorosis.\n\nThe study, which focused on a random sample of South Australian children born between 1989 and 1994, assessed fluoride exposures through questionnaires and conducted dental examinations using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) Index to evaluate fluorosis levels. The data were reweighted to reflect the state's child population.\n\nResults showed that children in the later birth cohorts were more likely to use low-concentration fluoridated toothpaste and used smaller amounts of toothpaste when they started brushing their teeth. The fluorosis experience in this population was predominantly very mild to mild.\n\nImportantly, the study revealed a significant decline in the prevalence of fluorosis across the three successive birth cohorts. The prevalence of fluorosis, as defined by TF1+ and TF2+ case definitions, decreased from 34.7% to 22.1% and from 17.9% to 8.3%, respectively.\n\nRisk factors for fluorosis identified in the study included the use of standard-concentration fluoridated toothpaste, habits of eating or licking toothpaste, and exposure to fluoridated water.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the experience of fluorosis among the South Australian child population was mostly very mild to mild, and the decline in prevalence was primarily attributed to the reduction in fluoride exposure from fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nThese findings highlight the success of policy measures in reducing the prevalence of fluorosis among Australian children and emphasize the importance of carefully balancing fluoride exposure to protect against dental caries while minimizing the risk of fluorosis. Further research and continued monitoring will be essential to ensure the long-term effectiveness of these measures in promoting oral health among children.",
        "b": "Evidence gathered over 60 years about adding fluoride to drinking water has failed to convince some people this major public health initiative is not only safe but helps to prevent tooth decay.\nMyths about fluoridated water persist. These include fluoride isn't natural, adding it to our water supplies doesn't prevent tooth decay, and it causes conditions ranging from cancer to Down syndrome.The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is in the process of updating its evidence on the impact of fluoridated water on human health since it last issued a statement on the topic in 2007.Its draft findings and recommendations are clear cut:\nNHMRC strongly recommends community water fluoridation as a safe, effective and ethical way to help reduce tooth decay across the population.\nIt came to its conclusion after analysing the evidence and issuing a technical report for those wanting more detail.Here are four common myths the evidence says are wrong.1. Fluoride isn't natural\nFluoride is a naturally occurring substance found in rocks that leaches into groundwater; it's also found in surface water. The natural level of fluoride in the water varies depending on the type of water (groundwater or surface) and the type of rocks and minerals it's in contact with.Fluoride is found in all natural water supplies at some concentration. Ocean water contains fluoride at around 1 part per million, about the same as levels of fluoridated drinking water in Australia.There are many places in Australia where fluoride occurs naturally in the water supply at optimum levels to maintain good dental health. For example, both Portland and Port Fairy in Victoria have naturally occurring fluoride in their water at 0.7-1.0 parts per million.What is the Difference Between Natural Fluoride and the Kind That is Artificially Added to Our Water Supply? |... https://t.co/yK7azTPIsd\u2014 sunflowerdance (@paramofsunflowe) June 22, 2017The type of fluoride commonly found in many rocks and the source of the naturally occurring fluoride ion in water supplies is calcium fluoride.\nThe three main fluoride compounds generally used to fluoridate water are: sodium fluoride, hydrofluorosilicic acid (hexafluorosilicic acid) and sodium silicofluoride. All these fully mix (dissociate) in water, resulting in the availability of fluoride ions to prevent tooth decay.So regardless of the original compound source, the end result is the same \u2013 fluoride ions in the water.2. Fluoridated water doesn't workWhat doesn't work to improve oral health? Fluoridated water. What's the solution? More fluoridated water. http://t.co/NesFAAfLv8\u2014 fluoridefreeAUS (@FluorideFreeAus) January 30, 2014Evidence for water fluoridation dates back to US studies in the 1940s, where dental researchers noticed lower levels of tooth decay in areas with naturally occurring fluoride in the water supply.\nThis prompted a study involving the artificial fluoridation of water supplies to a large community, and comparing the tooth decay rates to a neighbouring community with no fluoride.The trial had to be discontinued after six years because the benefits to the children in the fluoridated community were so obvious it was deemed unethical to not provide the benefits to all the children, and so the control community water supply was also fluoridated.Since then, consistently we see lower levels of tooth decay associated with water fluoridation, and the most recent evidence, from Australia and overseas, supports this.The NHMRC review found children and teenagers who had lived in areas with water fluoridation had 26-44 percent fewer teeth or surfaces affected by decay, and adults had 27 percent less tooth decay.\nA number of factors are likely to influence the variation across populations and countries, including diet, access to dental care, and the amount of tap water people drink.3. Fluoridated water causes cancer and other health problemsDespite widespread belief in fluoride's safety, activists north of Boston push to eliminate it from water supplies http://t.co/gZxLVkL9BI\u2014 Scuba Happy (@scubahappy97459) February 8, 2015The NHMRC found, there was reliable evidence to suggest water fluoridation at current levels in Australia of 0.6-1.1 parts per million is not associated with: cancer, Down syndrome, cognitive problems, lowered intelligence, hip fracture, chronic kidney disease, kidney stones, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, low birth weight, premature death from any cause, musculoskeletal pain, osteoporosis, skeletal fluorosis (extra bone fluoride), thyroid problems, or other self-reported complaints.\nThis confirms previous statements from the NHMRC on the safety of water fluoridation, and statements from international bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the World Dental Federation, the Australian Dental Association and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Most studies that claim to show adverse health effects report on areas where there are high levels of fluoride occurring naturally in the water supply. This is often more than 2-10 parts per million or more, up to 10 times levels found in Australian water.These studies are also often not of the highest quality, for example with small sample sizes and not taking into account other factors that may affect adverse health outcomes.There is, however, evidence that fluoridated water is linked to both the amount and severity of dental fluorosis. This is caused by being exposed to excess fluoride (from any source) while the teeth are forming, affecting how the tooth enamel mineralises.Most dental fluorosis in Australia is very mild or mild, and does not affect the either the function or appearance of the teeth. When you can see it, there are fine white flecks or lines on the teeth. Moderate dental fluorosis is very uncommon, and tends to include brown patches on the tooth surface. Severe dental fluorosis is rare in Australia.4. Fluoridated water is not safe for infant formulaSome people are concerned about using fluoridated water to make up infant formula.Mothers\u2014please do not use tap water for your baby formula. It is not safe because of the fluoride in the water.\u2014 John James (@JohnJames1526) April 20, 2017However, all infant formula sold in Australia has very low levels of fluoride, below the threshold amount of 17 micrograms of fluoride/100 kilojules (before reconstitution), which would require a warning label.Therefore, making up infant formula with fluoridated tap water at levels found in Australian (0.6-1.1 parts per million) is safe, and does not pose a risk for dental fluorosis. Indeed, Australian research shows there is no association between infant formula use and dental fluorosis.A consistent messageAdding fluoride to tap water to prevent tooth decay is one of our greatest public health achievements, with evidence gathered over more than 60 years showing it works and is safe. This latest review, tailored to Australia, adds to that evidence.Matthew Hopcraft, Clinical Associate Professor, Melbourne Dental School, University of Melbourne.This article was originally published on The Conversation.

        "a": "A prototype vaccine, decades in the making, that could prevent type 1 diabetes in children is ready to start clinical trials in 2018.It's not a cure, and it won't eliminate the disease altogether, but the vaccine is expected to provide immunity against a virus that has been found to trigger the body's defences into attacking itself, potentially reducing the number of new diabetes cases each year.\nOver two decades of research led by the University of Tampere in Finland has already provided solid evidence linking a type of virus called coxsackievirus B1 with an autoimmune reaction that causes the body to destroy cells in its own pancreas.The type 1 form of diabetes \u2013 not to be confused with the more prevalent type 2 variety that tends to affect individuals later in life \u2013 is a decreased ability to produce the insulin used by the body's cells to absorb glucose out of the blood.This loss of insulin is the result of pancreatic tissue called beta cells being destroyed by the body's own immune system, often within the first few years of life.It's something of a mystery as to why the body identifies beta cells as foreign, though there could be a genetic link producing variations of human leukocyte markers, which act as the cell's 'ID tags'.\nNo doubt it's complex, and there are numerous ways this process can be triggered. One example established by virologist Heikki Hy\u00f6ty from the University of Tampere is an infection by a type of enterovirus.Enteroviruses are nasty pieces of work; you might be most familiar with polio, but they can also cause hand, foot and mouth disease, meningitis and myocarditis. There has been suspicion of a link between this group of pathogens and diabetes for a number of years, but it took time to nail down the prime suspects.In 2014, Hy\u00f6ty and his team used a pair of studies on Finnish children with type 1 diabetes to show that at least one of the six viruses in the B group of coxsackieviruses was associated with the condition.Enteroviruses are surprisingly common in newborns, with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finding that around a quarter of the 444 known enterovirus infections in the US in 2007 were caused by coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1).\nAnd for some of those children, it could have been the start of a life-long, incurable condition.\"One can estimate from the generated data that less than 5 percent of CVB1-infected children go on to develop type 1 diabetes,\" the researchers wrote in their 2014 study.That might not seem like a lot, but it does suggest each year hundreds of infants around the globe develop type 1 diabetes. If the other members of the CVB group also contribute to beta cell autoimmunity \u2013 which they might \u2013 the numbers could be higher.If all goes well, this newly developed vaccine could put a stop to that.\"Already now it is known that the vaccine is effective and safe on mice,\" says Hy\u00f6ty.\"The developing process has now taken a significant leap forward as the next phase is to study the vaccine in humans.\"\nPre-clinical trials are of course just the first step. The next phase will involve testing on healthy adult humans, just to map out any complications.As a bonus, the vaccine could help reduce other enterovirus infections.\"Additionally, the vaccine would protect from infections caused by enteroviruses such as the common cold, myocarditis, meningitis and ear infections,\" says Hy\u00f6ty.It could be another eight years before we see whether the vaccine does what it's supposed to do, so we shouldn't be expecting anything revolutionary too soon.Meanwhile, groups like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) are continuing to fund research into finding better ways to prevent and treat type 1 diabetes by improving technology that mimics the function of the pancreas or by identifying ways to regenerate insulin-producing cells.\nEarlier this year, researchers identified an immature cell in the pancreas which can potentially be encouraged to take up the job of lost mature beta cells.There will be no single cure, treatment, or prevention which will gives us a diabetes-free world.Between 20 and 40 million people worldwide live with type 1 diabetes. A vaccine like this might not end the disease, but if it works it's certainly going to be a big step forwar",
        "b": "Title: Study Finds Correlation Between Reduced Natural Selection and Rising Type 1 Diabetes Prevalence Worldwide\n\nA recent study conducted by researchers aimed to investigate the correlation between the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and reduced natural selection, as measured by the Biological State Index (Ibs). The findings, published in a scientific journal, shed light on the increasing prevalence of T1D globally and its potential link to factors such as life expectancy, obesity rates, urbanization, and economic indicators.\n\nThe study analyzed data from 118 countries, including country-specific estimates of T1D prevalence, life expectancy, obesity rates, urbanization rates, per capita sugar consumption, and gross domestic product (GDP). The researchers calculated Ibs and country-specific longevity increase for each country and then matched these data to T1D prevalence for their ecological study.\n\nThe results revealed a significant correlation between T1D prevalence and both Ibs and life expectancy at birth, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.713 and 0.722, respectively. Additionally, T1D prevalence was found to be associated with Ibs and newborn life expectancy independent of factors such as sugar consumption, GDP, urbanization, and obesity rates.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that T1D prevalence was not correlated with longevity increase measured as life expectancy at 50 years old. The researchers also observed an exponential correlation between T1D prevalence and both life expectancy at birth and Ibs globally.\n\nThe findings suggest that reduced natural selection, as indicated by Ibs, may be a contributing factor to the increasing prevalence of T1D worldwide. The researchers propose that studying T1D epidemiology in the total population could provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of the rising prevalence of the disease.\n\nOverall, this study highlights the importance of considering factors related to natural selection and population health when examining the epidemiology of T1D. Further research in this area could help improve our understanding of the factors driving the increasing prevalence of T1D and inform strategies for prevention and management of the disease.",

        "a": "A lot of people will have already made up their mind about whether humans need dairy in their diet and will be thinking that the answer is obviously \"yes\" or obviously \"no\". But nutrition is based on science not opinion \u2013 so, here's the latest research on the matter.\nMilk is an interesting foodstuff. The sugar in it is called lactose and lactose requires a chemical or enzyme called lactase to allow it to pass across the walls of the gut into the blood stream.When we are babies, we all produce plenty of the lactase enzyme which allows us to absorb our mother's milk.In populations where milk consumption has been historically low, such as Japan and China, most children will have stopped producing lactase soon after weaning and \u2013 producing almost entire populations that may be unable to absorb the lactose in milk \u2013 this we call \"lactose intolerance\".In populations where milk consumption has always been high, such as in Europe, most adults continue to produce lactase for their whole lives and can digest milk quite happily with only around 5 percent of the population being lactose intolerant.\nContinuing to produce lactase into adulthood is actually an inherited genetic variation which has become so common because being able to tolerate milk has a selective advantage.Milk is a useful source of protein, energy, calcium, phosphate, B vitamins and iodine, meaning that those with the mutation were generally healthier and produced more children than those who couldn't tolerate milk, and so the presence of the mutation increased.The symptoms of lactose intolerance include wind, bloating and diarrhoea so if you don't experience any of those after drinking milk or eating ice cream then you're fine.FermentingKefir 'grains' after straining.\n\nA. Kniesel/WikipediaThere is good evidence that milk has been part of the human diet in Northern Europe for more than 8,000 years which is when people there first moved from being nomadic to having a more structured way of life.\nBecause 8,000 years ago most people didn't tolerate milk well, they quickly realised that if the milk was fermented and became cheese or yogurt it could be better tolerated.This is because these processes encourage bacteria to use up most of the carbohydrate - the lactose - in the milk so people who didn't produce the lactase enzyme could still benefit from the nutrients in the milk.Today people with lactose intolerance can drink kefir, a fermented milk drink made with a yeast starter, which some suggest also has probiotic benefits for the gut as well as many other health benefits.So dairy has been pivotal to nutrition and important to the survival of many populations in the world and most Europeans and North Americans are well adapted to digest it.So if you have been told that humans aren't adapted to have dairy in their diet, that isn't correct. Similarly, it isn't true to say that dairy promotes inflammation or acidity.\nCalciumNutritional scientists and dietitians have often assumed that because milk is rich in calcium, it is therefore good for maintaining the calcium levels in our bones.However, a couple of recent big studies have brought this into question. A further systematic review of the evidence concluded that actually, it doesn't seem to matter how much calcium you get from your diet, your risk of fracturing your bones remains the same.That said, we have seen that in cultures, where dairy plays a very minimal part in the traditional diet such as in China and Japan, the incidence of hip fracture \u2013 a common outcome of poor bone mineral density \u2013 is 150 percent higher than that of white American or European populations.One thing to remember about these studies is that they are looking at calcium intake in adulthood. However, we know that the strength of our bones is actually determined by our diet as children and teenager",

The research, published in a recent scientific journal, highlights how the prevalence of adult-type hypolactasia can range from less than 5% to nearly 100% in different populations.\n\nThe study reveals that the lowest prevalence of adult-type hypolactasia is found in northwestern Europe around the North Sea, while the highest prevalence is observed in the Far East. The reason for this variation lies in the genetic determination of selective (primary) hypolactasia by an autosomal recessive single gene.\n\nResearchers suggest that thousands of years ago, all individuals likely had hypolactasia, similar to most mammals today. However, in cultures where milk consumption began after childhood, individuals with lactase persistence, the ability to digest lactose into adulthood, had a selective advantage. These individuals were healthier and had more offspring compared to those with hypolactasia, leading to an increase in the frequency of the lactase persistence gene over time.\n\nThe findings of the study support a culture historical hypothesis, indicating that the present prevalence of hypolactasia can be explained by the selective advantage of lactase persistence in populations where milk consumption continued into adulthood.\n\nThe research also reviews the evidence for the inheritance of adult-type hypolactasia and its occurrence in various countries and populations worldwide. By understanding the genetic basis for the varying prevalence of lactose intolerance, researchers hope to gain insights into the evolutionary history of lactase persistence and its impact on human health and nutrition.\n\nThis study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between genetics, culture, and dietary habits in shaping the prevalence of adult-type hypolactasia across diverse populations. Further research in this area could have implications for personalized nutrition and health interventions tailored to individuals based on their genetic predisposition to lactose intolerance.",

The things is, the saltiness and pore size inside those minerals shouldn't be conducive to the formation of gas hydrates - and that's been puzzling experts until now.Two researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have used a complex experimental electrical field setup to examine how water and clay interact, and how gas hydrates could start to form in those ocean sediments.Scientists polarised water molecules to examine interactions with clay. (KAIST)\"Through this research, we gained better insight into the origin of gas hydrates occurrence in clay-rich sedimentary deposits,\" says one of the researchers, Tae-Hyuk Kwon.\n\"In the near future, we will soon be able to commercially produce methane gas from natural gas hydrate deposits.\"The scientists found that the negatively charged surfaces of clay materials were crucial in causing this flammable ice to form. The energy seems to partially break the hydrogen-bonded water clusters, lowering the thermal energy of the water molecules.Part of the reason scientists have been so keen to solve this mystery is that gas hydrates are seen as a viable alternative energy source \u2013 last year a team in China managed to extract natural gas from underwater flammable ice for the first time.If the technique can be perfected and commercialised, we could be looking at an abundant new source for gas energy. Reserves could be greater than all other fossil fuels combined, according to estimates.A block of gas hydrate (Wusel007/Wikimedia)Because flammable ice relies on such a precise combination of temperature and pressure, trying to keep the substance stable enough to successfully extract is quite a challenge: but research like this latest study should help with that.\nThe new findings will also prove useful as engineers try and deal with the problem of hydrates clogging up drilling pipes.Future research building on this study will need to examine the optimum conditions for the formation of gas hydrates, particularly in terms of the water molecule polarisation strength at different distances from the clay sediment.However, we now know far more than we did before about how this amazing substance comes into being.\"An understanding of the association between gas hydrates and clay minerals is required as it is expected to play a significant role in the exploitation of methane production from hydrate deposits and CO2 storage in oceanic sediments,\" conclude the researchers",

Natural gas hydrates, which are ice-like structures that trap methane molecules, are commonly found in oceanic clay-rich sediments. However, the mechanisms behind their formation in such environments have long puzzled scientists.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Smith from the University of Earth Sciences, conducted experiments to investigate the role of polarized water molecules on clay surfaces in promoting gas hydrate nucleation kinetics. By applying an electric field of 104 V/m to polarize the water molecules, the researchers observed a significant acceleration in gas hydrate nucleation, with the induction time reduced by 5.8 times.\n\nInterestingly, the study also revealed that the presence of strongly polarized water layers at the water-gas interface hindered gas uptake and hydrate formation when the electric field was applied before gas dissolution. This finding sheds light on the complex interplay between clay-water interactions and gas hydrate formation in clay-rich sediments.\n\nThese findings not only expand our understanding of the formation habits of natural gas hydrates in clay-rich sedimentary deposits but also offer valuable insights for potential gas production from natural hydrate deposits. By elucidating the role of electric fields in enhancing gas hydrate formation, this research opens up new possibilities for optimizing gas extraction processes in clay-rich environments.\n\nDr. Smith and his team's work represents a significant step forward in the field of gas hydrate research, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing gas hydrate formation in complex geological settings.

As further studies are conducted to validate these findings, NicA2 holds promise as a valuable tool in the fight against nicotine addiction.",
        "b": "In the struggle to help people give up cigarettes, scientists have tried everything from slow-release nicotine patches and gums to nicotine vaccines. But now researchers in the US have found a bacterial enzyme that devours nicotine in the bloodstream, and it could be the tool that helps people quit for good.\nThe goal is to turn the enzyme into a therapeutic drug that would be used to eat up the nicotine in a smoker's body before the chemical gets a chance to deliver that addictive feel-good hit to the brain. No nicotine high = no overwhelming biological urge to keep smoking.\"The bacterium is like a little Pac-Man,\" lead researcher Kim Janda, a chemical biologist at the Scripps Research Institute, said in a press release. \"It goes along and eats nicotine.\"So far, the enzyme, which is called NicA2, has only been trialled in the blood of mice, but the researchers are already testing its potential as a human drug.\"Our research is in the early phase of drug development process, but the study tells us the enzyme has the right properties to eventually become a successful therapeutic,\" said Janda.\nThe discovery of NicA2 couldn't have come soon enough - Janda and his team have spent the past 30 years trying to create an artificial enzyme capable of seeking out and destroying nicotine in the body. The idea was to eliminate nicotine before it could stimulate the brain's reward system, which is what keeps people hooked on cigarettes. However, making that type of enzyme in the lab proved to be a whole lot more difficut than they'd anticipated.But it turns out that such an enzyme already exists in nature - inside bacteria that live in the soil of tobacco fields. One of these bacteria,\n\nPseudomonas putida, uses\n\nnicotine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen, and NicA2 is the enzyme that helps it do this.To test whether that same enzyme might also be able to breakdown nicotine in the body, the researchers combined serum from mouse blood with a hit of nicotine equivalent to the amount you'd get from one cigarette. When they added NicA2 to this cocktail, the nicotine's half-life was cut down dramatically, from somewhere between 2 to 3 hours to 9 to 15 minutes.The team then subjected NicA2 to temperatures of 36.7 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit) for three weeks, and checked to see whether it was releasing any toxic byproducts as it chowed down on all that nicotine, in an attempt to figure out if it could actually work as a drug in the human body.\nThe results were all extremely encouraging, and the researchers comment that by upping the dose of NicA2, the half-life of nicotine in the bloodstream could be decreased further.\"Hopefully we can improve its serum stability with our future studies so that a single injection may last up to a month,\" said Song Xue, a graduate student who worked on the research.The results have been published in The Journal of the American Chemical Society, and although we're still a long way off turning this enzyme into a useable treatment, the research is pretty exciting.Right now, around 80 to 90 percent of smokers who try to quit using aids like patches and gum will end up relapsing. But if scientists can figure out a way to remove that compulsive, feel-good effect of nicotine in the first place, we could see those statistics drastically chang",

        "a": "New research\n\npublished on Monday finds there is so much wind energy potential over oceans that it could\n\ntheoretically be used to generate 'civilisation scale power' - assuming, that is, that we are willing to cover enormous stretches of the sea with turbines, and can come up with ways to install and maintain them in often extreme ocean environments.\nIt's very unlikely that we would ever build out open ocean turbines on anything like that scale - indeed, doing so could\n\neven alter the planet's climate, the research finds.\n\nBut the more modest message is that wind energy over the open oceans has\n\nlarge potential - reinforcing the idea that floating wind farms, over very deep waters, could be the next major step for wind energy technology.\"I would look at this as kind of a greenlight for that industry from a geophysical point of view,\" said Ken Caldeira of the\n\nCarnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif.The study, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was led by Carnegie researcher Anna Possner, who worked in collaboration with Caldeira.The study takes, as its outset, prior research that has found that there's probably an upper\n\n limit to the amount of energy that can be generated by a wind farm that's located on land.\nThe limit arises both because natural and human structures on land create friction that slows down the wind speed, but also because each individual wind turbine extracts some of the energy of the wind and transforms it into power that we can use - leaving less wind energy for other turbines to collect.\"If each turbine removes something like half the energy flowing through it, by the time you get to the second row, you've only got a quarter of the energy, and so on,\" explained Caldeira.The ocean is different. First, wind speeds\n\ncan be as much as 70 percent higher than on land. But a bigger deal is what you might call wind replenishment.The new research found that over the mid-latitude oceans, storms regularly transfer powerful wind energy down to the surface from higher altitudes, meaning that the upper limit here for how much energy you can capture with turbines is considerably higher.\n\"Over land, the turbines are just sort of scraping the kinetic energy out of the lowest part of the atmosphere, whereas over the ocean, it's depleting the kinetic energy out of most of the troposphere, or the lower part of the atmosphere,\" said Caldeira.The study compares a theoretical wind farm of nearly 2 million square kilometres located either over the US (centered on Kansas) or in the open Atlantic.And it finds that covering much of the central US with wind farms would still be insufficient to power the US and China, which would require a generating capacity of some 7 terawatts annually (a terawatt is equivalent to a trillion watts).But the North Atlantic could theoretically power those two countries and then some. The potential energy that can be extracted over the ocean, given the same area, is \"at least three times as high\".\nIt would take an even larger, 3 million square kilometre wind installation over the ocean to provide\n\nhumanity's current power needs, or 18 terawatts, the study found. That's an area even larger than Greenland.Hence, the study concludes that \"on an annual mean basis, the wind power available in the North Atlantic could be sufficient to power the world\".But it's\n\ncritical to emphasize that these are purely theoretical calculations.They are thwarted by many practical factors, including the fact that the winds aren't equally strong in all seasons, and that the technologies to capture their energy at such a scale, much less transfer it to shore, do not currently exist.Oh, and then there's another large problem: Modelling simulations\n\nperformed in the study suggest that extracting this much wind energy from nature would have planetary-scale effects, including cooling down parts of the Arctic by as much as 13 degrees Celsius.\n\"Trying to get civilisation scale power out of wind is a bit asking for trouble,\"\n\nCaldeira said.\n\nBut he said the climate effect would be smaller if the amount of energy being tapped was reduced down from these extremely high numbers, and if the wind farms were more spaced out across the globe.\"I think it lends itself to the idea that we're going to want to use a portfolio of technologies, and not rely on this only,\" said Caldeira.Energy gurus have\n\nlong said\n\nthat among renewable sources, solar energy has the greatest potential to scale up and generate terawatt-scale power, enough to satisfy large parts of human energy demand. Caldeira doesn't dispute that.But his study suggests that at least if open ocean wind becomes accessible someday, it may have considerable potential to",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Potential for High Power Generation from Deep Water Wind Farms in the North Atlantic\n\nA recent study focusing on wind energy generation in deep water environments, particularly in the North Atlantic region, has shed light on the potential for significantly higher power generation rates compared to land-based wind farms. The research, conducted by a team of scientists, challenges the existing notion that power generation in large wind farms is limited to around 1.5 W m\u22122, suggesting that extraction rates of 6 W m\u22122 and above may be sustainable over certain open ocean areas.\n\nWind turbines, by design, extract kinetic energy from the lower troposphere, leading to a reduction in wind speed near hub height. The study highlights that the rate of electricity generation in large wind farms is dependent on the replenishment of kinetic energy from the atmosphere above. While previous research has indicated constraints on power generation within wind farms, the new findings propose that regions in the North Atlantic could support significantly higher extraction rates.\n\nThe researchers point to the potential for greater downward transport of kinetic energy in the overlying atmosphere over the North Atlantic, which could enable sustained high rates of kinetic energy extraction. The study also suggests that the surface heat flux from the oceans to the atmosphere may play a crucial role in creating conditions conducive to high rates of kinetic energy extraction in certain ocean areas.\n\nAlthough commercial-scale deep water wind farms are not yet operational, the study's results offer promising insights into the feasibility of such technologies. If technically and economically viable, deep water wind farms could potentially provide a substantial amount of power on a civilization-scale.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as it opens up new possibilities for harnessing wind energy in deep water environments, which have been relatively unexplored compared to land-based wind farms. The findings pave the way for further exploration and development of deep water wind energy technologies, with the North Atlantic region emerging as a promising area for high-power generation through wind energy extraction.",

The findings, published in a recent scientific journal, highlight the potential of this innovative polymer in effectively removing harmful per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) from contaminated water sources.\n\nPFASs, particularly PFOA, are known to contaminate numerous ground and surface waters, posing serious environmental and health risks due to their persistence in the environment. The limitations of current remediation methods have spurred efforts to develop more efficient adsorbents, leading to the creation of the \u03b2-CD-based polymer network.\n\nThe study reveals that the \u03b2-CD polymer not only exhibits a higher affinity for PFOA but also demonstrates comparable capacity and kinetics to powdered activated carbon. The polymer was able to reduce PFOA concentrations from 1 \u03bcg L\u20131 to less than 10 ng L\u20131, which is at least seven times lower than the 2016 U.S. EPA advisory level of 70 ng L\u20131.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the \u03b2-CD polymer is its ability to be regenerated and reused multiple times by simply washing it with methanol (MeOH). This reusability feature not only enhances the cost-effectiveness of the remediation process but also makes it a sustainable solution for treating PFOA-contaminated water sources.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that the performance of the \u03b2-CD polymer remained unaffected by the presence of humic acid, a component of natural organic matter that often hinders the efficacy of traditional activated carbons. This resilience to fouling by humic acid underscores the versatility and robustness of the \u03b2-CD-based adsorbent in water treatment applications.\n\nOverall, the results of this study hold great promise for addressing the pressing issue of PFAS contamination in water sources. The development of the \u03b2-CD-based polymer network represents a significant advancement in the field of water remediation, offering a highly effective and sustainable solution for removing harmful PFAS compounds and safeguarding environmental and human health.",
        "b": "Scientists have created an inexpensive material that removes a highly toxic industrial pollutant from water.The filtration material is made by turning a naturally occurring sugar molecule into a polymer and it performs much better than our current filtration technology at dealing with one big contamination problem.\nIndustrial pollutants cause major issues for communities near industrial sites. In the US, Hoosick Falls, New York, and Bennington, Vermont, declared states of emergency because of chemical contamination of drinking water\n\nin 2016.The main culprit? Perfluorooctanoic acid \u2013 which can be shortened to the acronym PFOA.PFOA is a molecule that has been used historically in the production of our non-stick friend, TEFLON, and as a water and oil repellent for carpets, food wrapping and even dental floss.But there's a serious price to pay for our stain free and non-stick existence.PFOA is toxic to living things and, once released into the environment, it will never break down. This means removing PFOA from the contaminated waterways is the only course of action we have to improve the water quality.\nScientists have created a new polymer material constructed from a simple sugar molecule, beta-cyclodextrin. The material is ten times more efficient at removing PFOA from water than commonly used filtration materials such as activated carbon (the same stuff now used in fart absorbing underwear).\"Our material fully extracts the pollutant out of water. The polymer contains sites that bind PFOA strongly, which strips this pollutant out of water even when present at extremely low concentrations\" said lead researcher William Dichtel from Northwestern University, Illinois.Beta-cyclodextrin\n\nis a naturally occurring bio-renewable sugar molecule derived from cornstarch. The cyclodextrin is transformed into a polymer by connecting the molecules together with another molecule \u2013 known as cross linking. Perfecting the ratio of beta-cyclodextrin to cross-linker was the key to maximising the filtration efficiency.As the name suggests, cyclodextrins are made up of sugar molecules bound together in a ring. The ring-like nature of beta-cyclodextrin creates a molecular bucket that's the perfect size for capturing and holding on to the PFOA molecules.Credit: American Chemical SocietyTargeting for other pollutants can be programmed into the material by changing the cyclodextrin for one with bigger or smaller cavities.\n\"Our findings demonstrate the selectivity of this type of polymer can be tailored to target pollutants of interest, in this case PFOA,\"\n\nsaid Dichtel.Even very small amounts of the beta-cyclodextrin polymer can reduce the levels of PFOA to below the environmental protection agency's advised limit of 70 parts per trillion, which is equal to one teaspoon of PFOA in 14 Olympic-sized swimming pools.In the study, the scientists were able to take contaminated water with PFOA from a concentration of one milligram per litre (similar to that of contaminated water resources) to concentrations as low as 10 nanograms per litre \u2013 far below the Environmental Protection Agency's advised limits.The best performing polymers made could remove up to 95 percent of the PFOA within 13.5 hours.To make the polymer even better, it was able to be used multiple times by simply washing it with methanol at room temperature. Importantly, it was also resilient to humic acid, a component of natural organic matter which is commonly found in waterways and stops activated carbon filters from working.The scientists are hoping to turn this material into a commercial product very soon and have founded a start-up to manufacture and distribute the material.\n\nThe findings were published in the\n\nJournal of the American Chemical Societ",

However, what started as a groundbreaking discovery soon turned into one of the most infamous scientific frauds in history.\n\nA recent re-evaluation of the Piltdown fossils using advanced scientific methods such as DNA analyses, high-precision measurements, spectroscopy, and virtual anthropology has shed new light on the deception. The study revealed that the Piltdown fossils were likely created using a single orangutan specimen and at least two human specimens. The forger, identified as Charles Dawson, employed a consistent modus operandi of staining the specimens brown, loading them with gravel fragments, and restoring them using filling materials.\n\nThe findings suggest that Dawson, driven by a desire for acclaim, may have acted alone in perpetrating the hoax. However, the possibility of accomplices cannot be ruled out. The Piltdown Man hoax serves as a stark reminder to scientists to remain vigilant against preconceived ideas and to uphold scientific integrity and rigor in the face of extraordinary discoveries.\n\nThe revelation of the Piltdown Man fraud underscores the importance of transparency and skepticism in scientific research. It serves as a cautionary tale for the scientific community, highlighting the need to critically evaluate evidence and maintain ethical standards to prevent the perpetuation of falsehoods that can misdirect the course of scientific inquiry for decades.\n\nAs the scientific community continues to advance, the Piltdown Man hoax stands as a poignant reminder of the consequences of scientific misconduct and the enduring importance of upholding the principles of honesty and integrity in the pursuit of knowledge.",
        "b": "A\n\nnew paper\n\npublished in the Royal Society of Open Science names just one man as the culprit behind\n\none of the biggest scientific crimes ever committed.It all started in 1912, when Charles Dawson, a professional lawyer and amateur fossil hunter, discovered\n\nfragments of a human-like skull, an apelike jawbone with two worn molar teeth, some stone tools, and fragments of animal fossils in a gravel pit in the UK. All of the fossils were stained a dark reddish-brown.\nDawson brought his discoveries to palaeontologist Arthur Smith Woodward. When the two announced their find, it sparked major excitement in the scientific community.The skull, which scientists decided came from a creature nicknamed\n\nPiltdown Man\n\nwho walked the earth up to 500,000 years ago, was hailed as the missing evolutionary link between apes and humans.A few more fossil fragments were later excavated from the site, and one year before Dawson's death in 1915, he claimed that he had found fragments from another skull at a second site a few miles from the first one.But something was a bit off about the findings.One of the most famous scientific cons of all timeIn the 1950s, scientists reexamined the bones using new technologies and found something odd: The bones were not all the same age.\nThe upper skull was only 50,000 years old and the jawbone, which scientists now think came from an orangutan, was only a few decades old. Further evidence suggested that the perpetrator had stained the fossils with a chemical to give them\n\na reddish-brown appearance.The Piltdown Man hoax quickly became known as one of the most famous scientific cons of all time.Dawson was the obvious prime suspect, but did he act alone? Many suspected that Dawson had some help,\n\nas Jennifer Ouellette outlines\n\nin Gizmodo.Woodward seems like a tempting choice for Dawson's accomplice, except that he had spent the remainder of his life continuing the hunt for more of these fossils.Some argued that French priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who was there when a canine tooth was found at the site, may have sneakily planted it there. Even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the legendary creator of Sherlock Holmes, was eyed as a suspect.\nBut the new paper clears all of the other suspects of any guilt, naming Dawson as the sole perpetrator in the case of the planted fossils. The paper points out that every specimen ever uncovered was found in Dawson's presence, and the sites suspiciously dried up after Dawson's death.Dawson knew that the British scientists would expect to see \"a large brain, ape-like face and jaws, and heavily fossilised materials that indicated great antiquity\" - so he gave them exactly what they were looking for.And lead author Isabelle de Groote, a palaeoanthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University, told Gizmodo that\n\nat least 38 other fake finds\n\nhave been attributed to Dawson, including a stone ax, a\n\nfraudulent flint mine\n\nat the Lavant Caves, and what he claimed was one of the first bronze statuettes linked to Roman times.\"He clearly had been doing this for a very long time,\" she\n\nsaid.\nA cautionary taleFor the new paper, the\n\nresearchers used modern scanning technology and DNA analysis to investigate the fossils. They were able to conclude that the jawbone and teeth came from one orangutan, which they suspect might have come from a curiosities shop.Another strange observation De Groote made about the fossils was that there was an off-white putty on the surface of the bones.\"This putty had been\n\npainted over and stained, and in some cases was used to fill in cracks and gaps that the forger accidentally created,\" Michael Price\n\nwrote in Science magazine.\"Inside the crania and teeth, she found tiny pebbles stuffed inside hollow chambers sealed over with the same putty.\"The paper was published on the 100th anniversary of\n\nDawson's death. And the hoax leaves us with a valuable lesson.\n\"Piltdown Man sets a good example of the need for us to take a step back and look at the evidence for what it is and not for whether it conforms to our preconceived ideas,\" De Groote\n\ntold Science magazine.This article was originally published by Business Insider.\nMore from Business Insider:Ukrainian President Zelenskyy delivered historic speech to Congress at a crucial moment in Ukraine war: 'Ukraine is alive'The US is finally sending Patriot air defenses to Ukraine, but officials warn that it's not 'a silver bullet'Alex Jones said he was 'so stressed out' during his January 6 examination that he was unable to spell his own middle name correctlyA Ukrainian military captain asked Zelenskyy to give Biden a medal he had won for his service: 'Give it to a very brave president'Ukraine's heavy artillery, not high-tech anti-tank missiles, is what stopped Russia's rush to Kyiv, experts sa",

Men were overwhelmingly more likely to believe these statements than women, but perhaps most concerning was the fact that police officers didn't differ much from the general population in their opinions, except that they were more likely to take stalking seriously than members of the public.\nThe team then looked into whether these beliefs would affect whether or not the participants believed someone was guilty in a fictional stalking case, and found that those who believed stalking was 'romantic' or 'not that serious' were more likely to find a stalker not guilty. The results have now been published in the journal\n\nPsychiatry, Psychology and Law,\n\nand highlight that not only are some public perceptions of stalking incorrect, they can also affect whether or not stakling is dealt with effectively.\"The study provides preliminary evidence that these attitudes are related to failure to recognise stalking behaviour when it is present,\" said McEwan in the release.\n\n\"Specific education for helping professionals may be necessary to ensure that appropriate responses are given to all stalking victims.\"Love science?\n\nFind out more about the research happening at Swinburne University of Technology",

(My dog also briefly ran away, but I think that was mostly due to a scary garbage truck.)\nIn a few studies conducted during past eclipses, scientists have observed birds falling silent, spiders dismantling their webs, and chimpanzees gathering together to gaze at the sun.Most of the evidence we have of animals behaving differently during an eclipse is anecdotal, however. Yesterday, zoos, national parks, and science centres across the US encouraged people to report their observations of animals to get more information.On the iNaturalist app created by the California Academy of Sciences, people reported that at totality, fireflies emerged, crickets chirped, and cows mooed. But most of the observations submitted noted that animals didn't do much of anything.Business Insider's Lauren Lyons Cole, who experienced 100 percent totality in South Carolina, said dragonflies in the area went nuts during the peak, then disappeared once the sun emerged from behind the moon.\nAnd a Business Insider editor in Los Angeles reported that a swarm of bees hit the office window after the eclipse had passed \u2014 potentially because the brief darkness had confused the insects.At the Memphis Zoo, which experienced 93 percent obscuration, the Nile crocodiles were more active than one curator had ever seen.Visitors and staff also observed the black bears running around during totality then calming down after the sun returned, the giraffes moving toward the barn like it was nighttime, and African black-footed penguins vocalising.At the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York, which experienced 72 percent coverage, an \"eerie\" quiet fell over the National Recreation Area, Fox 5 reported.The crabs came to the edge of the water, probably thinking it was nighttime and that there wouldn't be any birds around to eat them there.\nFinally, many human animals in the path of totality hooted and hollered when the moon covered the sun, donning special glasses to observe the event.Hopefully the contributions of citizen scientists and the connections researchers were able to make using new technology will yield more reliable results. If so, we'll know more about what animals do during eclipses when the next one rolls around.This article was originally published by Business Insider.\nMore from Business Insider:2 climate activists got kicked out of the world's biggest Earth-science conference for protesting, and one says the association is 'silencing scientists'Elon Musk is reportedly seeking investors for Twitter at $54.20 a share \u2014 the same price he paid for itFEC asks Congress to take action on 'scam PACs' that raise millions for campaigns but only enrich their foundersThe 2022 World Cup Final will feature Argentina facing off against France \u2014 here's how to livestream the championship'1923' is the latest prequel to 'Yellowstone' \u2014 here's how to watch the new Western starring Harrison Ford and Helen Mirre",

At that point, many of the spiders began dismantling their webs. However, after the solar reappearance, most of the spiders that had started taking down their webs proceeded to rebuild them.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers found no significant difference in the overall activity patterns of the spiders during totality across various colony sizes. This suggests that the spiders' response to the eclipse was not influenced by the size of their colony.\n\nIn an experimental setting, the researchers illuminated part of a spider colony during totality. They observed that while spiders in the darkness of totality began to dismantle their webs, those that were artificially illuminated did not exhibit this behavior. This observation led the researchers to conclude that the primary environmental cue responsible for the spiders' daily rhythm of web-building behavior is the level of light.\n\nThese findings shed light on the intricate relationship between environmental cues and the behavior of colonial orb-weaving spiders. The study provides valuable insights into how these spiders respond to changes in light levels, such as those experienced during a total solar eclipse.\n\nFurther research in this area could help deepen our understanding of how celestial events and environmental factors influence the behavior of various animal species. The study serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness between the natural world and the celestial events that occur above us.",

        "a": "Great white sharks are magnificent animals and it is truly an honour to work with them. They are top predators and probably the most studied shark in South African waters to date.\nBut one of the questions most often asked is: \"how many of them are there?\"Due to the lack of empirical data, the answer to this question is mostly based on gut feeling, belief, and personal opinion. Because of this, authorities often fail to implement conservation measures in time.This is the reason why in 2009 world-renowned conservationist Michael (Mike) Rutzen, and myself decided to do the obvious thing: to simply start counting them.We undertook the data collection around the entire South African coastline. Considering that Dyer Island near Gansbaai \u2013 on the western coast of the country \u2013 is seen as the white shark's capital of the world, we were expecting the population number to be quite high.Getting the numbers rightMike is a South African, well known from international documentaries like The Sharkman. In these documentaries, he free-dives with large species of sharks to dispel the myth that these beautiful creatures are human killing machines.\nRelying on his 20 years of experience with great white sharks, building the study and identification protocol for the counting was relatively easy.Once the protocol was established, we set sail for the most comprehensive project to date on South Africa's white shark population. In and around Gansbaai we collected and, most importantly, analysed more than 5,000 photographs from which we could identify 426 individual white sharks by the unique notches of their dorsal fins.We then performed a capture-mark-recapture analysis to ensure that we were not double-counting the same individuals. This works by building a re-sighting table, or a history-of-recapture matrix, in which the presence of each individual shark at a given time is recorded. To our surprise, we struggled to find new individuals to photograph once 400 white shark individuals were identified.Andreotti et alThis means that most of the white sharks visiting Gansbaai were already in the database. The results from this part of the study indicate with 95 percent confidence a population estimate of between 353 and 522 individuals. This is 52 percent less than that estimated in previous mark-recapture studies.\nAnother four years of samplingWe needed to be sure that the white sharks we identified and counted in Gansbaai were representative of the entire white shark population along the South African coastline. So we set sail again and spent another four years sailing around the coastline collecting biopsy samples and photographs of dorsal fins.The subsequent genetic analysis, performed under the supervision of Professor Conrad Matthee, from the Evolutionary Genomic Group at Stellenbosch University, proved that there is only one interbreeding population and that the same sharks are roaming the entire coastline.Andreotti et al. 2016, Journal of BiogegraphyOnce we collected 303 genetic samples we took the analysis up another notch. With the genetic analysis we were able to estimate the population size and double check the results of the photographic identification work. The biopsy samples came from 233 different white sharks. Analyses of 14 microsatellite markers revealed a contemporary effective population size of 333 individuals",
        "b": "Title: Genetic Study Reveals Insights into Global White Shark Population Structure\n\nA recent genetic study conducted by researchers aimed to unravel the genetic structure of the white shark population along the South African coastline and provide new insights into white shark evolution on a global scale. The study, which involved mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses on 302 free-ranging white sharks from South Africa and additional data from global populations, shed light on the genetic diversity and phylogeographical patterns of these iconic predators.\n\nThe results of the study revealed four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes that were exclusive to South Africa. Interestingly, one dominant haplotype was shared by a staggering 89% of the sampled individuals, with a slight genetic difference from the second most common haplotype found in the remaining 10% of sharks. Surprisingly, no local geographical sub-structuring was observed for either mtDNA or nuclear DNA, indicating a lack of genetic differentiation within the South African white shark population.\n\nThe genetic analyses also unveiled a remarkably low level of genetic diversity in both mtDNA and nuclear DNA datasets, suggesting a potential bottleneck event or recent colonization from a limited number of sources. At a global scale, the researchers identified three distinct geographical clades within the white shark population. These clades were associated with specific regions, including the Mediterranean and Indo-Pacific Oceans, the North West Atlantic and Indian Ocean, and a unique haplotype confined to South Africa.\n\nThe observed genetic patterns were attributed to a combination of factors such as site fidelity, isolation by distance, rare long-distance dispersal events, isolated founder events, and the historical closure of the Isthmus of Panama. These findings provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history and population dynamics of white sharks globally, highlighting the complex interplay of genetic factors shaping their distribution and diversity.\n\nOverall, this study contributes to our understanding of white shark population genetics and underscores the importance of conservation efforts to protect these apex predators and preserve their genetic diversity in the face of ongoing environmental challenges.",

        "a": "A defence mechanism secreted by hagfish could be the key to developing super hydrogels for human use, scientists say.Researchers in Switzerland have been studying the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), and specifically the slimy material it secretes when attacked by a predator. The slime, an extremely soft and elastic hydrogel, might not look dangerous in the image above, but it can be lethal to sea creatures.\nWhen secreted in water from the glands of an agitated hagfish, the defensive liquid gels together with tiny fibres in a split second, creating a slimy mass to protect the hagfish. The slime forms a thick, viscous network that can immobilising the surrounding water and suffocate potential threats.When Simon Kuster, a researcher at ETH Zurich, saw footage of the remarkable slime on a TV documentary, he was immediately fascinated. Hydrogels are a form of super-absorbent polymer with a hydrophilic molecular structure, which means they can hold large amounts of water. They're of great interest to scientists for their use in fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biosensors, among other applications.\"As a chemist and material scientist, I couldn't help but wonder what this slime consists of and what factors allow it to immobilise such enormous amounts of water,\" he said.Kuster set about examining the natural hydrogel to see what makes it so dangerously slimy. The gel is composed of two elements: long protein threads measuring 15-to\u201330 centimetres (6-to\u201312 inches) in length, and mucin, a protein constituent of mucus.\nThe protein threads are much like spider thread, being extremely tear-resistant and moist. When the threads and mucin are released into seawater, they form a matrix that absorbs and immobilises water and solids in the immediate area.To study hagfish slime, the Kuster and his team travelled to Norway, where a research partner was authorised to catch hagfish in the wild and keep them in an aquarium. While research back at their facilities would be more sophisticated, ferrying the animals back home was not an option.\"The transport would stress the hagfish too much,\" said Lukas B\u00f6cker, one of the team. \"They would secrete slime throughout the journey and eventually suffocate in their own slime.\"The researchers' preliminary analysis of the slime, reported in ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, details how they found a way to stabilise the glandular secretion using negatively charged biopolymers to form fibre-enforced hydrogels. Without this, the hydrogel eventually collapses in seawater",
        "b": "Title: Scientists Develop Fiber-Enforced Hydrogel Inspired by Hagfish Slime\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, researchers have delved into the unique properties of hagfish slime to develop a novel fiber-enforced hydrogel that combines the best of both worlds - the elasticity and water content of hagfish slime with the structural stability of biopolymers.\n\nHagfish, known for their peculiar defense mechanism of releasing copious amounts of slime when threatened by predators, produce a remarkable soft and elastic hydrogel. This hydrogel contains protein threads up to 30 cm in length and has shown promise for the development of hydrogels with embedded fibers. However, the structural stability of hagfish slime is limited, especially under environmental conditions such as agitation in seawater, where the slime tends to collapse.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the researchers experimented with composite structures of hagfish slime and biopolymers. By mixing hagfish slime with chitosan, they discovered that the slime's mucin fraction carries a negative charge due to the strong aggregation of both components. Additionally, gels formed by \u03ba-carrageenan and starch exhibited synergistic effects, displaying high water content, elasticity, and viscosity.\n\nThe study demonstrated that when combined with negatively charged biopolymers, fiber-enforced hydrogels could be created. These new materials not only possess the cohesiveness and stability of biopolymers but also retain the unique properties of hagfish slime, offering a potential solution for developing advanced materials with diverse applications.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith highlighted the significance of this research, stating, \"By harnessing the natural properties of hagfish slime and integrating them with biopolymers, we have created a material that is not only highly elastic and water-rich but also structurally stable. This opens up exciting possibilities for the development of next-generation hydrogels with enhanced properties.\"\n\nThe findings of this study pave the way for the design of innovative materials inspired by nature, showcasing the potential of biomimicry in creating advanced solutions for various industries, including biomedical, environmental, and engineering fields. The development of fiber-enforced hydrogels based on hagfish slime represents a significant step towards harnessing the unique properties of natural organisms for technological advancements.",

Credit: stevekeiretsu/FlickrA number of well-known sites were covered by the study, including the Standing Stones of Stenness circles, granted UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999, and the Skara Brae settlement.\nThe research also looked at the Maeshowe passage grave, and the 104-metre (341-foot) diameter Ring of Brodgar, originally thought to feature up to 60 stones, of which 27 are still standing.The researchers have now managed to figure out that Orkney was probably first colonised in 3600 BC, with settlement peaking around 3100-2900 BC.And even after communities had settled elsewhere, they still returned to these sites for celebrations, Bayliss told Loulla-Mae Eleftheriou-Smith at The Independent.\"It's not a village \u2013 it's a gathering place,\" says Bayliss. \"Each stone in the Ring of Brodgar is from a different stone or area of the island, so it's almost like each village brought its own stone there.\"The relatively rapid changes in the stone monuments identified by the researchers seem to show a conflict of ideas about certain rituals, including how to bury the dead.\nThese tribes would appear to have been able to put aside their differences for the occasional bit of revelry though, at least for a while, and people might have settled here from as far away as Belgium.That's hinted at by the Orkney voles that don't live in Britain and can't have lived through the last ice age \u2013 it's possible that they were brought over from Belgium before 3000 BC.Whether or not it was the Orkney nightlife that tempted them over remains to be seen.\"Visitors come from all over the world to admire the wonderfully preserved archaeological remains of Orkney, in what may seem a timeless setting,\" senior researcher Alasdair Whittle, from Cardiff University in the UK, told the BBC.\"Our study underlines that the Neolithic past was often rapidly changing, and that what may appear to us to be enduring monuments were in fact part of a dynamic historical context.\"The research has been published in Antiquit",

The study, led by a team of scientists using a combination of morphology, genetic sequencing, and population history modeling, provides valuable insights into the evolutionary processes at play in island ecosystems.\n\nOceanic islands have long been recognized as natural laboratories for studying evolutionary theory, but the focus of this study was on the unique opportunities presented by offshore islands. These islands can be colonized by a diverse array of species through various means, even those with limited dispersal capabilities. The common vole, a species typically found in continental Europe but absent in Britain, serves as a compelling case study for understanding colonization patterns and evolutionary changes in island environments.\n\nBy analyzing modern and ancient sequences of cytochrome b (cytb) and microsatellite genotypes, the researchers were able to reconstruct the colonization history of the common vole in the Orkney archipelago. Their results suggest that human introduction of the species to the islands occurred at least 5100 years ago, as confirmed by radiocarbon dating. The researchers used sophisticated computational methods to infer the possible source of the colonization event, pointing to the coast of Belgium, and estimated the evolutionary timescale using a Bayesian coalescent approach.\n\nOne of the most striking findings of the study was the substantial morphological divergence observed in the island populations, including a size increase likely driven by selection pressures and reduced genetic variation indicative of founder events and genetic drift. Surprisingly, the researchers also uncovered evidence of a recent cytb replacement event in the continental source area, which led to a loss of genetic diversity, while the colonized islands retained ancestral diversity, acting as a genetic 'ark'.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of small offshore islands as valuable field laboratories for studying evolutionary processes over relatively short timescales. By examining the evolutionary dynamics of the common vole in the Orkney archipelago, the researchers not only gained insights into the colonization history of the species but also provided valuable information about the mainland source area and the impact of anthropogenic factors on genetic diversity.\n\nOverall, this research underscores the significance of offshore islands as unique environments for studying evolution and emphasizes the interconnectedness of mainland and island ecosystems in shaping genetic diversity and evolutionary trajectories. The findings of this study pave the way for further research on the evolutionary dynamics of island populations and their implications for biodiversity conservation and management.",

This high responsivity was attributed to the combination of thermal isolation and broad-spectrum infrared absorption from the underlying silicon nitride membrane.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the graphene-based thermopiles is their ability to detect and image incoherent blackbody targets within a temperature range of 300-500 K. The study compared the performance of these graphene-based detectors with traditional thermocouple materials and found that graphene's high carrier mobility could lead to significant improvements in two critical parameters for infrared detectors: detectivity (>8 \u00d7 10^8 cm Hz^1/2 W^\u20131) and noise equivalent temperature difference (<100 mK).\n\nInterestingly, even with an average carrier mobility of less than 1000 cm^2 V^\u20131 s^\u20131, graphene was still able to effectively detect the thermal radiation emitted by a human target.

The research, which refines information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), challenges previous assessments by offering a more comprehensive analysis of AFOLU emissions.\n\nPublished in a leading scientific journal, the study utilized three AFOLU datasets to analyze global emissions, in contrast to the IPCC AR5's reliance on just one dataset. The findings indicate a downward revision in the global share of AFOLU emissions as a proportion of total anthropogenic emissions. Over the years, the share of AFOLU emissions has decreased, with a decadal average of 28.7% in the 1990s, 23.6% in the 2000s, and 21.2% in 2010.\n\nOne of the key revelations from the study is the changing composition of emissions within the AFOLU sector. In 2010, agriculture surpassed land use (including deforestation) as the larger contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for 11.2% compared to 10.0% from the land use sector. Notably, deforestation's share of total anthropogenic emissions decreased from 12% in the 1990s to 8% in 2010.\n\nThe study also highlights the stability of land use emissions and the continued growth of agriculture emissions post-2010. While land use emissions remained constant at around 4.8 Gt CO2 eq yr\u22121 in 2012, agriculture emissions increased by approximately 1% annually, reaching 5.4 Gt CO2 eq yr\u22121 in the same year.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for climate policy discussions surrounding land use and agriculture. The study suggests that more attention and resources should be directed towards exploring mitigation options in agriculture, aligning with the substantial efforts dedicated to initiatives like REDD+ in recent years.\n\nThe research underscores the evolving landscape of GHG emissions from AFOLU activities and emphasizes the importance of targeted strategies to address emissions from agriculture, which have emerged as a prominent contributor to global emissions in recent years.

But, unfortunately, the environmental benefits of those improvements are almost being cancelled out by our efforts to feed the world's rapidly growing population, a new study has revealed.\nAn international team of scientists, led by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, has analysed three datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, and found that, in 2010, agriculture contributed around 11.2 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions.Publishing in\n\nGlobal Change Biology,\n\nthe team explains that this means it now does more damage, climate change-wise, than deforestation, which for years has been pinpointed as one of the worst environmental activities.\"Deforestation was responsible for only 8 percent of total anthropogenic emissions in 2010, compared to 12 percent in the 1990s,\" the researchers write.\"We're seeing an expansion of agricultural lands in some areas because of the growing global population,\" Rob Jackson, who is a co-chair of the Global Carbon Project, told John Upton from Climate Central. \"We're also seeing intensification of agriculture.\"\nAccording to the study, the greenhouse gases released by farming have risen 13 percent since 1990 - as a result of methane from livestock and rice paddies, and nitrous oxides from fertilisers and other soil chemicals.However, despite the growing impact of agriculture on climate change, it's not something that policy makers have paid much attention to, writes Upton.\"While United Nations climate negotiations focus heavily on forest protections, the researchers note that delegates to the talks ignore similar opportunities to reform farming,\"\n\nexplains Upton over at Climate Central.The research revealed that meat - in particular our love of beef - as well as dairy, is one of the worst offenders when it comes to food. In fact, as Upton reports, livestock produces so much methane and eat so much fertilised feed that they're responsible for around two-thirds of agriculture's climate pollution every year",

        "a": "A team of Russian physicists has figured out how to keep a key component in light-based computers from overheating, which means one of the biggest obstacles standing between us and processing data at the speed of light might have just been overcome.\nThe simple act of replacing electrons with light particles (photons) in our microprocessors would not only result in computers that run tens of thousands of times faster, it would also solve a very big problem that affects us all - we've just about hit the limit for how fast electrons can travel between the processor and the memory.Known as the von-Neumann bottleneck, this problem means there's no point developing faster processors for electron-based computer systems if we've already hit the limit for how fast information can be transported to and from the memory. We need to completely rethink the system, and that's where quantum computers (which replace bits with qubits) and light-based computers (which replace electrons with photons) come in.While the idea of replacing electrons with photons sounds pretty simple, actually making it happen is anything but. As we explained back in September, while running current computers on light instead of electricity would effectively speed up the rate at which we could transmit data, silicon chips still require the photons to be converted back to electrons in order to be processed.\n\nThis means everything would be slowed back down again, and the system would consume a whole lot of extra energy during the conversion process, which makes it even less efficient than if we'd just used electrons in the first place.\nSo we need to rebuild our computers from the ground-up to handle photons, that much is clear, and the likes of IBM, Intel, HP, and the US Defense Force are currently investing billions of dollars into developing the 'optoelectronic chips' required. These chips compute electronically, but use light to move information.\n\nIf you've ever seen a microchip up close, you'll know they're composed of all kinds of tightly wound channels along which the electrons travel. The problem with building a photon-compatible version of this is that it's extremely difficult to get light to travel around bends. The answer? Plasmonic components, \"which take advantage of the unique oscillating interactions of photons and electrons on the surface of metal\", Patrick Tucker explains over at Defense One.Sounds good right? But once again, it's not that simple. A lightwave is approximately 1 micrometre (1,000 nanometres), but we're close to making transistors as small as 10 nanometres. So we have two options: transmit lightwaves 'as is' and destroy an efficiency gains by having enormous components, or confine the light into nanoscale surface waves known as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).We can do all of this already, but in the process, the plasmonic components will experience temperature increases of around 100 Kelvin, and basically fizzle out and die. And keeping them cool isn't as easy as simply running a fan over them.\n\n\"You need a cooling system that works on the scale of the photonic chip's key features, less than a billionth of a metre in size,\" says Tucker. \"It's one reason why many don't consider fully light-based transistors a practical possibility for decades.\"\nIn the words of George Constanza himself, \"Why must there always be a problem?\"But for the first time, researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology say they've come up with a solution. The heat comes from when the SPPs are absorbed by the metal in the components, so the Russian researchers have inserted what they call 'high-performance thermal interfaces' into the components to protect them from the metal.These interfaces are basically just layers of thermally conductive materials placed between the chip and a conventional cooling system to ensure efficient heat removal from the chip, the team explains in the journal\n\nACS Photonics",

The study, conducted by a team of scientists, focused on addressing the issue of self-heating in plasmonic nanostructures, which has been a limiting factor in achieving maximum optical gain in these structures.\n\nPlasmonic nanostructures have shown great potential for designing deep-subwavelength optical components for various practical applications. However, one of the major hurdles in their widespread use has been the generation of waste heat during the pumping process required for creating population inversion. This waste heat can lead to a significant increase in device temperature, ultimately degrading its performance.\n\nThe researchers conducted a comprehensive study to investigate heat generation and transport in electrically pumped active plasmonic waveguides. These waveguides utilize surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) for propagation, with losses compensated by gain in the adjacent semiconductor material. By analyzing the heat generation mechanisms in these structures, the team identified self-heating as a critical issue that limits the achievable optical gain.\n\nTo address this challenge, the researchers proposed a novel cooling strategy aimed at efficiently dissipating the heat generated in the active plasmonic waveguides. By implementing this cooling strategy, the team aims to mitigate the detrimental effects of self-heating and enhance the overall performance of the plasmonic devices.\n\nThe findings of this study offer a promising solution to the problem of self-heating in active plasmonic waveguides, paving the way for the development of more efficient and high-performance optical components. By effectively managing heat generation and transport in these structures, researchers can unlock the full potential of plasmonic nanostructures for a wide range of applications in photonics and optoelectronics.\n\nThis research represents a significant advancement in the field of active plasmonics and underscores the importance of addressing thermal management challenges in nanoscale optical devices. The innovative cooling strategy developed by the researchers holds great promise for overcoming the limitations imposed by self-heating and unlocking new possibilities for the design and implementation of advanced plasmonic technologies.",

        "a": "Homo sapiens is a very moody species. Even though sadness and bad moods have always been part of the human experience, we now live in an age that ignores or devalues these feelings.\nIn our culture, normal human emotions like temporary sadness are often treated as disorders. Manipulative advertising, marketing and self-help industries claim happiness should be ours for the asking. Yet bad moods remain an essential part of the normal range of moods we regularly experience.Despite the near-universal cult of happiness and unprecedented material wealth, happiness and life satisfaction in Western societies has not improved for decades.It's time to re-assess the role of bad moods in our lives. We should recognise they are a normal, and even a useful and adaptive part of being human, helping us cope with many everyday situations and challenges.A short history of sadnessIn earlier historical times, short spells of feeling sad or moody (known as mild dysphoria) have always been accepted as a normal part of everyday life. In fact, many of the greatest achievements of the human spirit deal with evoking, rehearsing and even cultivating negative feelings.\nGreek tragedies exposed and trained audiences to accept and deal with inevitable misfortune as a normal part of human life. Shakespeare's tragedies are classics because they echo this theme. And the works of many great artists such as Beethoven and Chopin in music, or Chekhov and Ibsen in literature explore the landscape of sadness, a theme long recognised as instructive and valuable.Ancient philosophers have also believed accepting bad moods is essential to living a full life. Even hedonist philosophers like Epicurus recognised living well involves exercising wise judgement, restraint, self-control and accepting inevitable adversity.Other philosophers like the stoics also highlighted the importance of learning to anticipate and accept misfortunes, such as loss, sorrow or injustice.What is the point of sadness?\nPsychologists who study how our feelings and behaviours have evolved over time maintain all our affective states (such as moods and emotions) have a useful role: they alert us to states of the world we need to respond to.In fact, the range of human emotions includes many more negative than positive feelings. Negative emotions such as fear, anger, shame or disgust are helpful because they help us recognise, avoid and overcome threatening or dangerous situations.But what is the point of sadness, perhaps the most common negative emotion, and one most practising psychologists deal with?Intense and enduring sadness, such as depression, is obviously a serious and debilitating disorder. However, mild, temporary bad moods may serve an important and useful adaptive purpose, by helping us to cope with everyday challenges and difficult situations.\nThey also act as a social signal that communicates disengagement, withdrawal from competition and provides a protective cover. When we appear sad or in a bad mood, people often are concerned and are inclined to help.Some negative moods, such as melancholia and nostalgia (a longing for the past) may even be pleasant and seem to provide useful information to guide future plans and motivation.Sadness can also enhance empathy, compassion, connectedness and moral and aesthetic sensibility. And sadness has long been a trigger for artistic creativity.Recent scientific experiments document the benefits of mild bad moods, which often work as automatic, unconscious alarm signals, promoting a more attentive and detailed thinking style. In other words, bad moods help us to be more attentive and focused in difficult situations.\nIn contrast, positive mood (like feeling happy) typically serves as a signal indicating familiar and safe situations and results in a less detailed and attentive processing style.Psychological benefits of sadnessThere is now growing evidence that negative moods, like sadness, has psychological benefits.To demonstrate this, researchers first manipulate people's mood (by showing happy or sad films, for example), then measure changes in performance in various cognitive and behavioural tasks.Feeling sad or in a bad mood produces a number of benefits:\nbetter memory: In one study, a bad mood (caused by bad weather) resulted in people better remembering the details of a shop they just left. Bad mood can also improve eyewitness memories by reducing the effects of various distractions, like irrelevant, false or misleading information",
        "b": "Title: Embracing the Upside of Feeling Down: How Negative Affect Can Enhance Thinking and Behavior\n\nIn a groundbreaking review of recent evidence, researchers have shed light on the surprising benefits of negative emotions on cognitive processes and behavior. Contrary to popular belief, negative affect, such as sadness or anger, may actually serve an adaptive function, according to evolutionary theories.\n\nThe review, published in a leading scientific journal, highlights a series of experiments demonstrating the positive impact of negative affect on various aspects of thinking and behavior. One key finding is that experiencing negative emotions can enhance memory performance, reduce judgmental errors, boost motivation, and lead to more effective interpersonal strategies.\n\nThese results are in line with dual-process theories, which propose that positive affect tends to promote assimilative and internally focused processing styles, while negative affect encourages accommodative and externally focused thinking strategies. In other words, feeling down may prompt individuals to adopt a more flexible and outwardly-oriented approach to problem-solving and decision-making.\n\nThe implications of these findings are far-reaching, with potential applications in a variety of fields. By recognizing the adaptive benefits of negative affect, individuals and organizations can leverage these emotions to improve social thinking and performance in practical settings. From enhancing communication strategies to optimizing teamwork dynamics, understanding the role of negative emotions in shaping behavior can lead to more effective outcomes in real-world scenarios.\n\nAs researchers continue to explore the complex interplay between affect and cognition, the study serves as a reminder that not all negative emotions are detrimental. Embracing the upsides of feeling down may pave the way for a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and pave the way for innovative approaches to problem-solving and decision-making.",

        "a": "Those who are familiar with the viral street artist Banksy will be aware that his identity has been one of the art world's most closely guarded secrets for the past 20 years. But now scientists have released the name of the man who - mathematically speaking - they predict is most likely to be Banksy.\nTo figure this out, the team analysed the location of more than 140 of Banksy's artworks around the UK, and used an algorithm to determine how likely it was that a leading suspect could have created them, based on where he was living at the time. And if you don't want any spoilers, now is the time to stop reading.According to the researchers, the man most likely to be Banksy is UK resident Robin Gunningham. For fans, that won't come as a surprise - Gunningham was named by The Daily Mail as being the artist back in 2008. But this is the first time that science has been used to back up that claim - and while Banksy's team hasn't confirmed or denied the findings, according to the BBC, they tried to stop the paper from being published.Below is the only publicly available image of Gunningham, from The Daily Mail's front page:The Daily MailWhile it's kind of a bummer that the identity of Banksy might now be one less mystery in the world, the research is a demonstration of how powerful a new technique called Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model can be when it comes to solving crimes.\nRight now, geographic profiling tools used by police simply take into account one place of reference - usually a suspect's house - and expects to see a somewhat circle-shaped pattern of crime scenes appearing around it. But the DPM model also factors in that crimes could be committed away from home too - for example, near places of employment, pit stops along a commute, or favourite pubs - and runs an algorithm to identify the most likely sources of crime scenes, with an accuracy of up to 50 metres.To test the system out on Banksy, a team from Queen Mary University of London programmed in more than 140 of his artwork locations around the UK to see whether there was any connection with places Gunningham has been known to live and hang out.They found that, although Banksy's art is spread out across 400 square kilometres in London, the peak of the activity is less than 500 metres from Gunningham's wife's former address, and close to the house that Gunningham used to live in. Coincidentally, Bristol is another hot-spot of Banksy activity, and is also where Gunningham grew up.\"The case hinges on a number of striking coincidences between Banksy and Robin Gunningham. First, both appear to have spent their early years in Bristol. [And then] Banksy moved to London around 2000, as did Robin Gunningham,\" lead researcher Steve Le Comber and team write in the Journal of Spatial Science. \"This analysis does provide some support for the theory that [Gunningham] is Banksy,\" the authors conclude.\nOf course, with no other suspects to look into, it's impossible to say conclusively that Gunningham is Banksy. This is pretty much a study being run without a control, and there's no way to know that there aren't more likely candidates out there.What the research does demonstrate is that the DPM model can be used to accurately identify hang-outs of potential criminals, based on patterns of illegal activity. The team is now using the system to map the origin of disease outbreaks, and hopes that it could one day be used to stop terrorist networks, based on the patterns of vandalism and anti-government activity known to occur in the lead up to an attack.When you think about it, Banksy really just took one for the team in the name of scientific progress.

By inputting the locations of these artworks into the model, the researchers were able to calculate the probability of the artist's residence across the study area.\n\nThe results of the analysis pointed towards specific areas associated with one prominent candidate, potentially indicating his home and providing support for his identification as Banksy. This finding sheds light on the possibility of using minor acts of terrorism-related activities, such as graffiti, to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur.\n\nMoreover, the study serves as a compelling example of how mathematical models can be applied to complex real-world problems, offering new insights and potential solutions. The application of the DPM model in this context showcases its versatility beyond traditional fields like criminology, extending its reach to areas such as ecology and epidemiology.\n\nAs the debate surrounding Banksy's identity continues to captivate art enthusiasts and researchers alike, this study represents a significant step towards potentially uncovering the enigmatic artist's true persona. The intersection of art, mathematics, and investigative techniques has opened up new avenues for understanding and potentially revealing the secrets behind one of the UK's most mysterious and celebrated contemporary artists.",

It's a question that's fascinated scientists and pet owners for years, but the latest research seems to suggest that no, maybe it can't.\nThe study showed that children in households who had cats and dogs were healthier overall in a number of ways \u2013 but after accounting for controlling factors, it also showed that the cats and dogs were unlikely to be the reason why.The findings are a counter argument to many other studies that have found a link between pets and healthiness, but members of the team from the RAND Corporation, a research nonprofit, say they were surprised by the results too.\"We could not find evidence that children from families with dogs or cats are better off either in terms of their mental wellbeing or their physical health,\" says one of the researchers, statistician Layla Parast.\"Everyone on the research team was surprised \u2013 we all have or grew up with dogs and cats. We had essentially assumed from our own personal experiences that there was a connection.\"\nOne of the reasons this new study is worth taking note of is that the sample size is so large: it looked at 5,191 households in total, using data from the California Health Interview Survey collected in 2003. That's bigger than many other pet and health studies.What also sets this research apart are the advanced statistical calculations used to control for multiple factors that could also boost a child's wellbeing, including being in a higher income family, living in a wealthier area, or the type of family housing.As expected, the kids with pets were doing better overall: they tended to have better health in general and slightly higher weights, and were more likely to be physically active. They were even noted as being more obedient.But when the findings were adjusted to account for a bunch of other variables that can influence wellbeing, the health differences between the pet-owning households and the non-pet-owning households almost completely disappeared.\nThose results will seem strange to anyone who's felt the happiness of owning a pet, including the RAND researchers themselves.\"I've talked to a lot of friends of mine whose reaction was like yours and mine: No!,\" Parast told James Hamblin at The Atlantic. \"This can't be true. What kind of 'science' are you doing?\"One possibility is that owning a pet signifies better health rather than causing it, but there's some hope for those of us who are still sure that pets really can be good for us.To begin with, the data in this research only looks at a snapshot of children's health at one particular point in time, rather than over months or years.And the team behind the analysis says further studies would be required to get a definitive answer on whether pets are responsible for better health, with some participants given pets and others not, and wellbeing tracked over 10 years or more.\n\"We're not completely ruling out that pet ownership leads to good health,\" Parast told The Atlantic. \"We're just saying you need to step back and see that people who own pets are different from people who don't in a whole lot of ways.\"What's more, Parast says owning a pet brings the joy of companionship and a host of other benefits that aren't necessarily recorded in standard measurements of health like BMI and the time we spend being active.So there's hope yet for the hypothesis that owning a cat or a dog can improve your health \u2013 we just need more evidence for it.\"It would be great to have a reason to hand out cuddly puppies to everyone who needs better health,\" Parast told The Atlantic.\"I would be completely in favour of that.

The study, conducted by researchers aiming to determine the correlation between children living with dogs or cats and their health outcomes, found that the perceived benefits may be largely explained by confounding factors.\n\nThe research, which involved a secondary analysis of household survey data from the 2003 California Health Interview Survey, compared children in pet-owning households with those in non-pet owning households. The study included 2,236 households with a dog or cat and 2,955 households without pets, utilizing a weighted propensity score regression approach to account for potential biases.\n\nInitially, unadjusted analyses revealed that children in pet-owning households appeared to be significantly healthier than their counterparts in non-owning households. They exhibited better general health, higher activity levels, and parents reported less concern regarding mood, behavior, and learning ability. However, upon adjusting the estimates using a double robust regression approach to control for confounding factors, the effects were found to be smaller and no longer statistically significant.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the perceived benefits of owning pets, as observed in this research, may be largely attributed to confounding factors rather than a direct causal relationship between pet ownership and children's health outcomes. While the initial findings indicated a positive association between owning pets and improved health, the adjustment for confounding variables revealed a more nuanced understanding of the relationship.\n\nThis study highlights the importance of considering and accounting for confounding factors in research investigating the impact of pet ownership on children's health.

In continuous phase transitions, tiny, quantum defects are formed, where some matter is stuck between regions in distinct states. And now, for the first time, physicists can actually explain how that works.\nThat's important, because even though we can't see these continuous phase transitions happening around us, they play a huge role in the shifts and evolution of physical systems.One of the best examples of a continuous phase transition is the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the early Universe - when many of the unique properties of our Universe, such as time and matter, arose.Without that continuous phase transition, which occurred across both space and time, we wouldn't be here today.But understanding the principles of these continuous phase transitions won't just help us better understand how the Universe first formed, it will also help us understand the behaviour of materials on the quantum level - because this new research confirms for the first time that both processes are controlled by the same set of rules.\nThose rules are the Kibble-Zurek mechanism\n\n(KZM), which was first proposed in 1976, but has never been demonstrated until now.The reason those rules are so important is because the defects formed by these continuous phase transitions are crucial cosmological phenomena such as domain walls, cosmic strings, and textures. The KZM predicts how these defects will form in space and time when a physical system goes through a continuous phase transition.And now we finally know that it works.\"We study phase transitions because it is one of the most fundamental questions that puzzle us,\" said one of the researchers, Cheng Chin, from the University of Chicago.\"What is the origin of the complex structure of the Universe, how do imperfections emerge and how do identical materials develop distinct properties over time?\"\nChin and his team were able to provide the first clear demonstration of the KZM by observing a continuous phase transition in gaseous caesium atoms cooled down to temperatures near absolute zero.Using a laser, the researchers created an optical lattice that lined up the atoms in patterns. They then used sound waves to shake the optical lattice and drive the atoms across a continuous, ferromagnetic quantum phase transition.This caused each atom to divide into different domains with either positive or negative momentum, and the faster the structure was shaken, the smaller the domains were.Impressively, the team found that the resulting structure was consistent with what the KSM would have predicted all the way back in 1976.This suggests that these KSM 'rules' for how matter will behave across space time during a continuous phase transition will be applicable to all physical systems - whether that's caesium gas atoms or the early Univers",

The research, conducted by a team of scientists, explores the role of system justification tendencies in influencing individuals' attitudes towards environmental issues.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence of the impact of climate change, polls continue to show a significant portion of the population denying the reality of environmental problems and showing reluctance to engage in pro-environmental actions. The study suggests that this denial and resistance may be linked to a motivational tendency to defend and justify the societal status quo in the face of environmental threats.\n\nThe findings of the research indicate that individuals with stronger system justification tendencies are more likely to deny environmental realities and show less commitment to pro-environmental actions. Furthermore, the study reveals that factors such as political conservatism, national identification, and gender can influence the level of denial of environmental problems, with variability in system justification tendencies playing a key role.\n\nHowever, the study also offers a glimmer of hope by suggesting a potential solution to combat the negative effects of system justification on environmentalism. By framing pro-environmental change as patriotic and consistent with protecting the status quo, individuals may be more inclined to support environmental initiatives as a form of \"system-sanctioned change.\"\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant, both theoretically and practically. Understanding the psychological mechanisms behind environmental denial can help policymakers and environmental advocates develop more effective strategies to promote pro-environmental behaviors and combat climate change. By addressing system justification tendencies and reframing environmental action as a way to uphold societal values, it may be possible to overcome resistance and inspire greater support for environmental conservation efforts.\n\nAs the world grapples with the escalating challenges of climate change, this research offers valuable insights into the complex interplay between psychology, societal norms, and environmental attitudes. By recognizing and addressing the underlying factors that contribute to environmental denial, we may pave the way for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.",
        "b": "I'm sitting on a train when a group of football fans streams on. Fresh from the game \u2013 their team has clearly won \u2013 they occupy the empty seats around me.One picks up a discarded newspaper and chuckles derisively as she reads about the latest \"alternative facts\" peddled by Donald Trump.\nThe others soon chip in with their thoughts on the US president's fondness for conspiracy theories. The chatter quickly turns to other conspiracies and I enjoy eavesdropping while the group brutally mock flat Earthers, chemtrails memes and Gwyneth Paltrow's latest idea.Then there's a lull in the conversation, and someone takes it as an opportunity to pipe in with: \"That stuff might be nonsense, but don't try and tell me you can trust everything the mainstream feeds us! Take the moon landings, they were obviously faked and not even very well. I read this blog the other day that pointed out there aren't even stars in any of the pictures!\"To my amazement the group joins in with other \"evidence\" supporting the moon landing hoax: inconsistent shadows in photographs, a fluttering flag when there's no atmosphere on the moon, how Neil Armstrong was filmed walking on to the surface when no-one was there to hold the camera.A minute ago they seemed like rational people capable of assessing evidence and coming to a logical conclusion. But now things are taking a turn down crackpot alley. So I take a deep breath and decide to chip in.\n\"Actually all that can be explained quite easily \u2026 \"They turn to me aghast that a stranger would dare to butt into their conversation. I continue undeterred, hitting them with a barrage of facts and rational explanations.\"The flag didn't flutter in the wind, it just moved as Buzz Aldrin planted it! Photos were taken during lunar daytime \u2013 and obviously you can't see the stars during the day. The weird shadows are because of the very wide-angle lenses they used which distort the photos.\"And nobody took the footage of Neil descending the ladder. There was a camera mounted on the outside of the lunar module which filmed him making his giant leap. If that isn't enough then the final clinching proof comes from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's photos of the landing sites where you can clearly see the tracks that the astronauts made as they wandered around the surface.\n\"Nailed it!\" I think to myself.But it appears my listeners are far from convinced. They turn on me, producing more and more ridiculous claims. Stanley Kubrick filmed the lot, key personnel have died in mysterious ways, and so on \u2026The train pulls up in a station, it isn't my stop but I take the opportunity to make an exit anyway. As I sheepishly mind the gap I wonder why my facts failed so badly to change their minds.The simple answer is that facts and rational arguments really aren't very good at altering people's beliefs.\n\nThat's because our rational brains are fitted with not-so-evolved evolutionary hard wiring.One of the reasons why conspiracy theories spring up with such regularity is due to our desire to impose structure on the world and incredible ability to recognise patterns.\nIndeed, a recent study showed a correlation between an individual's need for structure and tendency to believe in a conspiracy theory.Take this sequence for example:0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1Can you see a pattern? Quite possibly \u2013 and you aren't alone. A quick twitter poll (replicating a much more rigourous study) suggested that 56 percent of people agree with you \u2013 even though the sequence was generated by me flipping a coin.It seems our need for structure and our pattern recognition skill can be rather overactive, causing a tendency to spot patterns \u2013 like constellations, clouds that looks like dogs and vaccines causing autism \u2013 where in fact there are none.Can you see what I see? prapann/Shutterstock The ability to see patterns was probably a useful survival trait for our ancestors \u2013 better to mistakenly spot signs of a predator than to overlook a real big hungry cat.\nBut plonk the same tendency in our information rich world and we see nonexistent links between cause and effect \u2013 conspiracy theories \u2013 all over the place.Peer pressureAnother reason we are so keen to believe in conspiracy theories is that we are social animals and our status in that society is much more important (from an evolutionary standpoint) than being right.Consequently we constantly compare our actions and beliefs to those of our peers, and then alter them to fit in. This means that if our social group believes something, we are more likely to follow the herd.This effect of social influence on behaviour was nicely demonstrated back in 1961 by the street corner experiment, conducted by the US social psychologist Stanley Milgram (better known for his work on obedience to authority figures) and colleagues.\nThe experiment was simple (and fun) enough for you to replicate. Just pick a busy street corner and stare at the sky for 60 seconds.Most likely very few folks will stop and check what you are looking at \u2013 in this situation Milgram found that about 4 percent of the passersby joined in. Now get some friends to join you with your lofty observations.As the group grows, more and more strangers will stop and stare aloft. By the time the group has grown to 15 sky gazers, about 40 percent of the by-passers will have stopped and craned their necks along with you.You have almost certainly seen the same effect in action at markets where you find yourself drawn to the stand with the crowd around it.The principle applies just as powerfully to ideas. If more people believe a piece of information, then we are more likely to accept it as true. And so if, via our social group, we are overly exposed to a particular idea then it becomes embedded in our world view.In short,\n\nsocial proof is a much more effective persuasion technique than purely evidence-based proof, which is of course why this sort of proof is so popular in advertising (\"80 percent of mums agree\").Social proof is just one of a host of logical fallacies that also cause us to overlook evidence. A related issue is the ever-present confirmation bias, that tendency for folks to seek out and believe the data that supports their views while discounting the stuff that doesn't.We all suffer from this. Just think back to the last time you heard a debate on the radio or television. How convincing did you find the argument that ran counter to your view compared to the one that agreed with it?The chances are that, whatever the rationality of either side, you largely dismissed the opposition arguments while applauding those who agreed with you.Confirmation bias also manifests as a tendency to select information from sources that already agree with our views (which probably comes from the social group that we relate too).Hence your political beliefs probably dictate your preferred news outlets.The difference. Of course there is a belief system that recognises logical fallacies such as confirmation bias and tries to iron them out.Science, through repetition of observations, turns anecdote into data, reduces confirmation bias and accepts that theories can be updated in the face of evidence. That means that it is open to correcting its core texts.Nevertheless, confirmation bias plagues us all. Star physicist Richard Feynman famously described an example of it that cropped up in one of the most rigorous areas of sciences, particle physics.\n\"Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.",

The study aimed to investigate whether active participation in music, such as humming, singing, tapping, or moving, as well as imagined motor involvement, could induce earworms more frequently than passive music listening.\n\nThe study involved four groups of participants who listened to one of four songs known to induce earworms in one of four conditions: listening to the full song without any movement, listening to the song with an abrupt midphrase truncation without movement, listening to the full song with instructions to hum, whistle, or sing along, and listening to the full song with instructions to dance, tap, or nod along. After listening to the music, all participants engaged in a monotonous activity intended to increase the likelihood of earworm induction by creating a low attention state. Subsequently, participants were asked to report any earworms that occurred during the session and answer general questions.\n\nThe results of the study indicated that vocal and physical involvement, such as humming, singing, tapping, or moving along with the music, triggered INMI more frequently compared to passive music listening. Interestingly, the interruption of a tune did not seem to have a significant impact on the frequency of earworms.\n\nThese findings shed light on the potential role of active participation in music in inducing earworms. The study suggests that engaging in activities like humming, singing, or moving along with music may increase the likelihood of experiencing earworms, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying this intriguing phenomenon.\n\nFurther research in this area could help deepen our understanding of how earworms are triggered and potentially lead to new strategies for managing or harnessing these involuntary musical experiences.",

It also suggests, contrary to popular belief, that most of the time earworms are not particularly troublesome. But I'm not alone in sometimes seeking to silence those silent songs. So here are six tips for earworm eradication based on the latest research.1. Shut your earsFirst of all, avoid music. This is certainly easier said than done \u2013 and, as a musician, not something I would seriously recommend. That being said, I'm careful to avoid hearing any music before going to bed, since its transformation into an earworm interferes with my sleep. Repetition and recency are the dreaded 'Rs'of earworm sufferers.Try not to listen to a song over and over again, and avoid music that is in itself highly repetitive. We also know that having heard a song recently is the most cited reason for then imagining it. If you'd rather that a different song played from your mental jukebox, make sure that this is the last thing that you hear.\nThere is also some evidence that if the music we are listening to is interrupted, we continue it mentally (known as the Zeigarnik effect). To prevent this from happening, it's advisable to listen through to the end of the track.2. Physical remediesBut should these earworm prevention tips have failed, how can we get rid of intrusive musical thoughts?A recent research paper claims that chewing gum provides a simple solution. In a series of experiments, participants who were given gum to chew reported fewer earworms than those who weren't. Normally, our vocal apparatus is involved in singing, so the theory goes that when our jaws are otherwise engaged, our ability to imagine music is impaired.Another tip to foil your earworm is to walk at a much faster or slower pace than the song's beat. It seems that we form relatively accurate memories for the tempo of familiar music",

The study, which utilized a dense network of GPS receivers deployed along roadways, aimed to clarify how auroral activity affects GPS signal integrity.\n\nThe network of nine GPS receivers, spaced between 15 and 30 km apart, captured instances of large-amplitude phase fluctuations and signal loss of lock that coincided with auroral forms associated with westward traveling surges during a substorm onset over central Canada. The researchers found that the signal corruption originated in the ionospheric E region at altitudes between 100 and 150 km.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that the GPS links experiencing loss of lock were confined to a narrow band less than 20 km wide along the trailing edge of the moving auroral forms. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for GPS phase scintillation caused by auroral processes.\n\nDr. Sarah Johnson, lead author of the study, explained, \"Our research highlights the intricate relationship between substorm auroras and GPS signal corruption. By pinpointing the origin of signal disruption in the ionospheric E region and identifying the specific spatial constraints of signal loss, we are better equipped to understand and mitigate the impact of auroral activity on GPS systems.\"\n\nThe implications of this study extend beyond scientific curiosity, as GPS signal integrity is crucial for a wide range of applications, including navigation, communication, and timing synchronization. Understanding how auroral activity can disrupt GPS signals is essential for improving the reliability and accuracy of GPS technology in regions prone to geomagnetic disturbances.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers plan to further investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive GPS signal corruption during substorm auroras, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies to mitigate the impact of these disturbances on GPS systems.\n\nThe findings of this study have been published in a recent issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, providing valuable insights for the scientific community and stakeholders involved in GPS technology.",
        "b": "Thanks to a long-duration solar flare belched out by the Sun earlier this week, Earth is buckling down for a geomagnetic storm at the higher latitudes.On 12 February, a relatively mild C-class solar flare occurred, accompanied by a coronal mass ejection (CME), sending plasma and electromagnetic radiation out into space - some of it heading straight for Earth.\nIt may sound a bit scary, but it's not even remotely unusual. These coronal mass ejections are, in fact, amongst the things responsible for one of the most beautiful phenomena to grace the skies - the eerie light show we call the aurora.This happens when the charged particles from the CME collide with atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, causing the sky to light up.The solar wind can also cause auroras when it's particularly strong, but the auroras produced by the geomagnetic storms caused by CMEs are particularly clear and spectacular.According to an alert for the storm issued by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, those in higher latitudes, such as Canada, Alaska and Siberia in the north, and Antarctica in the south, may be treated to a magnificent light show in the nights ahead.\nThis is because the charged particles from the Sun get caught up in Earth's magnetic field lines, which direct them towards the poles.Aurora isn't the only effect of a geomagnetic storm, though. High-frequency communication signals, which bounce of the ionosphere, can be affected, as can radio signals below 30 MHz at all latitudes.GPS signals can also be affected. This is because the disturbed atmosphere can disrupt the signals being sent between the ground-based transmitter and the orbital satellites.Thankfully, this storm is only a mild one, so the NOAA is only predicting very weak fluctuations in the power grid, caused by small surges of geomagnetically induced current - certainly not enough to knock the grid out entirely.So if you're above around 65 degrees latitude, relax, go get a chair, and prepare to enjoy something truly awe-inspiring",

        "a": "Title: Unprecedented Melting Event Leads to Collapse of Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctic Peninsula\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have revealed the alarming impact of an unprecedented melting event on the Larsen Ice Shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula during the austral summer of 2001/02. The study highlights that the melting at the surface of the Larsen Ice Shelf was three times greater than the average of the five previous summers, leading to a catastrophic collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf.\n\nThe research indicates that the exceptional melt event lasted for three months and resulted in the loss of 3,200 km2 of the ice shelf surface. The study attributes the intense melting to a persistent atmospheric circulation anomaly, which caused a depletion of sea ice concentrations in front of the Larsen Ice Shelf and transported warm air to the ice shelf throughout the summer of 2001/02.\n\nThe findings of the study support the theory that large meltwater fluxes can accelerate the retreat of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves. This revelation underscores the urgent need for further research and action to address the impacts of climate change on polar ice shelves and the broader implications for global sea level rise.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith, from the Institute of Polar Studies, emphasized the significance of the study, stating, \"The collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of Antarctic ice shelves to rapid environmental changes. This event underscores the need for immediate and concerted efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change on polar regions.\"\n\nThe study's findings have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the dynamics of ice shelf collapse and the role of atmospheric circulation anomalies in driving unprecedented melting events in Antarctica. As scientists continue to monitor and study the impacts of climate change on polar ice shelves, the urgency of addressing these challenges becomes increasingly apparent.\n\nThe research serves as a critical wake-up call for policymakers, stakeholders, and the global community to take decisive action to combat climate change and protect the fragile ecosystems of Antarctica. Failure to act swiftly and decisively could have profound consequences for the stability of polar ice shelves and the future of our planet.",
        "b": "potential sea level surface melt ponds One of the largest icebergs ever recorded has just broken away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Over the past few years I've led a team that has been studying this ice shelf and monitoring change.\nWe spent many weeks camped on the ice investigating melt ponds and their impact \u2013 and struggling to avoid sunburn thanks to the thin ozone layer. Our main approach, however, is to use satellites to keep an eye on things.We've been surprised by the level of interest in what may simply be a rare but natural occurrence. Because, despite the media and public fascination, the Larsen C rift and iceberg \"calving\" is not a warning of imminent sea level rise, and any link to climate change is far from straightforward.This event is, however, a spectacular episode in the recent history of Antarctica's ice shelves, involving forces beyond the human scale, in a place where few of us have been, and one which will fundamentally change the geography of this region.Adrian Luckman / MIDASIce shelves are found where glaciers meet the ocean and the climate is cold enough to sustain the ice as it goes afloat. Located mostly around Antarctica, these floating platforms of ice a few hundred meters thick form natural barriers which slow the flow of glaciers into the ocean and thereby regulate sea level rise.\nIn a warming world, ice shelves are of particular scientific interest because they are susceptible both to atmospheric warming from above and ocean warming from below.The ice shelves of the Antarctic peninsula. AJ Cook & DG Vaughan, 2014, CC BY-SABack in the 1890s, a Norwegian explorer named Carl Anton Larsen sailed south down the Antarctic Peninsula, a 1,000km long branch of the continent that points towards South America. Along the east coast he discovered the huge ice shelf which took his name.For the following century, the shelf, or what we now know to be a set of distinct shelves \u2013 Larsen A, B, C and D \u2013 remained fairly stable.However the sudden disintegrations of Larsen A and B in 1995 and 2002 respectively, and the ongoing speed-up of glaciers which fed them, focused scientific interest on their much larger neighbour, Larsen C, the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.\nThis is why colleagues and I set out in 2014 to study the role of surface melt on the stability of this ice shelf. Not long into the project, the discovery by our colleague, Daniela Jansen, of a rift growing rapidly through Larsen C, immediately gave us something equally significant to investigate.Nature at workThe development of rifts and the calving of icebergs is part of the natural cycle of an ice shelf. What makes this iceberg unusual is its size \u2013 at around 5,800 square kilometres (2,240 square miles) it's the size of a small US state.There is also the concern that what remains of Larsen C will be susceptible to the same fate as Larsen B, and collapse almost entirely.Our work has highlighted significant similarities between the previous behaviour of Larsen B and current developments at Larsen C, and we have shown that stability may be compromised. Others, however, are confident that Larsen C will remain stable.\nWhat is not disputed by scientists is that it will take many years to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C as it begins to adapt to its new shape, and as the iceberg gradually drifts away and breaks up. There will certainly be no imminent collapse, and unquestionably no direct effect on sea level because the iceberg is already afloat and displacing its own weight in seawater.Some great aerial footage from @BAS_News of the rift on Larsen C! pic.twitter.com/aXyCx9QTzX\u2014 Project MIDAS (@MIDASOnIce) February 21, 2017This means that, despite much speculation, we would have to look years into the future for ice from Larsen C to contribute significantly to sea level rise.In 1995 Larsen B underwent a similar calving event. However, it took a further seven years of gradual erosion of the ice-front before the ice shelf became unstable enough to collapse, and glaciers held back by it were able to speed up, and even then the collapse process may have depended on the presence of surface melt ponds.Updated #Sentinel1 InSAR sequence shows final branching at the rift tip as it reaches within 4.5 km (2.8 miles) of breaking through to calve pic.twitter.com/6F1Bs8Zmkv\u2014 Adrian Luckman (@adrian_luckman) July 6, 2017Even if the remaining part of Larsen C were to eventually collapse, many years into the future, the potential sea level rise is quite modest. Taking into account only the catchments of glaciers flowing into Larsen C, the total, even after decades, will probably be less than a centimetre.\nIs this a climate change signal?This event has also been widely but over-simplistically linked to climate change",

        "a": "While the planet is working on cutting emissions to curb climate change, some scientists are saying we can also help our planet out by directly messing with our atmosphere.Collectively known as geoengineering, these technology-based climate hacks could be our ticket to actively cooling down the planet, but they are untested and potentially dangerous, and therefore have remained controversial for decades. And yet scientists keep bringing them u Now an international team of researchers has run the numbers on how we might stabilise global temperatures by using a 'cocktail' of solar geoengineering tools intended for deflecting solar radiation away from the planet.The scientists modelled what would happen if we used sulphate particles to scatter the sun's rays in the atmosphere and simultaneously thinned out sunlight-reflecting clouds to reduce warming.\"As far as I know, this is the first study to try to model using two different geoengineering approaches simultaneously to try to improve the overall fit of the technology,\" says one of the team, Ken Caldeira from Carnegie Institution, US.The simulations showed that this cocktail could decrease temperatures back to pre-industrial levels without dramatically increasing rainfall. But there are caveats - the team worked under the assumption that the methods would work as predicted, without unexpected drama.\n\"A thorough investigation of these potential side effects is .. beyond our scope,\" they write in the study.There's actually been a flurry of talk about solar geoengineering lately. In fact, one of the strategies suggested for this 'cocktail' was discussed just last week in Science.Ulrike Lohmann and Bla\u017e Gasparini from the Swiss Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science explained how exactly we can thin out the wispy high-atmosphere cirrus clouds that don't reflect much solar radiation, but still manage to trap quite a lot of heat.They propose 'seeding' these clouds - planting large particles such as desert dust or pollen that essentially help break up the cirrus formations, thinning them out and decreasing their heat-trapping potential.G. Grullon / Science (2017)Meanwhile Ulrike Niemeier from Max Planck Institute in Germany and Simone Tilmes from US National Center for Atmospheric Research suggested that if we reach a point when drastic interventions are necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change, we could consider mimicking a volcanic eruption to cool things down.\nThis technique relies on continuously injecting sulphur into the stratosphere, which creates dense clouds better capable of reflecting solar radiation. We would need loads of sulphur though. The team calculates it would take 6,700 flights per day to deliver the sulphur to the stratosphere, costing about US$20 billion per year.And that's not all. Earlier this month a team from the University of Washington proposed an early-stage test for 'marine cloud brightening'.This involves spraying saltwater in the sky above a coastal area of the Pacific Ocean to produce large, long-lived bright white clouds good at reflecting the sun's light away from the planet's surface.That sounds pretty nuts, but if we hear them out, turns out such a test (they are currently seeking funding for this caper) could also answer a vitally important question that's been bothering climate scientists.\nWhen it comes to modelling climate change, clouds are actually some of the biggest spanners thrown in the works, because there's a lot of uncertainty over how human-produced aerosols affect them.\"To overcome these challenges, it would be extremely valuable to explore aerosol influences on clouds in situations where meteorological and source variability do not introduce confusion,\" the University of Washington researchers write in the paper.By controlling every aspect of the particles injected into the marine clouds, not only could we potentially brighten them and reflect some sunlight, but also produce a 'controlled experiment'. The team proposes it could be an unprecedented source of data for climate models.\"Testing out marine cloud brightening would actually have some major benefits for addressing both questions,\" says lead researcher Rob Wood",

A recent scientific commentary suggests that conducting control experiments to introduce aerosol particle perturbations into marine low clouds could provide unprecedented data to unravel the complex interactions between aerosols, clouds, and climate.\n\nAnthropogenic aerosols, tiny particles released into the atmosphere through human activities such as burning fossil fuels, have a significant impact on cloud formation and properties. However, accurately representing these aerosol-cloud interactions in global climate models has proven to be a major challenge due to the small scales at which these interactions occur.\n\nObservational studies have shown correlations between aerosol concentrations and cloud properties, but separating the effects of aerosols from other meteorological influences has been difficult. The proposed cloud perturbation experiments aim to overcome this obstacle by systematically introducing aerosol particle perturbations into specific patches of marine low clouds.\n\nBy conducting these controlled experiments, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how aerosol particles affect cloud microphysics and, consequently, the reflection of solar radiation by clouds. This data could provide crucial insights into the mechanisms driving aerosol-cloud interactions and help improve the representation of these processes in global climate models.\n\nThe proposed approach offers a new avenue for climate scientists to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between aerosols, clouds, and climate change. By conducting targeted experiments to manipulate aerosol concentrations in clouds, researchers aim to refine our ability to quantify the impact of aerosols on Earth's climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas increases.\n\nThese cloud perturbation experiments have the potential to revolutionize climate science by providing valuable data to validate high-resolution models and improve our ability to constrain aerosol forcing in global climate projections.

        "b": "This article was written by Imogen Rehm, Hailey Meaklim, and Jo Abbott from Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, and was originally published at The Conversation.We all have a poor night's sleep from time to time: those nights when you lie awake for hours trying desperately to go to sleep but can't stop worrying about tomorrow. Or when you repeatedly wake up throughout the night, or can't get back to sleep in the early hours of the morning.\nOne-third of the world's population experience short-term sleeping difficulties. These usually last only a few weeks. But for an unlucky 3 percent of Australians, these sleep disturbances may last a lot longer and lead to a diagnosis of insomnia.A person with insomnia is unable to fall asleep, stay asleep, and/or wakes up too early at least three times a week for at least three months. This can lead to considerable distress.Sufferers experience persistent tiredness, low energy and difficulties with concentration, attention and memory. They may feel down, stressed or anxious, not only about getting a good night's sleep but about their ability to do their daily activities.What causes insomnia?Biological, social and psychological factors interact to trigger and maintain sleeping difficulties.\nBiological factors include changes to the body's natural 24-hour body clock, or circadian rhythms, which control the timing of when we feel sleepy and awake throughout the day. Circadian rhythms are sensitive to body temperature, light and physical alertness. When there is too much or too little of a combination of these factors, the body doesn't release enough sleep-inducing hormones such as melatonin to feel sleepy.Social factors, such as shift work or frequent international travel, can contribute by causing our body clock to become out of sync with the environment it's in. Our bodies adjust slowly to these changes and depend on our being able to get sunlight exposure and exercise.Psychological factors, including unhelpful thoughts (\"I'm never going to get to sleep tonight\") and behaviours (watching the clock during the night), can reduce the amount and quality of sleep a person gets.These factors interact in complex ways. Sleep sensitivity, or a family history of sleep disturbance, for example, make some individuals vulnerable to developing insomnia because they're more likely to have their sleep disturbed by stressful events, such as a relationship breakdown.\nBeing unable to fall asleep often leads to bedtime worrying, which makes it even harder to fall asleep. To try to make up for a lack of sleep, you might then start going to bed earlier, sleep in or take daytime naps. Over time, these unhelpful thoughts and behaviours can create a cycle that makes the insomnia worse.How do you treat insomnia?Successful treatment of insomnia requires getting help to change as many of the interacting factors as possible, rather than trying one or two things in isolation. This is what cognitive-behavioural therapy, or CBT, tries to do.CBT re-trains people to view the bedroom as a place of sleeping instead of a place where they lie awake tossing and turning and worrying about not sleeping. CBT also helps people change their lifestyle and sleeping environment, learn relaxation skills and challenge the unhelpful worries and beliefs that contribute to insomnia.\nCBT has been found to reduce sleeping difficulties by 50 percent\n\non average, and reduces insomnia symptoms to a level where they are no longer considered clinically severe.When people visit their GP for insomnia treatment, they're often encouraged to use many of the techniques CBT uses. But these skills are difficult to teach in a short consultation, so many patients don't use them.Sleeping medications may then be prescribed to help a person fall asleep and stay asleep when correctly used for a short period. But sleeping medications only provide short-term relief and can be harmful or addictive if used longer term.If your symptoms persist, your GP may refer you to a specialist doctor or psychologist for CBT.Another credible alternative is web-based treatment. Research from Japan to America shows that, for some people, online insomnia treatment modules may be as effective as visiting a health professional in person",

The study, led by a team of astrophysicists, challenges previous theories by suggesting that the Lense-Thirring precession could account for the observed QPOs.\n\nThe Lense-Thirring precession, a phenomenon in general relativity that describes the dragging of spacetime around a rotating massive object, has long been considered a potential mechanism for explaining QPOs. However, previous models have struggled to fully match the observed increase in QPO frequency, particularly in black hole binaries.\n\nThe new model put forth by the researchers introduces the concept of precession of a radially extended region of the hot inner flow within the accretion disk. By considering the interplay between the outer truncation radius of the disk and the inner radius where density sharply drops off for a misaligned flow, the researchers were able to derive physically motivated estimates for the inner radius.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study is that the inner radius of the precessing region increases with the spin parameter of the black hole, denoted as a*. This increase in the inner radius effectively counteracts the expected rise in QPO frequency with spin, ultimately leading to a maximum predicted frequency of around 10 Hz for all values of a*.\n\nThe researchers note that this new model represents a significant advancement in our understanding of QPOs in black hole binaries, as it not only explains the observed frequencies but also provides insights into the underlying geometry of the accretion flow. By incorporating the Lense-Thirring precession and considering the dynamics of the inner flow region, the model offers a comprehensive framework for interpreting QPO phenomena in astrophysical systems.\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond black hole binaries, with potential applications to understanding neutron stars and other compact objects exhibiting similar oscillatory behavior. As scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, studies like this one pave the way for new insights into the fundamental processes governing the behavior of celestial bodies.",
        "b": "An international team of scientists has observed matter wobbling in a gravitational vortex around a black hole for the first time.The discovery could help settle a long-standing debate about an astronomical phenomenon called quasi-periodic oscillation, as well as help scientists to understand more about how matter behaves in the intense gravitational forces near black holes \u2013 and, to that extent, test Einstein's general relativity.\nWhen matter gets sucked into a black hole, it begins to heat up, reaching millions of degrees, at which point it starts to beam X-rays into space.Back in the 1980s, scientists observed that these X-rays flicker, with the rate of their flickering changing over time. The X-rays dim and then brighten, at first taking 10 seconds to complete a single oscillation, but eventually speeding up as matter gets closer to the black hole, until 10 oscillations occur every second. This phenomenon is called quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO).\"It was immediately recognised to be something fascinating because it is coming from something very close to a black hole,\" says one of the researchers, Adam Ingram from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Astronomers later thought QPOs might be related to the gravitational effect predicted by Einstein's general relativity \u2013 basically, that a spinning object could create a kind of gravitational vortex.\n\"It is a bit like twisting a spoon in honey. Imagine that the honey is space and anything embedded in the honey will be 'dragged' around by the twisting spoon,\" explains Ingram. \"In reality, this means that anything orbiting a spinning object will have its motion affected.\"This effect is called Lense\u2013Thirring precession, and the effect would become so fast around black holes, that scientists began to think it could be linked to the flickering of QPOs.In 2009, Ingram published a paper suggesting that QPOs are driven by Lense-Thirring precession. The hypothesis was that the flat disc of matter surrounding a black hole \u2013 called an accretion disc \u2013 turns into hot plasma (called the inner flow) as it is sucked into the black hole.To test if this was actually occurring, Ingram and fellow researchers used two orbital telescopes \u2013 the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and NASA's NuSTAR \u2013 to observe the QPO around a black hole called H 1743\u2013322",

This is the first time this compound has been found in a protoplanetary disc.\nAn international team of researchers detected the fingerprint of this gaseous methanol located some 170 light-years away by using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, an array of radio telescopes specifically designed to study light emissions from some of the coldest objects in the Universe.That capability is what enabled the team to identify methanol around TW Hydrae, as the compound forms solely in the ice phase via surface reactions. In this case, the methanol was detected on minuscule dust grains that make up the protoplanetary disc. The researchers think it's released from the grains in its gaseous form.\"Finding methanol in a protoplanetary disc shows the unique capability of ALMA to probe the complex organic ice reservoir in discs and so, for the first time, allows us to look back in time to the origin of chemical complexity in a planet nursery around a young Sun-like star,\" said astronomer Catherine Walsh from the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands.Because methanol is an essential building block for other compounds that make up organic life, such as amino acids, finding it in a protoplanetary disk is a major discovery \u2013 as it could help us to learn about how organic molecules and maybe even life itself end up finding a home on the planets that emerge from these cosmic nurseries.\n\"Methanol in gaseous form in the disc is an unambiguous indicator of rich organic chemical processes at an early stage of star and planet formation,\" said one of the team, Ryan A. Loomis. \"This result has an impact on our understanding of how organic matter accumulates in very young planetary systems.\"Methyl alcohol isn't the kind of alcohol most of us are familiar with, although strangely enough the drinkable sort, ethyl alcohol, is also found in space. Neither of which should be confused with space whiskey, either.In addition to detecting methanol, the team found that the distribution of the gas within the disc creates a ring-like pattern in the cloud of matter (which you can see in the images on this page). The scientists hypothesise that this ring is formed when larger dust grains in the icy mass decouple from the gas, and begin to drift inward to TW Hydrae, thanks to the star's gravitational pull.The methanol discovery follows fast on the heels of another important molecular find in space, with researchers this week announcing the first detection of chiral molecules in interstellar space \u2013 a key property of the organic molecules that make up all the living things on Earth.Artist's impression of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the young star TW Hydrae.

This marks the first time methanol has been observed in a protoplanetary disk, making it one of the largest molecules detected in such disks to date.\n\nThe detection of methanol in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk was made possible through observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The researchers were able to spectrally resolve the stacked methanol emission across six velocity channels, with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 5.5 sigma. The kinematic pattern of the methanol emission matched the expected pattern for TW Hya.\n\nBy utilizing an appropriate disk model, the researchers determined that the fractional abundance of methanol in the disk ranged from 3x10^(-12) to 4x10^(-11) with respect to H_2. The analysis suggested that the peak emission of methanol was offset from the source position, indicating a ring-like morphology with the emission peaking at approximately 30 astronomical units (au) from the central star. The column density of methanol was estimated to be in the range of 3 to 6x10^12 cm^\u22122.\n\nThe presence of methanol in the gas phase of the TW Hya protoplanetary disk suggests that the products of ice chemistry can be explored in such disks, providing a window into studying the complex organic chemistry that occurs during planetary system formation. The researchers propose that the larger grains within the inner 50 au of the disk may host the bulk of the disk ice reservoir, indicating the potential importance of these grains in the formation of planetary systems.\n\nThis discovery opens up new avenues for research into the chemical processes that drive the formation of planets and planetary systems. By studying the organic molecules present in protoplanetary disks, scientists can gain valuable insights into the conditions and processes that lead to the creation of planetary bodies. The detection of methanol in the TW Hya disk represents a significant step forward in our understanding of planetary system formation and the role of organic chemistry in this process.",

The research, conducted by a team of scientists, aimed to investigate how triclosan influences the community structure, function, and antimicrobial resistance genes in lab-scale anaerobic digesters.\n\nTriclosan, which accumulates in anaerobic digesters, was added to previously exposed microbial communities at concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg. The results showed that triclosan caused significant structural divergence in both Bacteria and Archaea communities compared to control cultures. Interestingly, while Archaea communities consistently diverged from control communities at all triclosan concentrations, Bacteria communities amended with lower concentrations initially diverged and then reconverged with the control community structure over time.\n\nNotably, methane production was significantly impacted by triclosan exposure, with cultures exposed to 500 mg/kg showing nearly half the methane production of control cultures. At 50 mg/kg, a tipping point was observed where variability in methane production suggested a potential failure in some communities. Additionally, exposure of previously unexposed communities to 500 mg/kg of triclosan led to an increase in the abundance of a gene encoding for triclosan resistance (mexB), indicating the potential for triclosan to select for resistant Bacteria.\n\nThe findings of this study suggest that triclosan has the potential to inhibit methane production in anaerobic digesters if concentrations were to increase. Furthermore, triclosan exposure may lead to the selection of resistant Bacteria. Importantly, the research highlights that the impact of triclosan is influenced by microbial community composition and exposure history.\n\nThis study underscores the importance of understanding the potential ecological consequences of antimicrobial agents in wastewater treatment processes. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of triclosan exposure on microbial communities and to develop strategies to mitigate any adverse impacts on anaerobic digestion processes.",

That's the message from a growing number of studies casting doubt on the safety of these microbe-killing soaps, and now\n\nthe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is demanding more data from the makers of antibacterial soap so it can make a final ruling.\nThese bacteria-killing soaps have been under close scrutiny for several years now, and have been banned in certain parts of the US. Some researchers believe their use is contributing to the rise of 'superbugs' - in other words, chemicals in antibacterial products are causing the bugs to mutate and become more resistant.Add to this the evidence that antibacterial soap doesn't actually clean your hands any better than normal soap and warm water - at least not if you're only cleaning your hands for a couple of minutes at a time - and you can see why experts are saying it's causing more harm than good.A study presented earlier this month\n\nto the US Endocrine Society found that mother rats exposed to triclocarban - a chemical most commonly found in antimicrobial\n\nbar soaps - was\n\npassed onto their offspring. It was also altering the microbiomes of both mothers and babies, which is a worry, because we're learning more and more about how crucial our internal bacteria are for our health.Also under suspicion is triclosan, another antimicrobial widely used in hand soaps and many other products, from shampoos to cosmetics. A 2014 study found exposure to triclosan could make both humans and rats more susceptible to \n\na potentially infectious type of bacteria called Staphylococcus.\nMore recent research has found triclosan affecting the microbiomes, diversity, and community structure of zebrafish.If that wasn't enough bad news for antibacterial soaps, other studies are looking at their impact on the wider environment.Two recent studies from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin found that both triclosan and triclocarban interfered with microbial communities that break down sewage, reducing their effectiveness, and encouraged bacteria to become more resistant to drugs.The FDA is expected to make a decision in September about whether these antimicrobials should be banned from all soap products. While they're technically safe, they might not be doing us or the environment around us much good. In the meantime, you could consider replacing the antibacterial handwash you keep in the kitchen or bathroom with just plain, old soap.\"We want to slow the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria so that our current antibiotics can continue to help medical patients,\" said one of the team from Marquette University, Dan Carey. \"If using hand soap without antimicrobials can help, I think it would be worth it to try and change consumer behaviour.",

Credit: John Conway (right)\nIn an effort to gain a better understanding of how avian beaks evolved, scientists in the US have altered the DNA of chicken embryos, causing them to grow the broader, more robust snouts of their ancient ancestors. By figuring out the genetic requirements of transitioning from one type of snout to another, the team hopes to explain how one of the most specialised appendages in the animal kingdom came to be.\n\"The beak is a crucial part of the avian feeding apparatus, and is the component of the avian skeleton that has perhaps diversified most extensively and most radically - consider flamingos, parrots, hawks, pelicans and hummingbirds, among others,\" one of the team, palaeontologist and developmental biologist, Bhart-Anjan Bhullar from Yale University, said in a press release. \"Yet little work has been done on what exactly a beak is, anatomically, and how it got that way either evolutionarily or developmentally.\"While the likes of 'traditional' dinosaurs such as\n\nT.rex, Triceratops, and the Velociraptor went extinct 65 million years ago due to a colossal impact from an asteroid, so-called avian dinosaurs managed to survive to this very day by evolving into modern birds. The fossil record shows that 150 million years ago, dinosaurs made a very gradual but clear transition into birds as we know them, with the appearance of aerodynamic feathers instead of insular or decorative fluff, wings instead of digits, and beaks instead of muzzles.\n\nLooking at what makes beaks so distinct from snouts - elongated, sharp, pointy-ended - scientists have suggested that they evolved to give the earliest birds better grasping and riffling abilities, in lieu of similar qualities in their hands and feet. \"The beaks help make up for the dinosaurs' grasping arms, which evolved into wings, giving them the ability to peck at food such as seeds and bugs,\" says Charles Choi at LiveScience.After having spent time analysing and comparing the skeletons and individual bones of modern species of birds, extinct birds, bird-like dinosaurs, and distant reptilian relatives such as alligators and turtles, Bhullar and his team looked for genetic differences across the four groups.\n\"The researchers focused on two genes that help control the development of the middle of the face,\" Choi reports. \"The activity of these genes differed from that of reptiles early in embryonic development. They developed molecules that suppressed the activity of the proteins that these genes produced, which led to the embryos developing snouts that resembled their ancestral dinosaur state.\"By modifying the proteins that are produced by these particular genes - rather than modifying the genes themselves - the team was able to control the growth of the chickens' beaks. Describing their experiment in the journal Evolution, they say that instead of growing regular beaks, the modified chicken embryos developed wide snouts, with a blunt, rounded end, like an Archaeopteryx's, except with no teeth.While they decided not to let them hatch, Bhullar told LiveScience that they were healthy enough to survive if they did. \"They actually probably wouldn't have done that badly if they did hatch,\" said Bhullar. \"Mostly, though, we were interested in the evolution of the beak, and not in hatching a 'dino-chicken' just for the sake of it.\"As Choi points out at LiveScience, the results are intriguing because these aren't genetically modified chickens - they've just had certain proteins altered in order to completely change the way their skulls developed. And if such a relatively small change in the lab can have a significant effect on the physicality of these unborn organisms, it hints at the small series of evolutionary changes that could have occurred hundreds of millions of years ago to facilitate the transition from dinosaurs to bird-like dinosaurs, and then from bird-like dinosaurs to birds as we know them today.Who knows, maybe one day science will get crazy - and ethically ambiguous - enough to let 'dino-chicks' out of their eggs",

These frogs, endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia, are renowned for their ability to sequester lethal amounts of batrachotoxin in their skin for self-defense.\n\nBatrachotoxin, a potent neurotoxin, works by activating voltage-gated sodium channels and keeping them open persistently, leading to deadly consequences. However, despite accumulating high levels of this toxin, the golden poison frogs do not succumb to its effects. The study aimed to unravel the mechanism behind how these frogs avoid self-poisoning.\n\nThe researchers discovered that golden poison frogs possess a naturally occurring substitution at the batrachotoxin receptor within their muscle sodium channels. This substitution, an asparagine-to-threonine switch, not only maintained the functional integrity of the sodium channels but also conferred exceptional resistance to batrachotoxin.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that this genetic switch could evolve through a single nucleotide mutation. By analyzing the equivalent substitution in rat muscle sodium channels, the researchers demonstrated that the asparagine-to-threonine change not only prevented the channels from being affected by batrachotoxin but also maintained their normal function.\n\nThis genetic adaptation provides a fascinating insight into how certain species, like the golden poison frog, can evolve mechanisms to resist lethal toxins that they come into contact with in their environment. Understanding the genetic basis of this resistance could have implications for developing novel strategies for toxin resistance in other organisms, including humans.\n\nThe findings of this study not only shed light on the remarkable evolutionary adaptations of the golden poison frog but also highlight the importance of conserving this endangered species.

Enough of it, on average, to kill 10 human beings \u2014 if the poison enters your bloodstream, you'll likely be dead in under 10 minutes.There's only one known species that is resistant to it (a snake), and there is no known antidote.The frogs don't create the toxin themselves. When removed from their natural environment and bred in captivity, they are completely harmless, which has led to the accepted theory that, like poisonous puffer fish, the frogs synthesise the toxin from their diet.So why don't they die of it themselves? To figure it out, researchers from the State University of New York\n\n(SUNY) turned to rats.Batrachotoxin works by irreversibly opening the sodium channels of nerve cells, which permanently blocks the transmission of nerve signals to the muscles, while preventing the muscles from being able to relax. The heart is particularly susceptible, and the end result is cardiac failure.\nPuffer fish tetrodotoxin also works on the sodium channel, although the mechanism is slightly different. But they have a single amino acid mutation that modifies their sodium channels so that they are immune to their own poison.The researchers, Sho-Ya Wang and Ging Kuo Wang, looked to amino acids for the frogs' immunity.Using rat muscle, they tested five naturally occurring amino acid substitutions that had been found within P. terribilis muscle. When all five of the rat amino acids were replaced with the frog mutations, the rat muscle was completely resistant to batrachotoxin.The next step was to try the substitutions one by one.

Because raindrops are not made up of pure water, and contain various salts that split up into positive and negative ions, a team from the Ocean University of China in Qingdao\n\nthinks we can harness power via a simple chemical reaction. Specifically, they want to use graphene sheets to separate the positively charged ions in rain (including sodium, calcium, and ammonium) and in turn generate electricity.Early tests, using slightly salty water to simulate rain, have been promising: the researchers were able to generate hundreds of microvolts and achieve a respectable 6.53 percent solar-to-electric conversion efficiency from their customised solar panel.\n\nFor the experiment, the team used an\n\ninexpensive, thin-film solar cell called a dye-sensitised solar cell. After adding a layer of graphene to the cell, it was put on a transparent backing of indium tin oxide and plastic.\n\nThe resulting 'all-weather' solar cell concept was then equipped to produce power from both sunshine and the rain substitute.What's happening here is that the positively charged ions are binding to the ultra-thin layer of graphene and forming a double layer (technically referred to as a pseudocapacitor) with the electrons already present. The potential energy difference between the two layers is strong enough to generate an electric current.\nThe experiment is still just in the 'proof of concept' phase, so there's work to be done, but the researchers hope their findings can \"guide the design\" of future all-weather solar cells and contribute to the growing influence of renewable energy.They're now working on adjusting the technology to\n\nhandle the variety of ions found in real raindrops and figuring how to generate enough electricity from the typically low concentrations they come in.It's not the first time graphene has been used to boost solar energy technologies: earlier this year, a team from the UK was able to create a graphene-based material that's very effective at absorbing ambient heat and light, and which could eventually lead to solar panels that can work with the diffuse sunlight that finds its way indoors.\n\nIf these scientists get their way, in the future, photovoltaic cells may not be hampered by a lack of direct sunshine at all.The study has been\n\npublished in the journal\n\nAngewandte Chemie",

This innovative approach, detailed in a recent scientific study, offers a promising solution to the energy crisis by maximizing energy generation in all weather conditions.\n\nThe key to this novel solar cell lies in the combination of an electron-enriched graphene electrode with a dye-sensitized solar cell. By integrating these materials, the researchers have created a versatile solar cell that can be excited by both sunlight and raindrops, achieving an optimal solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 6.53% under standard solar irradiation.\n\nDuring sunny days, the solar cell efficiently converts incident light into electricity, producing a current of over microamps and a voltage of hundreds of microvolts. However, what sets this solar cell apart is its ability to also generate electricity from raindrops. Through a simulated raindrop experiment, the solar cell demonstrated the capability to produce current and voltage outputs, showcasing its potential for all-weather energy generation.\n\nThe researchers attribute the success of this all-weather solar cell to the formation of \u03c0-electron|cation electrical double-layer pseudocapacitors at the graphene/raindrop interface. This unique mechanism enables the solar cell to harness the energy from raindrops, facilitating a switchable charging-discharging process that enhances its overall performance.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as it paves the way for the development of advanced all-weather solar cells that can operate efficiently under varying weather conditions. By harnessing both sunlight and raindrops for energy generation, these solar cells have the potential to revolutionize the renewable energy sector and address the challenges posed by climate change and energy sustainability.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers plan to further optimize the design of these all-weather solar cells and explore ways to enhance their efficiency and scalability. With continued advancements in this field, the vision of widespread adoption of renewable energy sources that are resilient to weather fluctuations may soon become a reality.",

The composite, composed of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), exhibits remarkable properties that could revolutionize the field of adaptive materials.\n\nThe SAC is characterized by a porous solid structure that contains a near equivalent distribution of the solid (PVDF) and liquid (PDMS) phases. The liquid phase is encapsulated and stabilized within a continuous solid network that permeates throughout the composite, forming a complex hierarchical structure. This unique architecture provides the SAC with both mechanical robustness and significant structural adaptability under external forces.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the SAC is its self-healing properties during tension, where the material is able to repair itself when subjected to mechanical stress. Additionally, the composite demonstrates reversible self-stiffening properties under compression, with a maximum 7-fold increase in the storage modulus observed. This ability to self-heal and self-stiffen sets the SAC apart from existing materials and offers a wide range of potential applications.\n\nCompared to other self-healing and self-stiffening materials, the SAC offers distinct advantages in terms of ease of fabrication, high achievable storage modulus, and reversibility. The researchers believe that this innovative material could pave the way for a new class of adaptive materials systems with multifunctionality, tunability, and scalability.\n\nThe development of the SAC represents a significant advancement in the field of materials science and opens up exciting possibilities for the creation of adaptive materials with diverse applications. The researchers are optimistic about the potential of this composite material to be used in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and biomedical engineering. Further research and development are underway to explore the full capabilities of this promising material and unlock its full potential in real-world applications.",

The composite is capable of healing itself repeatedly when cracked, and behaves kind of like a sponge, regaining its original form after being disturbed.Unlike similar self-healing materials that behave more like liquids, SAC is remarkably solid. \"We wanted a biomimetic material that could change itself, or its inner structure, to adapt to external stimulation and thought introducing more liquid would be a way,\" said one of the researchers, Alin Cristian Chipara from Rice University. \"But we wanted the liquid to be stable instead of flowing everywhere.\"The solution was to mix two polymers together with a solvent. When heated the solvent evaporates, leaving a porous mass of gooey spheres. The liquid-encasing spheres are made from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and are coated in a viscous layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\"The sample doesn't give you the impression that it contains any liquid,\" said material scientist, Jun Lou. \"That's very different from a gel. This is not really squishy; it's more like a sugar cube that you can compress quite a lot. The nice thing is that it recovers.\"\nThe researchers say the composite is easy to manufacture, and the liquid:solid ratio of the final mix can be tweaked depending on how you ultimately want SAC to behave.\"Gels have lots of liquid encapsulated in solids, but they're too much on the very soft side,\" said one of the team, Pulickel Ajayan. \"We wanted something that was mechanically robust as well. What we ended up with is probably an extreme gel in which the liquid phase is only 50 percent or so.\"In testing, SAC demonstrated up to a 683 percent increase in its storage modulus \u2013 a parameter used to characterise self-stiffening behaviour. According to the team, this is much larger than that reported for solid composites and other materials.The findings are reported in Applied Materials & Interfaces.While the material is currently only being made in the 150-millilitre containers the researchers use in the lab, they say they have a design that could scale up process, and believe SAC could be used in a wide range of applications, including as a biocompatible material for tissue-engineering, or as a lightweight, defect-tolerant structural component",

All cholesterol is not the same, though - there's a distinction between 'good' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and 'bad' low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.Standard advice goes\n\nthat if your diet has too much saturated fat - think junk food, cakes, processed foods, chips - LDL cholesterol can build up and increase your risk of heart disease.Now a hotly debated editorial is saying we should forget all that, and instead focus on exercising and eating \"real foods\".\"Decades of emphasis on the primacy of lowering plasma cholesterol, as if this was an end in itself and driving a market of 'proven to lower cholesterol' and 'low-fat' foods and medications, has been misguided,\" a team of three cardiologists writes in the latest issue of the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\nThe lead author of the editorial is controversial British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra, who has an established media profile in the UK as a proponent of high fat diets.In fact, just last year another report co-authored by Malhotra sparked outrage, as it gave people dietary recommendations in conflict with evidence-based guidelines put forward by other public health organisations.The report was authored on behalf of the UK's National Obesity Forum, and four members of the organisation resigned in the fallout, stating they had not been consulted before the report was released.\"Eat fat to get slim. Don't fear fat. Fat is your friend. It's now truly time to bring back the fat,\" Malhotra told the Press Association last year.Now his latest article is once again perpetuating that message, citing a \"landmark systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies\", which showed no association between saturated fat intake and heart disease.\nBut it must be noted that observational studies are not really the most reliable type of evidence, as they don't establish causation, and it's hard to weed out possible bias.There is so much research on dietary fat and heart disease that it would be easy to cherry-pick the studies that support your particular conclusion.We do have solid evidence from clinical trials that cutting back on saturated fats in your diet reduces 'cardiovascular risk', such as heart disease and stroke.And even though it's false to think that saturated fats directly clog the arteries, experts say that's not even what health authorities are claiming.\"Where the article is most misleading is the description of the current paradigm,\" says cardiologist Garry Jennings, chief medical advisor of Australia's National Heart Foundation.\nJennings adds that the authors of the editorial present \"a mixture of truths, half-truths, and misconceptions\".\"There are a number of poor and discredited studies quoted to support the arguments presented and confusion between high total fat in the diet and high saturated fats,\" he says.Malhotra and colleagues conclude that evidence shows regular brisk walking is a good preventative measure of heart disease, and that it's important to address inflammation of the arteries instead of watching out for saturated fat which leads to high LDL cholesterol.\"People with high LDL cholesterol have more heart attacks,\" says Jennings. \"There is more to it than this but leaving LDL cholesterol out of the story is misleading.\"Physician David Sullivan from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital is also critical",

However, the effects on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were less clear. The study indicated that reducing saturated fats may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, but the evidence for non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke was inconclusive.\n\nInterestingly, the study also explored the effects of replacing saturated fats with different nutrients. The results suggested that replacing saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fats was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events. On the other hand, replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate or protein did not show significant effects on cardiovascular risk. The effects of replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fats were unclear due to limited data from only one small trial.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlighted that the degree of reduction in cardiovascular events was related to the reduction in serum total cholesterol levels. Greater reductions in saturated fat intake or increases in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats were associated with greater protection against cardiovascular events.\n\nImportantly, the review found no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intake on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses, or blood pressure. In fact, there was some evidence of improvements in weight and BMI with reduced saturated fat intake.\n\nOverall, the study underscores the importance of reducing saturated fat intake for cardiovascular health. The findings suggest that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats may be particularly beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to better understand the optimal dietary strategies for reducing saturated fat intake and improving cardiovascular outcomes.",

The research, conducted in support of the New Horizons flyby in July 2015, provides valuable insights into the complex interactions occurring in the distant reaches of our solar system.\n\nThe study, led by a team of researchers, involved low-resolution imaging X-ray spectrophotometry of the Pluto system. Observations were carried out in two campaigns - a trial campaign in February 2014 and a follow-up campaign spanning July to August 2015. In a total of 174 kiloseconds of on-target time, the researchers detected 8 photons in the 0.31 \u2013 0.60 keV passband within an 11 x 11 pixel box co-moving with Pluto, confirming the presence of X-ray emissions from the system.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the X-ray emissions from Pluto do not match the spectral shape of the background and are consistent with a 90% flux aperture co-moving with the dwarf planet. The researchers ruled out auroral effects as a source of the emissions, as Pluto lacks a known magnetic field. Instead, they propose that the X-ray emissions could be attributed to charge-exchange interactions between solar wind ions and atmospheric neutrals.\n\nThe study estimated the X-ray power from Pluto to be around 200 megawatts, placing it within the range of X-ray emissions observed from other solar system sources such as auroral precipitation and solar X-ray scattering. The researchers also considered the possibility of nano-scale atmospheric haze particles enhancing the scattering of solar X-rays from Pluto, but the energy signature of the detected photons did not align with this hypothesis.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that the solar wind conditions near Pluto at the time of the X-ray emissions would require a significant focusing and enhancement of minor ions within a close proximity to the dwarf planet. This suggests a complex interplay of factors contributing to the observed X-ray emissions from the Pluto system.\n\nOverall, this groundbreaking study provides a new perspective on the dynamics of the Pluto system and highlights the intricate processes at play in the outer regions of our solar system.

And even after the historic flyby conducted by the\n\nNew Horizons\n\nprobe in\n\nJuly of 2015, many mysteries remain.What's more, ongoing analysis of the NH data has revealed new mysteries. For instance, a\n\nrecent study\n\nby a team of astronomers indicated that a survey by the\n\nChandra X-ray Observatory\n\nrevealed the presence of some rather strong x-rays emissions coming from Pluto.This was unexpected, and is causing scientists to rethink what they thought they knew about Pluto's atmosphere and its interaction with solar wind.In the past, many Solar bodies have been observed emitting x-rays, which were the result of interaction between solar wind and neutral gases (like argon and nitrogen).\nSuch emissions have been detected from planets like Venus and Mars (due to the presence of argon and/or nitrogen in their atmospheres), but also with smaller bodies like comets \u2013 which acquire halos due to outgassing.Ever since the NH probe conducted its flyby of Pluto in 2015, astronomers have been aware that Pluto has an atmosphere which changes size and density with the seasons.Basically, as the planet reaches perihelion during its 248 year orbital period \u2013 a distance of\n\n4,436,820,000 kilometres\n\n(2,756,912,133 miles) from the Sun \u2013 the atmosphere thickens due to the sublimation of frozen nitrogen and methane on the surface.The last time Pluto was at perihelion was on September 5th, 1989, which means that it was still experiencing summer when NH made its flyby.While studying Pluto, the probe detected an atmosphere that was primarily composed of nitrogen gas (N\u00b2) along with methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO\u00b2).\nAstronomers therefore decided to look for signs of x-ray emissions coming from Pluto's atmosphere using the Chandra X-ray Observatory.Prior to the NH mission's flyby, most models of Pluto's atmosphere expected it to be quite extended. However, the probe found that the atmosphere was less extended and that its rate of loss was hundreds of times lower than what these models predicted.Therefore, as the team indicated in\n\ntheir study, they expected to find x-ray emissions that were consistent with what the NH flyby observed:\"Given that most pre-encounter models of Pluto's atmosphere had predicted it to be much more extended, with an estimated loss rate to space of ~1027\n\nto 1028\n\nmol/sec of N\u00b2 and CH4\u2026 we attempted to detect X-ray emission created by [solar wind] neutral gas charge exchange interactions in the low density neutral gas surrounding Pluto,\" they wrot",

The study, conducted using satellite thermal-band data under clear-sky conditions, reveals the presence of ultra-cold temperatures in small topographic basins above 3,800 meters elevation.\n\nThe research team, spanning multiple institutions, discovered approximately 100 sites where minimum surface temperatures of around -98\u00b0C were recorded between 2004 and 2016.

The occurrence of these ultralow temperatures was found to be closely linked to the strong circulation of the polar vortex.\n\nThe study proposes a conceptual model of radiative surface cooling that leads to the formation of an extreme inversion layer, contributing to the further cooling of the surface.

Understanding these processes is crucial for advancing our knowledge of Antarctic climate dynamics and their potential implications for the broader climate system.\n\nThe research not only expands our understanding of extreme cold environments but also underscores the importance of continued monitoring and research efforts to unravel the mysteries of Antarctica's unique and dynamic climate system.",

Agreeableness is one of the five chief measures tested under the system, with the other four being extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience.\nBut more importantly than the behavioural data - which have been the focus of many other studies - the MRI results actually demonstrated neurological differences in the participants' grey matter volume (GMV) as a result of their upbringing.In particular, the results showed that only children showed greater supramarginal gyrus volumes - a portion of the parietal lobe thought to be associated with language perception and processing, and which in the study correlated to the only children's greater flexibility.By contrast, the brains of only children revealed less volume in other areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) - associated with emotional regulation, such as personality and social behaviours - which the team found to be correlated with their lower scores on agreeableness.While the researchers aren't drawing firm conclusions on why only children exhibit these differences, they suggest it's possible that parents may foster greater creativity in only children by devoting more time to them - and possibly placing greater expectations on the",

The study, led by researchers from an undisclosed institution, revealed several key findings that provide insight into the factors contributing to the rise of narcissism in China.\n\nThe study found that younger individuals tend to exhibit higher levels of narcissism compared to older individuals. This suggests a generational difference in self-perception and behavior, with younger individuals potentially being more focused on themselves and their own achievements.\n\nFurthermore, the research indicated that individuals from higher socioeconomic classes displayed higher levels of narcissism than those from lower socioeconomic classes. This finding highlights the role of social status and economic background in shaping an individual's self-concept and behavior.\n\nAnother interesting discovery was that individuals from only-child families exhibited higher levels of narcissism compared to those from families with multiple children. This finding suggests that family structure and dynamics may play a role in the development of narcissistic traits in individuals.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed that individuals from urban areas tended to display higher levels of narcissism than those from rural areas. This finding points to the influence of urbanization and modernization on shaping self-concept and values in Chinese society.\n\nLastly, the researchers found that individualistic values were predictive of individual differences in narcissism. This suggests that cultural values and beliefs play a significant role in shaping narcissistic tendencies in individuals.\n\nOverall, the findings of the study suggest that sociocultural changes in China are contributing to the rise of narcissism in the country. The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding the influence of sociodemographic factors on self-concept and narcissism levels in order to address and potentially mitigate the negative consequences of excessive narcissism in society.\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between sociodemographic factors and narcissism in China, highlighting the need for further research and interventions to promote healthy self-perception and interpersonal relationships in the country.",

When tested in the lab, it \"significantly\" delayed ice formation when compared with a regular road surface, they report, while at the same time remaining just as sturdy as unmodified bitumen.According to the American Chemical Society, the new composite was able to release de-icing salt over a period of two months, but the effects could last even longer when used on real roads. With the salt-polymer composite spread out evenly through the asphalt, the pressure of cars and trucks wearing away the road would slowly release the mixture and keep the surface ice-free - perhaps even for several years at a time.Of course, it wouldn't just be drivers who would benefit. Local authorities have to spend money and use up other resources clearing roads during the winter, not just once, but time and time again if the conditions persist.

The research, led by a team of scientists, focused on addressing the limitations of conventional ionic salts by incorporating hydrophilic salts into a hydrophobic asphalt binder for controlled release of anti-icing molecules.\n\nTraditional anti-icing agents, such as salts, are commonly used to prevent ice accumulation on asphalt surfaces. However, these salts are easily washed away by rain or vehicles, necessitating frequent reapplication and posing environmental concerns due to their negative impact on living organisms and ecosystems. Furthermore, these agents can compromise the mechanical properties of asphalt, leading to durability issues.\n\nIn this study, the researchers developed a functional polymer composite consisting of potassium formate (HCOOK) salt pockets dissolved in a hydrophilic gel medium and dispersed in a hydrophobic styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer matrix. By incorporating this composite into bitumen, the team aimed to enhance the anti-icing properties of asphalt while maintaining its structural integrity.\n\nThrough a series of experiments, the researchers successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the polymer composite-modified bitumen in delaying freezing compared to traditional bitumen. The modified bitumen exhibited a significant increase in freezing delay in a controlled chamber environment, showcasing its potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios.\n\nMoreover, the study investigated the release of HCOOK salt from the polymer composite-modified bitumen over time, revealing a controlled release within a specific range depending on the composite content.

        "a": "Heroic Scandinavian women standing shoulder to shoulder with ranks of masculine warriors in Viking combat are the stuff of legends, but debate has raged over the years on whether it's also the stuff of reality.\nA new discovery has confirmed that in at least one specific case, remains found buried in a warrior's grave were genetically female, supporting the view that the mythical 'shield-maiden' female fighters might have its roots in actual historical events.Researchers from Uppsala University and Stockholm University conducted genetic and isotope analyses on bones taken from a 10th century grave near the Swedish Viking\n\ntown of Birka, just outside of Stockholm.The grave, coded Bj 581, consisted of no ordinary burial. Excavated and mapped well over a century ago, it was found to contain an axe, sword, spear, armour-piercing arrows, a battle knife, a pair of shields, pieces for a table-top war game, and the bones of a mare and a stallion.Illustration by Evald Hansen based on the original plan by excavator Hjalmar Stolpe (1889).Based on these goods, and the fact most such high ranking warriors of the period were considered to be men, the skeleton was readily assumed to belong to a male.\nBut the bones didn't seem all that masculine, and a full osteological inspection of Bj 581's skeleton suggested the esteemed official was in fact a woman of at least 30 years in age.The size and shapes of bones can provide a strong suggestion on the specific sex of a set of remains, but variation within sexes and between populations means it's not without its problems.DNA can provide a more solid grounding for a conclusion, when it can be successfully extracted.In this case, the researchers amplified DNA taken from one of the Birka warrior's teeth and arm bones and determined there was sufficient genetic data to conclude it was of only X chromosome origin, without any sign of DNA from a Y chromosome. \"This is the first formal and genetic confirmation of a female Viking warrior,\" says researcher Mattias Jakobsson from Uppsala University.\nAn evaluation of the isotopes in her bones showed she was well travelled, adding further evidence to her being a respected leader among her people.\"The gaming set indicates that she was an officer, someone who worked with tactics and strategy and could lead troops in battle,\" says lead researcher Charlotte Hedenstierna-Jonson from Stockholm University. Ancient Scandinavian legends, or sagas as they're often called, often contain depictions of female fighters.One of the more well known, The Saga of Herv\u00f6r and Heidrek from the 13th century, features a heroic female fighter who took on her father's quest to find a mythical sword named Tyrfing.Such powerful tales have resonated through the ages, influencing numerous writers and poets, the most renowned of which being Lord of the Rings author, JRR Tolkien.\nSeparating myth from historical accounts has required a lot of detective work, however. And even with this discovery, it's important not to get too worked up in the romance.\"What we have studied was not a Valkyrie from the sagas but a real life military leader, that happens to have been a woman,\" says Hedenstierna-Jonson, referring to mythical warrior spirits who oversee battles in ancient stories.A study published in 2011 based on osteology (the physiological study of bones) claimed women made up as much as half of the remains among Norse migrants, a report that sparked an enthusiastic, if somewhat overhyped interpretation that envisioned this Viking diaspora as armed raiders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, while one discovery can't tell us how common female combatants are, having DNA evidence confirming at least one instance of a prominent warrior-class woman is a sign that the stories weren't all fantasy.\"Written sources mention female warriors occasionally, but this is the first time that we've really found convincing archaeological evidence for their existence,\" says researcher Neil Price from Uppsala University.\n\nThis research was published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropolog",

However, the new study's findings paint a different picture, indicating that female migration may have been just as significant as male migration. The analysis of burials that are definitively Norse and have been sexed osteologically revealed a more balanced representation of Norse women in the region.\n\nThe research suggests that Norse women were present in eastern England from the earliest stages of the migration, including during the campaigning period that began in 865. This challenges previous assumptions that Norse women were not actively involved in the migration process or were only present in small numbers.\n\nDr. Emma Smith, lead researcher on the study, commented on the significance of these findings, stating, \"Our research highlights the importance of considering all available evidence when reconstructing historical narratives.

        "a": "This article was written by Jane Chalmers from Western Sydney University and was originally published by The Conversation.It is perhaps one of the most controversial debates in sexual function: is there or isn't there a G-spot? And if there is, how do we find it?\nThe G-spot is a purported highly erogenous area of the vagina that, when stimulated, may lead to strong sexual arousal and orgasm. Although the concept of vaginal orgasms has been around since the 17th century, the term G-spot wasn't coined until the 1980s. The G-spot is named after Eric Grafenberg, a German gynaecologist, whose 1940s research documented this sensitive region within the vagina in some women.The controversy surrounding the G-spot comes about because there is no consensus over just what the G-spot is, and while some women can orgasm through stimulation of the G-spot, others find it incredibly uncomfortable.Where is the G-spot?The G-spot lies on the anterior wall of the vagina, about 5 to 8 cm above the opening to the vagina. It is easiest to locate if a woman lies on her back and has someone else insert one or two fingers into the vagina with the palm up. Using a 'come here' motion, the tissue surrounding the urethra, called the urethral sponge, will begin to swell.\nThis swelling area is the G-spot. At first, this touch may make the woman feel as though she needs to urinate, but after a few seconds may turn into a pleasurable sensation. For some women, however, this stimulation remains uncomfortable, no matter how long the stimulation continues.Allure MedicThe G-spot orgasm and female ejaculationPhysiological responses from a G-spot orgasm differ to those responses seen in clitoral orgasms. During clitoral orgasms, the end of the vagina (near the opening) balloons out; however, in G-spot orgasms, the cervix pushes down into the vagina.Up to 50 percent of women expel various kinds of fluid from their urethra during sexual arousal or sexual intercourse. Studies have shown there are generally three types of fluid that are produced: urine, a dilute form of urine (known as 'squirting'), and female ejaculate.\nWhile some women may expel these fluids during arousal or sex, they are most commonly expelled during orgasm, and particularly through G-spot orgasm. So what is the difference between these fluids?The release of urine during penetrative sex is usually as a result of stress urinary incontinence. Some women experience no other symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, such as leakage when sneezing, coughing, or laughing, but will leak during sex.'Squirting' is the leakage of a urine-like substance during orgasm. It is thought to occur because of strong muscle contractions surrounding the bladder during female orgasm.Female ejaculate, most commonly reported with G-spot orgasm, is a much different substance: women describe the fluid as looking like watered-down fat-free milk and report producing about a teaspoon in volume during orgasm. The contents of female ejaculate have been chemically analysed and found that it closely resembles secretions from the male prostate. This has led to many suspecting that glands known as the female prostate (formerly Skene's glands) produce this ejaculate.\nWhat could the G-spot be?The G-spot is not a single, distinct entity. Much debate exists in the research field as to just what the G-spot is, and how it can produce orgasm.The G-spot is located in the clitourethrovaginal complex \u2013 the area where the clitoris, urethra, and vagina all meet up. There are several structures in this complex that could produce pleasurable sensations when stimulated \u2013 the G-spot might reflect the stimulation of just one structure, or multiple structures at once. Two structures in particular have been hotly debated and stand out as likely candidates for producing G-spot orgasms: the female prostate and the clitoris.The female prostate lies within the urethral sponge, a cushion of tissue surrounding the urethra. The urethral sponge and female prostate are highly innervated, which may explain their sensitivity when stimulated.\nThe clitoris is more than meets the eye: we now know this organ extends far beyond what is visible externally. Apart from where the urethra and vagina touch, the clitoris somewhat encircles the urethra. Mechanical stimulation of the G-spot may in fact be stimulating the internal portion of the clitoris.So, is the G-spot fact or fiction?The G-spot certainly exists in some women. However, not all women will find the stimulation of the G-spot pleasurable.Just because a woman is not aroused when the G-area is stimulated, this does not mean she is in any way sexually dysfunctional. Sexuality and arousal have clear physiological and psychological links. But, as human beings, we are all made slightly anatomically and physiologically different.In the same way that what I consider 'blue' may not be the exact same 'blue' you perceive, an orgasm in one woman is not the same as an orgasm in any other woman. It is a unique experience. And although you and I both see blue through our eyes, the complexities of human sexuality and the female reproductive organs mean women may achieve orgasm in multiple ways.\nSome women are unable to orgasm in the presence of a partner, but have no difficulty with orgasm with masturbation. Some women can orgasm only with clitoral stimulation, while others can orgasm through vaginal stimulation alone. There are reports of women who experience orgasm through the stimulation of the foot, and Grafenberg detailed in his report women who experienced arousal through ear penile penetration (but these reports are yet to be replicated!).You are not abnormal or strange or dysfunctional if you cannot find your G-spot. Similarly, you are not abnormal or strange or dysfunctional if you expel fluid during arousal or sex. Sexual arousal, desire, and pleasure are individual: if you are unable to find your G-area, work on finding something that does fulfil your sexual needs.Harry Potter star, feminist, and all-round superstar Emma Watson supports a great website for women wanting to explore their sexuality further.

The patient presented with complaints of undesired orgasmic sensations emanating from her foot, prompting a series of comprehensive examinations and tests to unravel the underlying mechanisms of this peculiar phenomenon.\n\nVarious diagnostic procedures were employed, including in-depth interviews, physical examinations, sensory testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and blockade of the left S1 dorsal root ganglion. The results of these tests revealed subtle abnormalities in sensory amplitudes in specific nerve tracts of the left foot, suggesting a potential neurological basis for the foot-induced orgasmic sensations.\n\nRemarkably, the application of TENS at specific points on the left foot and vagina elicited instant orgasmic sensations that radiated between the two regions, indicating a complex interplay of neural pathways involved in the manifestation of FOS. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions, including the blockade of the left S1 dorsal root ganglion with local anesthetics and pulsed radiofrequency treatment, resulted in a significant alleviation and eventual disappearance of the foot-induced orgasmic sensations.\n\nThe researchers postulate that the development of FOS in this particular case may have been triggered by partial nerve regeneration following a previous medical emergency, leading to a misinterpretation of afferent sensory information from the foot and vagina at the spinal level. This misinterpretation by the brain could explain the phenomenon of orgasmic sensations being perceived solely as originating from the foot, highlighting the intricate and interconnected nature of neural processing in the human body.\n\nThe identification and successful management of Foot Orgasm Syndrome in this case shed light on a rare and intriguing neurological condition, expanding our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying sexual sensations and their neural correlates. This unprecedented case opens up new avenues for further research into the intricacies of sensory processing and the potential for unique manifestations of sexual experiences in the human body.",

        "a": "This article was written by Giuliana Mazzoni from the University of Hull in the UK, and was originally published by The Conversation.Urging a depressed person to stay positive by remembering the good things in life is unlikely to be helpful advice. That is because depression blocks access to happy memories. But what if we could somehow artificially recreate such memories to allow for some more positive thinking? A study suggests that this is indeed possible - at least in rats.\nSurprisingly, the psychology and physiology of rodents is not so distant from our own. And if the same effect could be observed in humans, it might help open depressed individuals up to positive general interpretation of life experiences that make it possible to lift the dark veil of depression.The brain and depressionClinical depression, which is different from a temporary bout of sadness, is a rather common psychopathological disorder characterised by persistent negative moods, feelings of sadness, loss of interest and motivation. It has negative consequences on sleep and affects many aspects of an individual's life, including what would otherwise be rewarding behaviours - like eating.In humans it affects both adults and children, but general behaviour consistent with depression can be observed in animals. This has limits of course. For example, human depression is characterised by hopelessness and suicidal thoughts, which cannot be detected in animals. However, loss of interest is present in both. In rodents, more specifically, loss of interest can be easily detected by measuring sucrose preference - depressed animals lose interest in sugar.\nAnimal models for depression are extremely helpful in trying to understand biological, physiological and genetic bases of this pathology. The new research does shows that the artificial reactivation of brain cells spontaneously active during positive experiences, substantially decreases depression (anhaedonia) in rats.\n\nA cross-section of a positive memory. Seen here is the hippocampus; the brain cells glowing in red were previously active during the encoding of a positive memory. Credit: Steve Ramirez The researchers used a method called optogenetics, in which specific brain cells are genetically sensitised to light and then activated using pulses of light, in the experiment. Light-sensitive molecules were in this way used to detect which brain cells were activated by a certain experience in the animals. The area of the brain chosen by the researchers to be tagged by these molecules is the hippocampus, more specifically a subarea of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus. This is linked to the formation of memories and to responses of avoidance and of appetite, and thus records positive and negative experiences.\nThe researchers first induced anhaedonia in male rodents by exposing them to repeated stress by making it impossible for them to move, such as hanging them by the tail. They then exposed them to three types of experiences: positive (being put in a cage with a female), negative (being immobilised in a cage) or neutral (being put in an empty cage) and recorded which brain cells were active during these experiences.Lori Leaumont/FlickrThe researchers then used pulses of light to activate the cells they had pinpointed. They found that only the reactivation of cells in the dentate gyrus that were active during positive experiences (but not the reactivation of those active during negative or neutral experiences) made rats show interest in sugar again, meaning they had been relieved from depression.\nNext stepsWhat's so interesting about this, particularly for a memory researcher, is that it was the artificial reactivation of the cells (the reactivation of the positive memories) and not re-exposure to these positive experiences that did the trick.In other words, being put again in a cage with a female did not lift the rats from depression. One can speculate that being put again in a cage with a female does not necessarily reactivate a memory, as it can be encoded as a new experience. It seems, then, that it is the reactivation of the neural network linked with a positive past experience, and not the positive experience in itself, that helps.But can these results be extended to humans as they are? Not immediately, of course. However there is hope, as for example clinical studies have shown that therapeutic cognitive-behavioral interventions using positive mental imagery or the restructuring of how past experiences are interpreted, might be of help. The link between personal memories and depression is also currently experimentally investigate",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals How Autobiographical Memory Biases Influence Depression Risk\n\nIn a recent study published in a scientific journal, researchers have shed light on how autobiographical memory biases can serve as cognitive vulnerability factors for depression. The study, conducted with a non-clinical college sample, focused on the role of autobiographical memory performance in moderating the relationship between life stress and depression.\n\nThe research findings suggest that individuals with an increased propensity towards categoric recall, where memories are grouped into categories rather than specific details, are more likely to experience future depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, this vulnerability factor was found to be independent of the presence of high levels of life stress, indicating that categoric recall alone can contribute to depression risk.\n\nOn the other hand, reduced autobiographical memory specificity, where individuals struggle to recall specific details of past events, did not emerge as a standalone vulnerability factor for depression. However, it was identified as a moderator of the relationship between chronic daily hassles and depression. This suggests that while reduced memory specificity may not directly lead to depression, it can exacerbate the impact of daily stressors on mental health.\n\nThese findings underscore the importance of both categoric recall propensity and reduced memory specificity as potential vulnerability factors for future depressive symptoms. By understanding how autobiographical memory biases influence depression risk, researchers hope to develop targeted interventions to help individuals better cope with stress and prevent the onset of depression.\n\nThe study's results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between memory processes and mental health, offering new avenues for research and potential strategies for early intervention in individuals at risk of depression.",

        "a": "Title: New Theory Expands Understanding of Opinion Influence Processes in Social Groups\n\nIn a recent scientific paper, researchers have presented a further development of a previously published theory that sheds light on opinion influence processes in social groups. This new development not only extends the existing theory to encompass other areas beyond opinion formation but also explores how social comparison plays a crucial role in the appraisal and evaluation of abilities as well as opinions.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of social psychologists, challenges the notion of \"plausibility\" in theories and hypotheses within the field. While many theories are often judged based on how well they align with common sense or intuition, the researchers found that their expanded theory may not fit the traditional definition of plausibility. However, despite this discrepancy, the theory has shown promise in explaining a significant amount of data and has led to testable predictions.\n\nTo validate their expanded theory, the researchers designed three experiments specifically tailored to test the predictions derived from the new framework. The results of these experiments, which have now been completed, have provided strong corroboration for the theory's predictions.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as it not only enhances our understanding of opinion influence processes in social groups but also opens up new avenues for exploring the role of social comparison in various aspects of human behavior. By delving deeper into how individuals evaluate abilities and opinions within social contexts, this study offers valuable insights that could have far-reaching implications in the field of social psychology.\n\nAs the researchers continue to develop and refine their theory based on the relevant data gathered from these experiments, the scientific community eagerly anticipates further advancements in our understanding of social dynamics and group behavior.",
        "b": "I'm sitting on a train when a group of football fans streams on. Fresh from the game \u2013 their team has clearly won \u2013 they occupy the empty seats around me.One picks up a discarded newspaper and chuckles derisively as she reads about the latest \"alternative facts\" peddled by Donald Trump.\nThe others soon chip in with their thoughts on the US president's fondness for conspiracy theories. The chatter quickly turns to other conspiracies and I enjoy eavesdropping while the group brutally mock flat Earthers, chemtrails memes and Gwyneth Paltrow's latest idea.Then there's a lull in the conversation, and someone takes it as an opportunity to pipe in with: \"That stuff might be nonsense, but don't try and tell me you can trust everything the mainstream feeds us! Take the moon landings, they were obviously faked and not even very well. I read this blog the other day that pointed out there aren't even stars in any of the pictures!\"To my amazement the group joins in with other \"evidence\" supporting the moon landing hoax: inconsistent shadows in photographs, a fluttering flag when there's no atmosphere on the moon, how Neil Armstrong was filmed walking on to the surface when no-one was there to hold the camera.A minute ago they seemed like rational people capable of assessing evidence and coming to a logical conclusion. But now things are taking a turn down crackpot alley. So I take a deep breath and decide to chip in.\n\"Actually all that can be explained quite easily \u2026 \"They turn to me aghast that a stranger would dare to butt into their conversation. I continue undeterred, hitting them with a barrage of facts and rational explanations.\"The flag didn't flutter in the wind, it just moved as Buzz Aldrin planted it! Photos were taken during lunar daytime \u2013 and obviously you can't see the stars during the day. The weird shadows are because of the very wide-angle lenses they used which distort the photos.\"And nobody took the footage of Neil descending the ladder. There was a camera mounted on the outside of the lunar module which filmed him making his giant leap. If that isn't enough then the final clinching proof comes from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's photos of the landing sites where you can clearly see the tracks that the astronauts made as they wandered around the surface.\n\"Nailed it!\" I think to myself.But it appears my listeners are far from convinced. They turn on me, producing more and more ridiculous claims. Stanley Kubrick filmed the lot, key personnel have died in mysterious ways, and so on \u2026The train pulls up in a station, it isn't my stop but I take the opportunity to make an exit anyway. As I sheepishly mind the gap I wonder why my facts failed so badly to change their minds.The simple answer is that facts and rational arguments really aren't very good at altering people's beliefs.\n\nThat's because our rational brains are fitted with not-so-evolved evolutionary hard wiring.One of the reasons why conspiracy theories spring up with such regularity is due to our desire to impose structure on the world and incredible ability to recognise patterns.\nIndeed, a recent study showed a correlation between an individual's need for structure and tendency to believe in a conspiracy theory.Take this sequence for example:0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1Can you see a pattern? Quite possibly \u2013 and you aren't alone. A quick twitter poll (replicating a much more rigourous study) suggested that 56 percent of people agree with you \u2013 even though the sequence was generated by me flipping a coin.It seems our need for structure and our pattern recognition skill can be rather overactive, causing a tendency to spot patterns \u2013 like constellations, clouds that looks like dogs and vaccines causing autism \u2013 where in fact there are none.Can you see what I see? prapann/Shutterstock The ability to see patterns was probably a useful survival trait for our ancestors \u2013 better to mistakenly spot signs of a predator than to overlook a real big hungry cat.\nBut plonk the same tendency in our information rich world and we see nonexistent links between cause and effect \u2013 conspiracy theories \u2013 all over the place.Peer pressureAnother reason we are so keen to believe in conspiracy theories is that we are social animals and our status in that society is much more important (from an evolutionary standpoint) than being right.Consequently we constantly compare our actions and beliefs to those of our peers, and then alter them to fit in. This means that if our social group believes something, we are more likely to follow the herd.This effect of social influence on behaviour was nicely demonstrated back in 1961 by the street corner experiment, conducted by the US social psychologist Stanley Milgram (better known for his work on obedience to authority figures) and colleagues.\nThe experiment was simple (and fun) enough for you to replicate. Just pick a busy street corner and stare at the sky for 60 seconds.Most likely very few folks will stop and check what you are looking at \u2013 in this situation Milgram found that about 4 percent of the passersby joined in. Now get some friends to join you with your lofty observations.As the group grows, more and more strangers will stop and stare aloft. By the time the group has grown to 15 sky gazers, about 40 percent of the by-passers will have stopped and craned their necks along with you.You have almost certainly seen the same effect in action at markets where you find yourself drawn to the stand with the crowd around it.The principle applies just as powerfully to ideas. If more people believe a piece of information, then we are more likely to accept it as true. And so if, via our social group, we are overly exposed to a particular idea then it becomes embedded in our world view.In short,\n\nsocial proof is a much more effective persuasion technique than purely evidence-based proof, which is of course why this sort of proof is so popular in advertising (\"80 percent of mums agree\").Social proof is just one of a host of logical fallacies that also cause us to overlook evidence. A related issue is the ever-present confirmation bias, that tendency for folks to seek out and believe the data that supports their views while discounting the stuff that doesn't.We all suffer from this. Just think back to the last time you heard a debate on the radio or television. How convincing did you find the argument that ran counter to your view compared to the one that agreed with it?The chances are that, whatever the rationality of either side, you largely dismissed the opposition arguments while applauding those who agreed with you.Confirmation bias also manifests as a tendency to select information from sources that already agree with our views (which probably comes from the social group that we relate too).Hence your political beliefs probably dictate your preferred news outlets.The difference. Of course there is a belief system that recognises logical fallacies such as confirmation bias and tries to iron them out.Science, through repetition of observations, turns anecdote into data, reduces confirmation bias and accepts that theories can be updated in the face of evidence. That means that it is open to correcting its core texts.Nevertheless, confirmation bias plagues us all. Star physicist Richard Feynman famously described an example of it that cropped up in one of the most rigorous areas of sciences, particle physics.\n\"Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.",

Until you gently snap their tail, at least.\nNew research has literally shed a light on the drops' odd balance of incredible strength and fragility, revealing it all comes down to a thin skin of glass held under incredible tension.A team of researchers led by scientists from the US and UK used a beam of polarised light to measure the internal properties of the glass drops to show how a tough outer skin and the channelling of cracks make for a paradoxical object that is as tough as it is brittle.Prince Rupert's drops are relatively simple to make; they're little more than molten glass dropped into cold water, creating a solid blob with a long, thin tail.Smacking the fat end with a hammer, pressing it with up to\n\n20 tons of force, or even shooting it\n\nwith a gun\n\nwon't do it a lot of damage.To break it, however, you only need to tap its tail, which will cause the entire object to disintegrate into a shower of tiny shards.\nThere aren't any records on the drops' origins, but sometime around 1660 Prince Rupert of the Rhine reportedly gave a number of 'glass bubbles' to King Charles II of England as gifts, who passed them on to the Royal Society of London to conduct a few studies of their own.The drops' remarkable properties were put down to the rapid cooling of the outer surface of the glass, forming a hard shell that allowed the insides to cool and then contract a little slower.It was this difference in layers \u2013 the 'squeezing' (or compressive forces) of the outer layer and the 'pulling' (or tensile forces) of the core \u2013 that was thought to explain both its toughness and fragile tail.New toys in the laboratory have allowed physicists over time to find new ways to test Prince Rupert's drops, and in 1994 materials scientists Srinivasan Chandrasekar from Purdue University and M. Munawar Chaudhri from the University of Cambridge in the UK did what any of us would do with a high speed camera and a glass object \u2013 watch it shatter.\nTheir research added more detail to the traditional explanation \u2013 breaking the tail appears to send a line of cracks running down the length of the drop at speeds of up to 1,900 m/s (6,200ft/s), with the crack-front slowing down as it enters the surface layer.They also measured the toughness and size of the surface layer, finding it extended about 15 percent of the way into their experiment's drops and had a compressive stress of 90 to 170 MPa (about 13,000 to 25,000 psi).In this latest experiment, the researchers put the drop under a different set of tests and recalculated their previous estimates, discovering in the process that the secret to Prince Rupert's drop lies in more than just the toughness of its extraordinary skin.This time the scientists lowered a drop into a liquid with the same refractive index as the glass.\nShining a polarised beam of red light through the liquid and the drop caused the light's rays to distort slightly inside the glass, revealing even more details about its characteristics.The process showed much higher compressive stresses in the surface of the glass drops, of\n\naround 525 MPa (76,000 psi) in the head and a whopping 700 MPa (102,000 psi) in the tail.They also determined the surface layer to be about 10 percent of the diameter of the drop's head.This high compressive stress in the thin outer layer of the glass drops goes some way to explain why they can withstand such enormous forces, however there's one more piece of the puzzle.Based on their past experiments and their investigation using polarised light, the team found that any cracks that did form in the surface layer tended to run parallel to the core.\n\"In order for a PRD [Prince Rupert's drop] to disintegrate catastrophically, it is necessary for any cracks, induced by the compression process, to enter the tension zone in the head of the PRD,\" the researchers explained in their report.That's why they're so easy to break at the tail end. Once a crack gets through the compressed skin into the zone that's held under tension, it's game over.If only the curious mob of Royal Society scholars had such fancy equipment sitting around 400 years ago, they might have nailed the secrets behind Prince Rupert's Drops much sooner.\"I believe we have now solved most of the main aspects of this area. However, new questions may emerge unexpectedly,\" Chaudhri told Lisa Zyga at Phys.org.Let's hope so \u2013 future scientists could use an excuse to break a few glass baubles themselves",
        "b": "Title: The Science Behind Prince Rupert's Drops: Unraveling the Mystery of Their Strength and Fragility\n\nIn a fascinating study published in a scientific journal, researchers have delved into the centuries-old mystery of Prince Rupert's Drops (PRDs), also known as Batavian tears, shedding light on the unique properties that make them both incredibly strong and surprisingly fragile.\n\nPRDs have been around since the early 17th century and are made of a silicate glass with a high thermal expansion coefficient, taking on the shape of a tadpole with a head diameter ranging from 5 to 15mm and a tail diameter of 0.5 to 3.0mm. Despite their delicate appearance, the head of a PRD can withstand impact from a small hammer or compression between tungsten carbide platens to high loads of approximately 15000N, showcasing exceptional strength properties. However, the tail of a PRD can be easily broken with just finger pressure, leading to the catastrophic disintegration of the drop.\n\nThe study reveals that the high strength of PRDs stems from large surface compressive stresses in the range of 400\u2013700MPa, as determined using integrated photoelasticity techniques. These surface compressive stresses play a crucial role in suppressing Hertzian cone cracking during impacts with a small hammer or compression between platens, contributing to the resilience of the drops.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers argue that when the compressive force on a PRD reaches a very high level, plasticity occurs within the drop, ultimately leading to its destruction as the load increases. This finding provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the strength and fragility of PRDs, offering a deeper understanding of their unique properties.\n\nBy unraveling the science behind Prince Rupert's Drops, this study not only enriches our knowledge of these enigmatic glass structures but also highlights the intricate interplay between strength, stress, and fragility in materials. The research opens up new avenues for exploring the mechanical behavior of glass structures and could have implications for the development of stronger and more resilient materials in the future.",

Dismissing it as a sign of mental illness also tells us little about how such beliefs develop in otherwise healthy brains.\nTo gain an understanding of the neurological underpinnings of psychic prediction, the researchers made use of a test that had previously demonstrated a link between the timing of a colour changing shape, and the subject's judgement of their ability to predict its transformation.Only this time the researchers also evaluated the volunteers' beliefs.Just over 1,000 volunteers were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk program, which is a marketplace for tasks that require significant amounts of human brain power.Each was required to look at five empty squares at random locations on a screen and then predict which one would turn red.Following their guess, they had to record whether their prediction was correct, incorrect, or if they didn't have time to make a guess.The researchers randomly adjusted the timing between the appearance of the squares and the colour change, meaning the volunteers sometimes needed to make a call in just a fraction of a second",

The study indicates that the experience of making a choice can be influenced by subsequent events, a phenomenon referred to as \"postdictive\" influence.\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond decision-making processes, raising questions about the extent to which individuals accurately perceive the role of consciousness in their behavior.

This innovative material, designed for roofing applications, has been shown to be 11\u00b0C cooler than a commercial white cool roof in close proximity.\n\nThe key to the exceptional cooling performance of this new material lies in a combination of specially selected polymers and a silver thin film. This unique blend of materials enables the material to achieve solar reflectance and thermal emittance values close to 100% in the infrared wavelengths ranging from 7.9 to 13 \u03bcm.\n\nTraditionally, achieving cooling below ambient temperatures under intense sunlight has been a challenging task. However, the researchers set out to surpass the thermal performance of existing cool roofs by developing a super-cool roofing material with stringent requirements for solar and infrared wavelengths.\n\nThe study revealed that common metals, with the exception of silver, were unable to provide the necessary level of solar reflectance and thermal emittance required for effective cooling. By incorporating a silver layer beneath a glass or polymer material with low solar absorptance, the researchers were able to achieve significant cooling effects due to high thermal emittance.\n\nTo optimize the cooling performance, the researchers focused on enhancing the material's infrared spectral response within the \"sky window\" range (7.9 \u03bcm < \u03bb < 14 \u03bcm), which is characterized by high absorptance and emission due to the absence of incoming radiation from space. The super-cool surfaces developed in the study demonstrated solar reflectance and sky window absorptance levels close to 100%, ensuring efficient cooling even under intense solar radiation.\n\nBy carefully selecting and layering specific polyesters on a silver base, the researchers successfully created a surface that remained below ambient temperature throughout a hot summer day, even under peak solar intensities of 1060 W m\u22122 and high infrared radiation from the atmosphere.\n\nThis breakthrough in super-cool roofing materials holds great promise for enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing cooling costs in hot climates. The development of materials that can effectively cool structures below ambient temperatures in intense sunlight represents a significant advancement in the field of sustainable building technologies.",
        "b": "Researchers from the Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney (UTS Science) have created a material that can stay cooler than the ambient air temperature, even in the height of Australian summer. And it could help to greatly reduce cooling costs and the environmental impact of air-conditioning.\nThe roofing material is made from stacked polymers on top of a thin silver film, and only absorbs an incredible 3 percent of sunlight. Impressively, it also radiates heat out at specific infrared wavelengths that aren't absorbed by the atmosphere - allowing it to beam the heat directly into space.\"We demonstrate for the first time how to make a roof colder than the air temperature around it, even under the most intense summer conditions,\" one of the lead researchers, Geoff Smith,\n\ntold the press.\n\n\"Roofs heat up by absorbing sunlight, so darker roofs can get very hot. Even white roofs still absorb enough sunlight to warm up by 9 degrees Celsius to 12 degrees Celsius.\"Scientists have been working for years to create increasingly more heat-repellant materials to cover our houses with, but they've struggled to find anything that approaches 100 percent solar reflectance.\n\n\"This new surface, however, stayed 11 degrees or more colder than an existing state-of-the-art white roof nearby,\" Smith added.\n\nInfrared image of the new material (purple) on top of a regular white roof. Credit: UTS ScienceEven better, the materials used to create the demo-roof are already commercially available, and so far seem to be suited to creating basic roofing, which means they could easily be integrated by the construction industry.\nThe team has tested the roof on the top of the UTS Science building in Sydney, which is on a busy road and has no cover from the hot summer sun.\n\nDespite the conditions, they showed that the roof was able to stay significantly colder than the air around it, even in direct summer sunlight and when it became covered with traffic-produced dirt and grime. The results have been published open access in Advanced Science.And while its energy-saving abilities overall haven't been tested as yet, Smith believes that it could substantially help to reduce the environmental costs of cooling.\"Cool roofing reduces the severity of the urban heat island problem in towns and cities and helps eliminate peak power demand problems from the operation of many air conditioners,\" he said.\n\n\"The added feedback benefits from cool roofs are not yet widely appreciated, but recent reports have shown they are substantial. Examples include ventilation with cooler air and higher performance of rooftop air-conditioning installations.\"\n\nWe're pretty excited about a world where our homes are kept cool by their roofs, rather than electricity-guzzling air-conditioners.

        "a": "The warm evenings of summer are prime time for grilling. But this all-American ritual may also raise health risks - particularly if the grill is loaded up with hamburgers and hot dogs.\nWhen cooked at high temperatures or over open flames, according to accumulating evidence, compounds in red and processed meats undergo biochemical reactions that produce carcinogenic compounds capable of altering the eater's DNA.Most of the research has been conducted in lab dishes and in animals. But some emerging evidence is starting to connect the dots to human risks of cancer, too.Lest you feel that science threatens everything you enjoy in life, experts say it's not necessary to give up meat - or grilling - altogether. Grilled vegetables don't harbour the same risks. There are also ways to cook meat that produce fewer carcinogens.And while there's not enough evidence to say how much is too much, eating grilled meat in moderation is probably fine. In other words, don't get too freaked out by what you might find on the Internet.\n\"You can just Google and see all of these sensationalistic headlines that say eating bacon is like smoking a pack of cigarettes,\" but it's not the same, says Robert Turesky, a biochemical toxicologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.\"I still do enjoy barbecue. I just don't eat it as often.\"The case for meat as a cancer risk has been building for decades, with plenty of studies showing that people who report eating diets heavy in red and processed meats have higher risks of certain types of cancer, as well as heart disease and other chronic illnesses.Enough of those studies - together with lab work - have built up to make a convincing case that meat carries risks, according to a 2015\n\nanalysis\n\nby the World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer, which considered more than 800 studies conducted around the world.\nOverall, the IARC review found that the strongest evidence linked processed meats (such as hot dogs, beef jerky, bacon and ham) to colorectal cancer - with each hot-dog-size serving of processed meat eaten daily raising the risk by 18 percent over a lifetime.More than 34,000 cancer deaths are caused around the world each year by diets high in processed meat, according to data referenced in the IARC report.By comparison, tobacco causes about a million cancer deaths annually. Alcohol consumption causes 600,000. And air pollution is responsible for 200,000.The IARC review also found evidence for an association between unprocessed red meat (such as beef or pork) and colorectal cancer, along with some evidence that red meat might contribute to pancreatic and prostate cancers, too.Studies show several ways that meat might cause cancer, says Loic Le Marchand, an epidemiologist at the University of Hawaii Cancer Centre, who collaborated with more than 20 international scientists on the IARC report.\nOne line of evidence points to compounds called nitrates and nitrites, which are used during processing and also form in the colon when people digest meat and meat products, even those labelled 'nitrate-free'.Cooking methods make a difference, according to studies that have zeroed in on two groups of chemicals that appear in particularly large quantities when meat, fish or poultry is cooked under high heat by grilling, barbecuing, broiling or even pan-frying.One group, called HAAs (heterocyclic aromatic amines), form during high-temperature reactions between substances in muscle tissue. PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), which form when meat is smoked, charred or cooked over an open flame, are also found in tobacco smoke.In general, Turesky says, higher temperatures and longer cooking times lead to higher levels of HAAs and PAHs.\nEnzymes in our bodies then change these chemicals into compounds that can damage DNA. Numerous studies have illustrated that kind of damaging potential in cell cultures and animals, including rodents and primates.But does meat actually cause cancer in people?Turesky is beginning to turn up evidence that it might. In a\n\nstudy\n\npublished last year, he and colleagues studied biopsies of prostate tumours and found that DNA in the cancer cells had been damaged by HAAs.\"This is the first unequivocal proof that, once you eat the cooked meat mutagens, some of them find their way to the prostate and damage the prostate,\" Turesky says.The study doesn't prove that meat caused the cancer, he adds. \"It could just be an association. Now we have to show that the mutations are attributed to the chemicals in cooked meat.",
        "b": "**New Study Identifies DNA Adducts Linking Well-Done Cooked Meats to Prostate Cancer Risk**\n\nA groundbreaking new study has shed light on the potential link between frequent consumption of well-done cooked meats and an increased risk of prostate cancer. While previous epidemiologic studies have suggested a connection between the two, the lack of clear physiochemical markers of DNA damage from carcinogens derived from cooked meats has been a significant gap in understanding this association.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of researchers, has developed a highly sensitive nano-LC-Orbitrap MSn method to measure DNA adducts of several carcinogens found in well-done cooked meats, tobacco smoke, and environmental pollution. These carcinogens include compounds such as 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (A\u03b1C), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP).\n\nThe researchers were able to detect the DNA adduct of PhIP, known as N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-PhIP (dG-C8-PhIP), in 11 out of 35 patient samples, with levels ranging from 2 to 120 adducts per 10^9 nucleotides. However, the adducts of A\u03b1C, MeIQx, and B[a]P were not detected in any specimens, while N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP (dG-C8-4-ABP) was identified in one subject at a level of 30 adducts per 10^9 nucleotides.\n\nThe study also found that PhIP-DNA adducts could be quantitatively recovered from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, indicating that FFPE tissues can serve as biospecimens for carcinogen DNA adduct biomarker research.\n\nThese findings provide crucial support to the existing epidemiological observations implicating PhIP, one of the most mass-abundant heterocyclic aromatic amines formed in well-done cooked meats, as a DNA-damaging agent that may contribute to the development of prostate cancer.\n\nThe identification of specific DNA adducts associated with carcinogens from well-done cooked meats represents a significant step forward in understanding the potential mechanisms underlying the increased prostate cancer risk associated with the consumption of these foods. Further research in this area could lead to the development of targeted interventions to reduce the impact of these carcinogens on prostate cancer risk.",

        "a": "Back in February, physicists announced an outlandish plan to 're-freeze' the Arctic, by installing 10 million wind-powered pumps over the ice cap to replenish the dwindling sea ice.\nThe idea was so wild, no one actually thought it would happen, but researchers in Switzerland have just launched a trial that will see if they can sustain an entire glacier through summer using nothing but snow machines.If the team manages to successfully preserve a small, artificial glacier at the foot of the Diavolezzafirn glacier in the south-eastern part of Switzerland through the year's hottest months, it's hoped that they can apply the technique to the country's natural giant - the\n\nMorteratsch glacier.One of the most massive glaciers in the eastern alps, this vast valley glacier has been retreating fast thanks to rising temperatures, and is currently losing 30 to 40 metres every year.It could be that the only hope for Switzerland's Morteratsch glacier is thousands of snow machines blasting it with artificial sleet.\nIf all of this sounds a little far-fetched to you, scientists have actually done the maths,\n\nand it is technically feasible to use machines to rebuild glaciers and replenish vanishing sea ice.Earlier this year, a team led by Arizona State University physicist, Steven Desch, put out a report describing how millions of wind-powered pumps could blast 1.3 metres of water on the surface of the Arctic, adding 1 extra metre (3.2 feet) of sea ice.\n\nWhile an extra metre doesn't sound like all that much, they calculated that it would be like pushing time back by 17 years.The only problem? How mind-bogglingly vast the Arctic region actually is.\n\nThe team calculated that covering just 10 percent of the Arctic would involve erecting millions of pumps, which together would have to spray 7.5 kg per of water (16.5 pounds) every second to achieve 1 extra metre in a year.\n\"The area of the Arctic Ocean is about 107\n\nkm2 [3.8 million miles2],\" the report stated.\"If the wind-powered pumps are to be distributed across 10 percent of that area, this would necessitate about 10 million wind-powered pumps; if distributed across the entire Arctic, about 100 million would be needed.\"In order to build a fleet of 100 million pumps to save the entire Arctic, you'd need more steel than the US produces in a entire year.All that considered, there was no way in hell the plan was ever going to be funded, but the much smaller version proposed for Switzerland could actually have some legs.Glacier expert Johannes Oerlemans of Utrecht University in the Netherlands calculated that around 4,000 snow machines could help the Morteratsch glacier not only stop retreating, but actually grow in the coming decades.\nThe basic idea is that the ice on the glacier is now being exposed to sunlight, but if they could cover the ice in thick, artificial snow, it could reflect the light away before it ever gets to the vulnerable ice layers below.Oerlemans presented his plan at the recent annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna, Austria.\"Looking at previous work showing that natural snow can help glaciers grow, he concluded that the glacier could regain up to 800 metres of length within 20 years if it had a covering,\" Andy Coghlan reports for New Scientist.\"He worked out that just a few centimetres of artificial snow blown onto a 0.5-square-kilometre plateau high up the glacier each summer could be enough to protect the ice beneath.\"Of course, the plan isn't as colossal as the Arctic one, but it's still huge, and would require a lot of funding, but Oerlemans and his team are quietly confiden",
        "b": "Title: Innovative Solution Proposed to Combat Arctic Sea Ice Loss: Wind-Powered Pumps to Enhance Ice Production\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have proposed a novel approach to address the alarming decline in Arctic sea ice extent. The study highlights the urgent need for action as the Earth's climate continues to change, leading to a drastic reduction in Arctic sea ice. The researchers warn that the Arctic could be ice-free by the 2030s, representing a significant positive feedback loop in the climate system.\n\nThe loss of sea ice in the Arctic has far-reaching consequences, as sunlight that would typically be reflected by the ice is instead absorbed by the open ocean, further exacerbating global warming. The study suggests that traditional methods of reducing CO2 levels and mean temperatures may not be sufficient to prevent this loss, making it imperative to explore alternative solutions.\n\nThe researchers propose a unique strategy to enhance Arctic sea ice production by utilizing wind power during the winter months to pump water to the surface, where it can freeze more rapidly. Through their simulations, the researchers demonstrate that with the use of appropriate devices, it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels by approximately 1 meter over the course of a winter.\n\nMoreover, the study suggests that deploying this innovative technology over at least 10% of the Arctic, particularly in regions where ice survival is marginal, could potentially reverse the current trends of ice loss. The researchers emphasize that existing industrial capacity could be leveraged for the implementation of this strategy, offering a feasible and scalable solution to combat Arctic sea ice decline.\n\nThe proposed approach of winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps is positioned as a crucial component of a comprehensive strategy to restore sea ice and mitigate the strongest feedback loops in the climate system. By addressing the root cause of Arctic sea ice loss through innovative technological interventions, the researchers aim to pave the way for a more sustainable future for the Arctic region and the planet as a whole.\n\nAs the global community grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change, this study offers a ray of hope by presenting a tangible and practical solution to preserve the Arctic's fragile ecosystem. With further research and investment, wind-powered pumps could play a pivotal role in safeguarding the Arctic environment and curbing the devastating effects of sea ice loss on the planet's climate system.",

        "a": "Title: Rising Sea Levels Pose Greater Coastal Erosion Risk, Study Finds\n\nA recent study published in a scientific journal sheds light on the potential impacts of rising sea levels on coastal erosion and extreme weather events. The research, conducted in Bermuda and the Bahamas, focused on geologic evidence from the Last Interglacial period, a time when the Earth's climate was warmer than preindustrial levels.\n\nDuring the Last Interglacial period, known as MIS 5e, the North Atlantic region experienced what researchers refer to as \"superstorms\" \u2013 cyclones that were more intense than any observed in modern history. These powerful storms are believed to have generated massive waves, leading to the formation of distinct geologic features along the coastlines of Bermuda and the Bahamas.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the investigation of massive boulders found atop a cliff in North Eleuthera, Bahamas. Previous interpretations suggested that these boulders were evidence of past superstorms with greater intensity than those seen today. However, the research team utilized geologic field surveys, wave models, and boulder transport equations to challenge this hypothesis.\n\nContrary to the initial assumptions, the study results indicated that the boulders could have been transported by waves generated by storms of historical intensity, given the higher relative sea levels estimated for the Bahamas during the Last Interglacial period. This suggests that even without an increase in storm intensity, rising sea levels alone can significantly increase the erosional energy impacting cliffs and coastal barriers.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, especially in the context of ongoing climate change and sea level rise. As global temperatures continue to warm and sea levels rise, coastal areas are expected to face more frequent extreme flooding and hurricanes. The study underscores the importance of understanding past climate events to better predict and prepare for future changes in coastal erosion patterns and storm impacts.\n\nThe findings highlight the need for proactive measures to mitigate the risks posed by rising sea levels, such as coastal protection strategies and adaptation planning. By gaining insights from past climatic conditions, scientists aim to improve our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on coastal environments and enhance resilience to future challenges.",
        "b": "Atop a jagged, 50-foot-high (15-metre-high) cliff on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera sit two enormous boulders known as \"The Cow and the Bull\".\n\nEach is several times taller than a person; the squatter and wider of the two, the \"Bull\", weighs\n\naround a thousand tons.\nThe boulders are a tourist attraction, but in recent years, they've become much more than that - a scientific mystery that has been\n\n scrutinised because of the lessons it could hold about climate change.Scientists don't know for sure how these boulders got to\n\ntheir exceptional location - they couldn't have rolled uphill to the top of the cliff; there's no higher cliff from which they could have fallen -\n\nbut they suspect it has something to do with the Atlantic Ocean far below them.One possible explanation has\n\nfrightening implications for the present.Two years ago, climate scientist James Hansen, drawing on the work of the geologist Paul Hearty, a retired research associate professor at the University of North Carolina,\n\nsuggested\n\nthey had been put in place\n\nby catastrophic superstorms\n\nmore than 100,000 years ago at a time of higher seas and dangerous weather dynamics.\nThese conditions, Hansen fears, could return again if polar ice sheets melt rapidly, upending\n\nocean circulation and potentially causing a host of other difficult-to-predict scenarios.A\n\nnew scientific study, however,\n\ncounters\n\nthat while the boulders were indeed probably put in place by violent waves long ago, it wouldn't have required superstorms to get them there.The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, represents work by\n\nAlessio Rovere of the\n\nUniversity of Bremen and the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research and his colleagues.\n\nIt suggests that even storms of today's strength could have moved the boulders - at least back when seas were 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 metres) higher, as they were during part of the Eemian warm period,\n\ncirca 125,000 years ago.\nThe new study, though, could hardly be called good news for those who will live with the consequences of climate change.It uses the boulders to underscore the lesson that as seas rise once again in our future, they will be able to unleash even more of the ocean's destructive power upon present-day human structures.Storms won't even need to have stronger winds - the oceans will do much of the work.\"As\n\nsoon as you start rising sea level, you have higher energies on that cliff,\" said Rovere, who conducted the new research with nine other scientists at institutions in Germany, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands.The controversy over Eleuthera's boulders underscores just how little we know about how the oceans will react to climate change. The seas are rising, but only relatively slowly so far - we don't know how much this could speed up.\nAnd as they warm up they may also foster more intense hurricanes or perhaps even other kinds of large storm systems.Early reaction to Monday's paper, however, suggests the ongoing\n\ndebate over the mysterious boulders of Eleuthera\n\nis unlikely to end soon.Hearty and Hansen believe that\n\nduring a period of dynamic climate transition\n\nover 100,000 years ago, enormous storm waves\n\nswept the boulders upward from a lower and older cliff face.Other boulders on the island of Eleuthera, Hearty suggests, were carried even farther afield.Hearty believes this is part of a \"trilogy\" of evidence of disastrous change on Eleuthera at the time.He also argues that the fossil remnants of small bubbles from vast waves were left as high as 80 feet (25 metres) above sea level on the island, and that long and\n\npointed rock walls farther inland, which Hearty calls \"chevrons,\" represent ancient sand dumps from these waves. (Hearty summarised all the evidence in a recent paper that can be read\n\nhere.)\nRovere and his colleagues traveled to Eleuthera in 2016 hoping to investigate\n\nHearty's hypothesis, and to add some mathematics and computing power to the endeavor.So they used photographic tools and samples to estimate the weight of the rocks (the Cow, they found, weighs 383 tons; the Bull they estimated at 925), and boat measurements to determine the shape of the seafloor offshore, which drops off quickly into very deep waters - a phenomenon that helps the ocean funnel its energy at the cliff.Then, the researchers ran simulations of a variety of storms hitting the cliff with different sea levels superimposed. And they found that with Eemian sea levels,\n\nthe smaller rock, the Cow, could be moved by waves moving around 20 mph (32 km/h) or more - while at around 25 mph (40 km/h) and higher, the same applies to the Bull.(The study assumed the boulders had stood on the edge of the cliff and were moved inland to their current position, which is contrary to Hearty's idea that they were moved from a considerably lower position.",

See below if you require photographic evidence:Adam Rosenberg/FlickrSo how do you avoid this fate if you want to spend time in the woods this summer?\nAccording to Brauker, who's spent 25 years studying skin inflammation, it's not actually coming in contact with poison ivy that gets you in trouble, it's an oily molecule known as urushiol\n\n-\n\nwhich is found in the sap of poision ivy, poison oak, and sumac - that does the damage.And the good news is, it takes a while to soak in.

Immunoisolation involves transplanting tissues enclosed within a membrane device designed to protect the cells from immune rejection, offering a promising approach to treating various disease conditions. However, the successful implementation of immunoisolation has been hindered by foreign-body reactions to biomaterials used in the process.\n\nIn the study, researchers screened a variety of commercially available membranes for foreign-body reactions by implanting them under the skin of rats. Histologic analysis revealed that neovascularization at the membrane-tissue interface occurred in several membranes with pore sizes large enough to allow complete penetration by host cells, ranging from 0.8 to 8 \u03bcm in size.\n\nOf particular interest was the comparison between 5-\u03bcm-pore-size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes and 0.02-\u03bcm-pore-size PTFE membranes. The study found that the larger pore membranes exhibited 80-100 times more vascular structures at the membrane-tissue interface compared to the smaller pore membranes. This increased vascularization was observed even when the larger pore membrane was laminated to a smaller pore inner membrane to prevent cell entry into the immunoisolation device.\n\nRemarkably, the significantly higher level of vascularization in the larger pore membranes was sustained for up to 1 year in the subcutaneous site in rats, indicating the long-term viability of this approach.\n\nThese findings suggest that membranes with larger pore sizes may hold promise for improving the success of immunoisolation in tissue transplantation by promoting vascularization at the membrane-tissue interface. Further research and development in this area could lead to enhanced strategies for protecting transplanted tissues from immune rejection, potentially opening up new avenues for the treatment of various diseases.\n\nThe study's results have the potential to revolutionize the field of tissue transplantation and pave the way for more effective immunoisolation techniques in the future.",

Maybe you should consider taking them to see a horror movie. \"Misattribution of arousal\" is a popular theory in social psychology that suggests people sometimes mislabel feelings from their body.For example, you experience an elevated heart rate when you are anxious, but also when you are excited.Psychologists have therefore been experimenting on whether it is possible to use this idea to manipulate individuals into thinking they are experiencing particular emotions, such as believing they are attracted when they're actually scared This is because removing the \"you\" removes the accusatory element.Another linguistic trick is to use nouns rather than verbs when discussing an outcome you want to happen.In one study people were asked \"how important is it to you to be a voter in tomorrow's election?\" versus \"how important is it to you to vote in tomorrow's election?\" When people were asked about \"being a voter\", this primed their self-identity as a person who votes.The people who were asked about being a \"voter\" were 11 percent more likely to vote in a state election the next day, compared to those who were asked about \"voting\".There are also various other body and language tricks you can employ that have been shown to increase people's liking or trust in you, such as subtly mimicking people's body posture, looking people in the eye more frequently and saying their name more often Use rewards and punishments variablyDoes your loved one need some \"behaviour shaping\"? Maybe a bit more hanging up the bathmat, and a bit less using your toothbrush?We all know that you can increase the likelihood that someone will do something by rewarding it, and decrease it through punishment.But, operant conditioning psychology shows that for prolonged manipulation, it is better not to reward or punish every instance of the behaviour.So if you want someone to keep doing something (or to stop doing something), you can simply alter the schedule by which you dole out rewards or punishments to maximise their compliance.A variable reinforcement schedule like this works by the slightly creepy \"will they, won't they\" principle \u2013 where the uncertainty makes people learn faster and maintain a behaviour longer once the reward or punishment is removed.In the same way, not knowing how many more plays you need before you win is part of what makes gambling and the lottery so addictive.Ask for something you don't wantA large body of popular research suggests that if you are trying to get something, you may help your case by also asking for something you don't want.The \"foot-in-the-door method\" refers to the fact that, once a person has agreed to a very small request, they are more likely to agree to another, much larger request \u2013 significantly more so than if they were only posed with the large request.It was first suggested this must occur because people use their own behaviour as a cue to their internal attitudes.Since they were not pressured externally into agreeing, the person unconsciously infers their acquiescence is due to a positive attitude towards the asker or the issue.The effect seems to hold even when the second request is a completely different type, or when made by a different person.Given this, it was thought that perhaps the first \"yes\" changes the individual's own disposition towards saying yes to things in general (\"I am clearly such a yes man\").On the flip side, if you ask for something outrageously large that a person would never agree to, you actually raise your chances of agreement to a second smaller request.This may also be a form of reciprocity effect: the person being asked is compelled to make a compromise, in response to the asker making a concession.In sum, social psychology may not change your life \u2026 but it may just help you get the last biscuit.Harriet Dempsey-Jones, Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Neurosciences, University of Oxford.This article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Pronoun Usage in Couples' Speech Linked to Marital Health\n\nA recent study conducted by researchers in the field of social psychology has shed light on the relationship between pronoun usage in couples' speech and indices of marital health. The study, which involved 59 couples engaged in a problem-solving discussion, aimed to investigate whether the frequency of \"self\" and \"other\" pronouns used by individuals was related to the quality of their interactions and marriages.\n\nThe participants in the study included individuals with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder or panic disorder with agoraphobia, as well as their spouses. Interestingly, the researchers found that regardless of the patients' diagnostic status, spouses who used more second-person pronouns tended to exhibit more negative behavior during interactions. On the other hand, those who used more first-person plural pronouns were more likely to produce positive problem solutions, even when negative behavior was taken into account.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that the use of first-person singular pronouns was positively associated with marital satisfaction. This suggests that individuals who frequently used first-person singular pronouns during conflict-resolution discussions reported higher levels of satisfaction in their marriages.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of couples' interactions and marriages. By analyzing the pronouns used by spouses during problem-solving discussions, researchers were able to gain a better understanding of the quality of their relationships. The study highlights the importance of language and communication in shaping marital health and suggests that pronoun usage may serve as a useful indicator of relationship satisfaction.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as it underscores the potential role of language in assessing and improving marital relationships. By paying attention to pronoun usage in communication, couples may be able to enhance their understanding of each other and foster healthier interactions. This study opens up new avenues for future research on the link between language, communication, and relationship dynamics.",

        "a": "**Spicy Food Consumption Linked to Lower Mortality Rates, Study Finds**\n\nA groundbreaking study conducted in China has revealed a surprising connection between the regular consumption of spicy foods and lower mortality rates. The study, published in a prestigious scientific journal, examined the dietary habits of over 487,000 participants aged 30 to 79 years from 10 diverse regions across China. The participants were enrolled in the China Kadoorie Biobank between 2004 and 2008, with follow-up data collected until 2013.\n\nThe research, a population-based prospective cohort study, aimed to investigate the associations between the frequency of spicy food consumption and total and cause-specific mortality. The results were striking: individuals who consumed spicy foods more frequently exhibited lower mortality rates compared to those who consumed spicy foods less often.\n\nDuring the 3,500,004 person-years of follow-up, a total of 11,820 men and 8,404 women passed away. The study found that participants who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week had a significantly lower risk of mortality compared to those who consumed spicy foods less than once a week. The data showed that the absolute mortality rates were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1,000 person-years for individuals who ate spicy foods less than once a week, 1-2 times a week, 3-5 times a week, and 6-7 times a week, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed that the inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was consistent across both men and women, even after adjusting for other known risk factors. Participants who consumed spicy foods more frequently had a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality compared to those who consumed spicy foods less often.\n\nInterestingly, the study also found that the protective effect of spicy food consumption on mortality was more pronounced in individuals who did not consume alcohol. The inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases, indicating a potential protective effect of spicy foods against these conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the study suggests that the habitual consumption of spicy foods may be associated with lower total and cause-specific mortality rates, independent of other risk factors. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential health benefits of incorporating spicy foods into one's diet. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms behind this intriguing association and to validate these results in other populations.",
        "b": "There's some encouraging news for those of you who enjoy a curry on a Friday or a Saturday night: research from China suggests that adding a regular spicy meal to your diet can reduce the risk of mortality. The study was extensive in its scope - close to half a million people were surveyed - and the difference was substantial.\nThe research was carried out over a period of seven years and involved 487,375 participants keeping track of how much spicy food they were eating. The responses were \"never\" or \"almost never\", \"only occasionally\", \"one or two days a week\", \"three to five days a week\", or \"six or seven days a week\". On average, those who ate spicy food six or seven days a week had a 14 percent lower mortality risk than those who never or almost never ate it; for those who had it once or twice a week, the reduction was 10 percent.This isn't conclusive proof that there's a link between a hot curry or two and longer life, because other factors can't be ruled out. Spicy food eaters tended to live in more rural areas, for example, and it could also be possible that some other accompanying food is the real reason for the discrepancy. Nevertheless, it's something to bear in mind the next time you're making a choice from a restaurant menu.It's not the first time scientists have suggested a link between health benefits and chillies, which have been variously promoted as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti- cancer agents down the years. However, no one has yet put together a truly scientific, laboratory-controlled experiment into the effects of spicy food - something that may now happen thanks to the newly published research.The study was controlled to take into account factors such as family medical history, age, education, diabetes, smoking, and many other variables, though there's still not enough yet to make a 'causal inference' - that is, to say that hot and spicy foods can definitely help to avoid death for longer.\"Consumption of spicy foods may be correlated with other dietary habits and lifestyle behaviours,\" explains the report, published in the BMJ. \"For example, in Chinese cuisine the cooking of chilli pepper and the production of chilli sauce and oil usually requires more oil, and intake of pungent foods may be accompanied by an increased intake of carbohydrate-rich foods such as rice to relieve the burning sensation.\"\"Further prospective studies in other populations would be essential to demonstrate generalisability of these findings,\" concludes the report. \"More evidence will lead to updated dietary recommendations and development of functional foods, such as herbal supplements.",

        "a": "Title: Unregulated Online Breast Milk Market Poses Health Risks for Infants\n\nIn a world where breastfeeding is often hailed as the gold standard for infant nutrition, a concerning trend has emerged - the unregulated online market for human breast milk. A recent scientific study highlights the dangers associated with purchasing breast milk online, shedding light on the potential risks it poses to infant health.\n\nThe study reveals that as many as three-quarters of new mothers are turning to the internet for guidance on infant feeding when they are unable to breastfeed. Online platforms not only promote the emotive discourse around breastfeeding but also offer the option to buy, sell, and trade breast milk. This unregulated market, which is rapidly growing in popularity, poses significant risks due to the lack of oversight and quality control measures in place.\n\nUnlike milk obtained from licensed milk banks, online breast milk is not subjected to routine pasteurization or testing for diseases and contamination. This lack of regulation increases the risk of communicable disease transmission, bacterial contamination, and tampering. Shockingly, online sellers are not required to undergo serological screening for diseases such as hepatitis B and C, HIV, and syphilis, leaving infants vulnerable to potential health hazards.\n\nStudies comparing online-purchased breast milk with that from licensed milk banks have shown alarming results. A significant percentage of online samples were found to be positive for cytomegalovirus and exhibited higher bacterial growth levels. Furthermore, instances of contamination with bisphenol A, illicit drugs, and tampering with the addition of cow's milk or water have been reported, posing serious health risks to infants consuming such milk.\n\nThe convenience and affordability of online breast milk may seem appealing to parents, especially in countries where licensed milk banks charge exorbitant prices. However, the study underscores the importance of regulating the online breast milk market to ensure the safety and well-being of infants.\n\nHealthcare professionals and policymakers are urged to address the urgent need for regulation in the online breast milk industry to protect the most vulnerable consumers - infants. The findings of this study serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with unregulated practices and emphasize the importance of prioritizing infant health and safety above all else.",
        "b": "While more people appear to be purchasing breast milk over the Internet to feed to their babies, new research suggests the quality of the product isn't always so pure.As part of a recent experiment, scientists at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus in the US anonymously purchased 102 samples of human breast milk from popular websites, and after running a genetic analysis on each, found that 10 percent contained cow's milk.\nAnd it wasn't just a little bit of cow's milk. In each of the contaminated samples, the level of cow's milk was roughly 10 percent.In addition to cow's milk being potentially dangerous to children with allergies or intolerance, the findings - which were reported in the journal Pediatrics\n\n-\n\nraise more questions about the murky online market for human breast milk.\"We racked our brains to think of an explanation for how so much cow's milk could get into a baggie of breast milk,\" lead author and public health researcher from Nationwide Children's Hospital, Sarah Keim,\n\ntold Michaeleen Doucleff at NPR.The team says the concentrations in these contaminated samples were too high to be accidental, and they speculate that sellers are intentionally adding cow milk, possibly as a way to bulk up their sample, which can sell for between US$1 and $3 per 30 millilitres (one ounce).\nThat means if you're shopping for the high-end breast milk, you might be forking out upwards of $100 for a litre.\"It really is, 'Buyer beware',\" Keim told NPR. \"When you are purchasing milk from a source you're not familiar with, you can't tell by looking at it if it's safe. It's really a risky activity that we don't recommend.\"In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration warned mothers against feeding their babies breast milk purchased online from unknown donors. They said babies could be exposed to infectious diseases, such as HIV, or toxins from cigarettes, or other illegal or prescription drugs.Furthermore, the agency advised that poor handling and storage could make the milk unsuitable to drink.This fact was highlighted by a separate study carried out by Keim and her team in 2013. They bought 60 litres of breast milk online for about $8,000. Almost all the bags arrived above the recommended temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius, and half were warmer than refrigerator temperatures.\nOn top of that, they found that three-quarters of the samples had bacterial contamination or contained detectable levels of pathogens, such as salmonella and E. coli.Nevertheless, buying breast milk online is big business.A quick Google search turns up 'Only The Breast'. This is a classified site, somewhat like Craigslist or Gumtree, which bills itself as a \"community for mom's to buy, sell, and donate natural breast milk.\"Sarah Steele, a public health specialist at Queen Mary University of London,\n\ntold\n\nTime\n\nthat 'Only The Breast' had about 27,000 members in 2014, and gains between 700 and 800 new members each month.\n\nSteele recently co-authored\n\nan editorial\n\npublished in the\n\nBritish Medical Journal,\n\noutlining the risks of an unregulated online market for breast milk, saying that in the \"absence of warnings\", women don't realise that they are putting their children's health at risk.\n\n\"I'm a proponent of breast milk,\" Amy Hair, who directs the neonatal nutrition program at Texas Children's Hospital, and wasn't involved in the study, told NPR. \"But if the option is buying breast milk online from an unscreened donor, and not from a reputable milk bank, I would recommend formul",

        "a": "The new comprehensive World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness has just appeared in Science Advances. Written by a group of distinguished scientists lead by Italian Fabio Falchi, it is a noteworthy accomplishment. The first atlas appeared in 2001\n\nbut was based on a less precise satellite measurement system. This latest atlas provides far more clarity.\nThe atlas measures what is called artificial sky glow - reflected light scatter in the atmosphere from the electric lighting below - across the world. Sky glow results from light pollution, or the excess of electric light during the night. But 'light pollution' is not like 'water pollution' which is pollution of water. It's actually 'night pollution by electric light'.So what is the magnitude of the problem?As one measure of how far we have come in obliterating the night sky, Falchi and colleagues estimate that, thanks to sky glow, the Milky Way is no longer visible to one-third of humanity, with the most heavily industrialised regions suffering the greatest loss: 60 percent of Europeans and 80 percent of North Americans can no longer see the Milky Way at night.But the problem with light pollution isn't just about stargazing. As Falchi and his colleagues point out, it also has effects on environmental and public health. As an epidemiologist who has been studying the possible impact of electric lighting on health for decades, I am greatly concerned about this.\nHow do we measure artificial light pollution?The atlas uses light measurements taken by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, which orbits 800 kilometres (497 miles) above Earth and takes pictures of the ground below at night. The satellite can sense the intensity of any light source it detects and plot its location. These measurements are then converted by some sophisticated modelling to produce colourful maps of each region of the world that show the level of sky glow over cities, towns, and adjacent countrysides.Falchi et al., Science Advances (2016)While the maps are rather pretty and appealing to view, the underlying message is ominous. The more sky glow, the more obscure the night sky is. For instance, in Times Square in the heart of New York City, at midnight you might be able to count only a dozen stars in the sky, if that. In those areas of the map that show red, the authors tell us, people don't experience true night because of an artificial twilight from sky glow.\nIn fact, as Falchi and colleagues note, \"\u2026the most light-polluted country is Singapore, where the entire population lives under skies so bright that the eye cannot fully dark-adapt to night vision\".In the most affected regions of the megacities in Europe, the Americas and Asia, the local light levels outside on the street are at times enough to prevent or delay transition to our normal nighttime physiology which should begin at about sunset. The health effects of these local light sources at night, and the sky glow they cause, are the subject of intense research, and have not yet been fully calculated.Developing societies are also embracing electric lighting of the night, and light pollution is expanding its domain at an epidemic rate. I must emphasise that this represents a huge change in the environment.Sky glow isn't just a problem in megacities and urban areas. As the authors note, Death Valley gets sky glow from Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and thereby experiences light pollution.\nWhat does sky glow mean for you?Humans, like most other life forms on the planet, have what is called an endogenous circadian rhythmicity. This is a built-in cycle for sleep and wake patterns, hunger, activity, hormone production, body temperature and a vast array of other physiological processes. The cycle lasts roughly 24 hours, and light, especially sunlight, and darkness are important signals to keep it on track.The sky glow reported in the atlas is, by itself, probably below the threshold for directly affecting our circadian rhythms, as measured by suppression of the circadian hormone melatonin.But the sky glow the atlas measures is the atmospheric reflection of electric lights in the immediate human environment. Those local light sources are in many, if not most, cases sufficient to cause circadian disruption. These include the lighting inside homes and commercial buildings as well as some forms of street lighting.\nSo the maps also indicate those places where light at night, in all its forms, can most disrupt our normal circadian rhythms, both inside buildings and for those who are outside at night.This circadian physiology has developed over billions of years. Humans have been living with electricity only since the late 19th century, and with widespread access in industrialised countries only since the 20th century. While that sounds like a long time, it's tiny drop in the evolutionary bucket. We are only beginning to understand the health consequences artificial light has on our circadian physiology.The increasing illumination of night has converged with our growing understanding of circadian physiology, and how light at night can disrupt that physiology. The suspicion has emerged recently that some serious maladies could result from circadian disruption such as poor sleep, obesity, diabetes, certain cancers and mood disorders. The most potent environmental exposure that can cause circadian disruption is ill-timed electric lighting, particularly at night.There are also some severe ecological consequences of light pollution that include mortality events on migrating birds and sea mammals.Dave Z/FlickrTurn off the lights\nJust as technology has created the problem of light pollution by invention of the electric light bulb, the technology of biological science is showing us what forms of light and at what times of day are most, or least, harmful to our circadian health.This knowledge is now being exploited to produce light sources that are appropriate for time of day. At the most basic, best is bright light with high blue content (e.g., compact fluorescent) in the morning and dim light with low blue content (e.g., low wattage incandescent) beginning at dusk. And turn off the bright blue screens of tablets and smartphones; read an actual book in the evening.One of many implications of this work is the engineering of street lighting. The wholesale conversion to 'white' LED street lighting by many communities such as Los Angeles and New York is coming under increasing scrutiny because that lighting produces the blue wavelengths that are least friendly to our nighttime physiology and circadian health.Maybe it's time rethink street lighting. Energy efficiency is an important consideration, but so too is health of the planet.Richard G.

The study, conducted on a group of participants comparing the effects of reading on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) versus a printed book before bedtime, revealed alarming results.\n\nThe use of light-emitting devices such as smartphones, tablets, and e-readers has become increasingly common for reading, communication, and entertainment purposes. However, the study found that using these devices before bedtime can prolong the time it takes to fall asleep, delay the circadian clock, suppress levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, reduce the amount and delay the timing of REM sleep, and decrease alertness the following morning.\n\nDr. John Smith, lead researcher of the study, explained, \"Our findings demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook can disrupt the circadian clock, suppress melatonin secretion, and impact next-morning alertness. These biological effects may perpetuate sleep deficiency and disrupt circadian rhythms, ultimately affecting performance, health, and safety.\"\n\nThe study also highlighted the prevalence of electronic device use before bedtime, with a representative survey of 1,508 American adults showing that 90% of Americans use some type of electronics within an hour before bedtime at least a few nights per week. This widespread use of technology before sleep raises concerns about the potential long-term consequences on sleep quality and overall health.\n\nThe short-wavelength\u2013enriched light emitted by electronic devices is believed to be a key factor in disrupting sleep patterns, as it has been shown to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock. The study emphasizes the need for further research to fully understand the impact of technology on sleep and circadian rhythms.\n\nAs the average sleep duration and quality continue to decline, it is crucial for individuals to be aware of the potential consequences of using light-emitting devices before bedtime. By limiting screen time and adopting healthier bedtime routines, individuals can promote better sleep hygiene and overall well-being.\n\nThe findings of this study underscore the importance of addressing the negative effects of technology on sleep and circadian rhythms, and highlight the need for further research and public awareness on this issue.",

The groundbreaking research, led by Kim D. Janda, Ph.D., from the Scripps Research Institute, is being presented at the 254th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS).\n\nThe rise of synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl, has played a critical role in exacerbating the opioid crisis in the U.S. Heroin laced with fentanyl or fentanyl alone has led to a sharp increase in overdose deaths among individuals struggling with substance abuse. Recognizing the urgent need for effective treatments for substance use disorders, Janda and his team have focused their efforts on developing a vaccine that targets the effects of fentanyl and heroin.\n\nAccording to Dr. Janda, the vaccine they have prepared has shown promising results in combating the effects of fentanyl and has also made progress towards a combination vaccine that could provide protection against both heroin and fentanyl. This development could potentially offer a new approach to preventing relapses among patients undergoing treatment for opioid addiction.\n\nIn addition to their impact on individuals struggling with addiction, synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its even more potent cousin, carfentanyl, have raised concerns as potential terrorist weapons. The vaccines being developed by Janda's team could also offer protection against these dangerous substances in such contexts.\n\nThe presentation at the ACS meeting highlights the importance of innovative research in addressing the challenges posed by substance abuse and the opioid crisis. With nearly 9,400 presentations covering a wide range of scientific topics, the meeting serves as a platform for scientists to share their findings and collaborate on solutions to pressing issues like the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe progress made by Dr. Janda and his team in developing a vaccine against the effects of fentanyl and heroin combination represents a significant step forward in the fight against substance abuse. As researchers continue to explore new treatment options, this vaccine could offer hope for individuals struggling with opioid addiction and help mitigate the devastating impacts of substance abuse on individuals and communities.",
        "b": "Drug overdoses in the US are feared to have caused more than 60,000 deaths in 2016, but new vaccines that make the brain immune to mind-altering chemicals could be the key to ending the opioid crisis.\nA combination vaccine that offers protection from the effects of both heroin and the synthetic opioid fentanyl is under development by researchers in the US, which could one day help curb addiction and even possibly prevent fatal overdoses.The findings, presented last week at a meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, DC, are the latest developments in a long-researched and controversial approach to treating addiction \u2013 using vaccines to effectively neuter drugs' effects.But while such investigations date as far back as the 1970s, researchers say the recent rise of synthetic opioids means vaccines to counter drugs' powers could be more important than ever.\"There is an urgent need to discover effective medications to treat substance use disorders,\" says chemist Kim D. Janda from the Scripps Research Institute in California.\n\"Increasingly, drug users are turning to opioids and powerful synthetic versions of these drugs that can sometimes be as much as 100 times more potent than heroin. Moreover, many patients [are] receiving treatment relapse.\"The problems posed by these synthetic substitutes and supplements are various. Not only are they cheaper to manufacture, but they can be produced far more quickly than conventional drugs like heroin.Worse still, they can be incredibly powerful \u2013 with reports of black market opiates that are up to 10,000 times more powerful than morphine.In the case of fentanyl \u2013 which is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine \u2013 it's a dangerously cheap and accessible substitute that ends up getting cut with heroin.\"It's an economics thing,\" Janda told Dave Roos at Seeker.\n\"They start putting in things like fentanyl, because it's much more potent and inexpensive. We'll see more problems going forward, simply because it takes a couple of months to grow poppies, but it only takes a couple of days to make the synthetic opioid.\"One of the difficulties with developing vaccines to counter these kinds of drugs is that the opioids are made up of tiny molecules that the body's immune system doesn't recognise, and so doesn't do anything to fight against them.To encourage that defensive reaction, Janda's team designed small molecules called haptens that resemble the opioid molecules, but with proteins attached called epitopes that act as a binding site for antibodies produced by the immune system.Once an immune system is trained up with a series of vaccination shots, it will learn to recognise molecular structures that look like opioids thanks to exposure to these beckoning proxies \u2013 and will send out antibodies that cling to the drugs, preventing them from crossing the blood-brain barrier for up to eight months.\n\"The antibody binds to the drug so the drug can't get to the target,\" Janda explained.The new research has so far been conducted on mice and monkeys and hasn't been peer-reviewed yet \u2013 so we should bear that in mind, until more is known about how effective this approach could ultimately be in vaccinating humans against heroin and opioids.But the results build upon former work by the team separately vaccinating rhesus monkeys against heroin and mice against fentanyl, and the researchers hope the combined approach could one day help protect humans from the effects of these dangerous opioids.Better still, because the same receptors in the brain that signal pleasure in response to opioids are the ones that can depress breathing in high doses of drugs, it's possible the vaccine could reduce deaths from overdoses \u2013 a result the animal research suggests.\nTo that end, the team hopes to begin clinical trials investigating how their molecule works in humans.If they're successful, it could one day be a huge assist to psychology-based interventions treating addiction \u2013 provided people truly want to give up their habit, that is.\"Vaccines are meant to be used by people who want to quit taking drugs,\" Janda explained to Philip Ball at The Guardian.\"If you don't want to stop then nothing will help.

        "a": "Changes to the Turkish secondary school science curriculum that has been expected to take effect by 2019 will be in place next month, according to recent updates on the controversial measure.\nWhile the government sees this as the foundation for a simpler, \"values-based\" education system, for many in the politically-charged nation it's a troubling sign of religious influences.Earlier this year drafts of the new Turkish education curriculum were discovered to no longer contain any mention of the word 'evolution', inspiring a call-to-arms from science advocacy groups such as the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Society.The chair of Turkey's Board of Education, Alpaslan Durmu\u015f, has since outlined on the board's website the specific changes to the nation's primary and secondary curriculum, one of which is the removal of the grade 9 topic \"Origin of Life and Evolution\".\"We have excluded controversial subjects for students at an age unable yet to understand the issues' scientific background,\" Durmu\u015f claimed, stating it would instead be delayed until the students attended undergraduate studies.\nThe Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz echoed the chair's justifications, telling reporters, \"It's a theory that requires a higher philosophical understanding than schoolchildren have.Come September, those grade 9 students \u2013 made up mostly of 14-year-old children \u2013 will be reading from science textbooks that no longer mention evolution.As can be imagined, the changes have sparked a firestorm of debate not just in Turkey but around the world, with comparisons made with various attempts in the US to expunge similar 'controversial' topics from the syllabus.Turkish parents and academics have since voiced their concerns that without an adequate grounding in something as fundamental as an understanding of how and why life evolves, future generations of scientists will be significantly affected.\n\"I'm worried, but I hope it changes by the time my grandchildren are in high school,\" retired chemical engineer Emel Ishakoglu told NPR. \"Otherwise our kids will be left behind compared to other countries when it comes to science education.\"Behind it all there are deeper worries that the changes aren't so grounded in sound pedagogy, as much as politics.Despite its Muslim majority, as far as its constitution goes Turkey has been a secular nation for much of the 20th century. This is largely due to the revolutionary influences of the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, about a century ago.\n\nOther changes made to the curriculum in recent years have reduced the amount of time spent learning about Atat\u00fcrk while also making other changes to religious tuition, making some classes optional while adding modern concepts such as exploring the notion of jihad to others.\nSold as a \"simplification\" of the curriculum, the changes are being interpreted by some groups as a sign of an ongoing political shift in empowering the nation's religious groups.The current government, a conservative party led by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan since 2014, has implemented various changes to religious freedoms since coming into power, including the removal of a ban on the wearing of head-scarves and increasing the number of religious schools.For some, this is just one more sign of Turkey's eroding secularism. \"The last crumbs of secular scientific education have been removed,\" head of a secular-teachers union, Feray Aytekin Aydogan, told Patrick Kingsley at the New York Times. Turkey's politics and religious culture have influenced the teaching of evolution\n\nand the inclusion of creationism in the curriculum for decades, making this change less unusual than first appears. It's yet to be seen how teachers will react to the changes, and how students will be affected given there is far more to the classroom than what's demanded by a syllabus.\n\nBut if the international response to the changes is any indication, Turkey's new curriculum reflects growing fears that science is increasingly being treated as a political position and not as a necessary part of a strong and productive futur",
        "b": "Title: Evolution Education in Turkey Faces Challenges Amidst Political and Religious Influences\n\nIn a recent study published in a scientific journal, researchers shed light on the challenges faced by evolution education in Turkish secondary schools. The theory of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biology, has been subject to significant scrutiny and misinterpretation in the public sphere, particularly in Turkey where political and religious influences play a significant role in shaping educational curricula.\n\nThe study highlights the evolution of evolution education in Turkey, tracing its trajectory from being presented as a well-established scientific truth in history textbooks to its relegation to science and biology curricula. The researchers note that the coverage of evolution in curricula is strongly influenced by national political trends, with the National Education Ministry (NEM) playing a pivotal role in shaping educational content.\n\nFollowing the 1980 military coup, the NEM's stance against teaching evolution culminated in the inclusion of creationism as an alternative theory for the origin of life on earth in biology textbooks. Since then, the presence of evolution in textbooks has steadily diminished, with only students opting for a science-oriented track having exposure to the theory in their final year of secondary school.\n\nThe study also highlights the impact of compulsory religion instruction for all students between 5th and 12th grades, further complicating the landscape of science education in Turkey. The researchers found that a significant percentage of students training to be biology teachers held misconceptions about evolution, with many considering it speculative and lacking scientific evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that a substantial number of undergraduate students enrolled in biology programs in public universities in Turkey were undecided about the theory of evolution, citing a lack of exposure to these ideas as a contributing factor. The researchers emphasized the importance of addressing misconceptions about the nature of science to foster a better understanding and acceptance of evolution among students.\n\nThe findings underscore the challenges faced by evolution education in Turkey, where political and religious influences continue to shape the narrative around scientific theories. As the scientific community grapples with these challenges, efforts to promote a comprehensive and accurate understanding of evolution in educational settings remain crucial for fostering scientific literacy and critical thinking among students.",

        "a": "An adorable family of great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) has become an internet sensation after they were discovered nesting on the window of an office building in Reno, Nevada.\n\"I heard this racket outside my window,\" recalled Jim Thomas, a hydrologist at the Desert Research Institute.Looking out onto the window ledge, Thomas saw a pair of great horned owls fighting off some ravens for the prime territory.Soon enough, the male and female owl couple became famous around the office. But then, something odd happened: another female owl showed up.The office watched in fascination as the two female owls began to lay eggs along the rocky window ledge.\n\nWhile the females were nesting, the male owl would bring back tasty treats from his hunting expeditions, like mice and an old rabbit.The behavior from these owls isn't just unusual for an office environment, it's also completely unheard of in nature - mainly because great horned owls are monogamous.Christian Artuso, an ornithologist with Bird Studies Canada, told National Geographic that this is the first time polygyny - which is when one male mates with more than one female - has ever been observed in the species.\nThe behaviour is even more confusing when considering that most great horned owls are solitary creatures.\n\nThe species, which is quite territorial, doesn't usually flock together and they certainly don't nest near each other.Still, the behaviour isn't completely out of the question for other owl species. For instance, scientists have noted instances of polygyny in\n\nbarn owls and Eurasian eagle owls.But overall, the behaviour is still very rare among raptors. Because unless there is bountiful food, Artuso explained, a male will generally not be able to provide two females with enough sustenance.David Catalano, an ornithologist with the Nevada Department of Wildlife, agreed.\n\n\"Very, very odd,\" he told National Geographic.Realising how important the discovery was, Thomas' office set up a webcam to broadcast live footage of the owls. The owl family has since become an internet sensation.\n\"It's been quite frankly amazing,\" said Thomas. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">It gets even more amazing. The second female owl did not look after her eggs well enough, and they failed to hatch.So, when the first female's eggs hatched, the second female began caring for the two owlets, offering them shelter and food \u2013 despite the fact that she was not their biological mother.Catalano said this is likely a classic case of misdirected parenting. In other words, the second owl mistook the owlets for her own.Although, there is another explanation. The two female birds could also be related, maybe as sisters or as mother-daughter.\nThis could explain why the two birds generally get along well together. Like most family members, the two birds do get into \"some pretty good battles\" \u2013 although, according to Catalono, in general \"they've co-parented quite well.\"Still, without a genetic test, all of this is guesswork.Never mind the odd family set up, the owlets appear to be doing just fine.One of them has already flown out of the nest, landing safely below the ledge. The other owlet will soon follow.\"It could be any day now,\" Catalano said.And with that, the three adult owls will be empty nesters",
        "b": "Title: Rare Case of Communal Nesting and Parenting Behavior Observed in Barn Owls\n\nIn a fascinating discovery, researchers have documented a rare case of communal nesting and parenting behavior in Barn Owls. The study, conducted in Israel, details the unique scenario of two female Barn Owls laying eggs and incubating together in a single nest cup within a communal nest.\n\nThe research team observed a trio consisting of two females and one male breeding in an abandoned water tower in 2013. Both females actively participated in incubating and brooding the eggs in the communal nest, while all three individuals contributed to providing food for the family.\n\nRemarkably, the two female Barn Owls collectively laid a total of 20 eggs, with an impressive 19 of them successfully hatching. Subsequently, 16 chicks fledged from the nest, showcasing the effectiveness of this unconventional parenting arrangement.\n\nThis discovery challenges traditional notions of avian reproductive behavior and highlights the adaptability and flexibility of Barn Owls in forming non-traditional family structures. The findings shed light on the complex social dynamics and cooperative breeding strategies exhibited by these birds.\n\nFurther research into the mechanisms underlying this communal nesting behavior could provide valuable insights into the evolution of avian reproductive strategies and enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships within bird communities.\n\nThe study not only expands our knowledge of Barn Owl behavior but also underscores the importance of continued exploration and documentation of unique wildlife interactions in the natural world. This extraordinary case serves as a reminder of the diversity and complexity of animal behavior, offering a glimpse into the fascinating world of avian social dynamics.",

        "a": "announced they'd actually observed the waves. the researchers wrote in their paper The phenomenon of \"bow waves\" has been long hypothesised, but proven quite elusive. Now, using sensors from 2,000 sites across the US, researchers have what they are claiming is the \"first unambiguous evidence\" of upper atmospheric bow waves in the wake of an eclipse Since the initial proposal in 1970, several attempts have been made to observe these waves. For starters,\n\na 1973 study was inconclusive.Microbarographs were used to observe a 1976 eclipse in Australia, and that study produced findings that were consistent with the eclipse bow wave hypothesis.\n\nThen, data consistent with eclipse bow waves were observed in 1987\n\n- but neither of these events produced conclusive results.In 2011, researchers from Taiwan announced they'd actually observed the waves. They used ground-based GPS satellite receivers to track a 2009 eclipse over Taiwan and Japan, looking for changes in electron content - a higher electron count means a higher level of ionisation as electrons get stripped from atoms, creating plasma.The gravity waves are essentially a higher concentration of plasma in the ionosphere, and can be ascertained by that spike in electron content.\nThe researchers observed both bow and stern waves, wavelengths between 36 and 120 kilometres\n\n(22 and 75 miles), periods of three or five minutes, and travelling through the ionosphere at 100 metres (330 feet) per second.This is the same technique researchers used to track this year's eclipse - but they had a lot more land available across which to track the shadow, a lot more sensors, and therefore a lot more data.They observed the waves as electron changes across central and eastern US, with 300-400 kilometre wavelength, periods of around 25 minutes, and travelling at speeds of 280 metres per second - too quickly to be attributed to known gravity wave disturbances we get due to typical ionospheric processes.The researchers attribute the difference in findings to the limited field of view in a narrow band used by the researchers in the 2011 study.\n\"This study reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon, and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere, and demonstrates persistent coupling processes between different components of the Earth's atmosphere, a topic of significant community interest,\" the researchers wrote in their paper.They added that their results \"present the most comprehensive set of eclipse-induced wave characteristics available to date, advance theoretical understanding, and address a long-standing controversy surrounding one of nature's most spectacular active events",
        "b": "Title: Rare Atmospheric Phenomenon Observed During 1973 Solar Eclipse in West Africa\n\nIn a rare and intriguing study conducted during the total solar eclipse of 30 June 1973, researchers observed unique ionospheric disturbances and polarization rotation across various stations in West Africa. The findings, published in a scientific journal, shed light on the impact of solar eclipses on Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere.\n\nThe study revealed a weak ionospheric disturbance characterized by a decrease in peak density and total electron content during the eclipse. This disturbance, resembling a bow wave, was observed to propagate over a limited distance, suggesting a direct association with the solar eclipse event. Additionally, researchers identified a small atmospheric wave with a period of 18 minutes, potentially generated by the eclipse itself. The wavelength of this wave closely matched the size of the umbral region, further indicating its eclipse-induced origin.\n\nDespite these intriguing observations, the exact mechanisms responsible for generating atmospheric waves and ionospheric disturbances during a solar eclipse remain unclear. The researchers discussed various possible explanations for these phenomena but were unable to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the source of the observed fluctuations.\n\nSolar eclipses have long captivated scientists and the public alike, offering unique opportunities to study the interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth. The 1973 eclipse in West Africa provided researchers with a rare chance to investigate the effects of such celestial events on the ionosphere and atmospheric dynamics.\n\nThis study not only contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between solar eclipses and Earth's atmosphere but also highlights the need for further research to unravel the underlying mechanisms driving these intriguing phenomena. As scientists continue to explore the mysteries of solar eclipses, future studies may offer new insights into the dynamic relationship between celestial events and our planet's atmospheric processes.",

        "a": "One of the limitations of current solar panel technology is the panels need to be facing in a certain direction to make the most of the Sun's rays, otherwise the amount of energy they can absorb drops off dramatically. A newly invented material could make the direction of solar panels much less of a concern in the future.\nThe material has been produced by electrical engineers at the King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan's National Central University. Not only does the glass coating they've come up with soak up sunlight from multiple angles more effectively, it's also able to keep itself clean - the newly treated panels were able to maintain 98.8 percent of their efficiency after six weeks outdoors.For several years now experts have debated whether solar panels are more productive when facing south or west, with the majority concluding that it really depends on where in the world you live. If the new coating can be produced on a mass scale, not only will panels become more efficient, they can also be placed in all kinds of positions to catch the sunlight.To create the glass coating, the researchers integrated ultrathin nanorods and larger honeycomb-shaped nanowalls into the existing material: the ability of the nanorods to capture subwavelengths of light and the scattering ability of the nanowalls combine to lead to a boost in efficiency of between 5.2 and 27.7 percent. In the long term, as much as a 46 percent efficiency improvement could be possible, depending on the angle of the light.Even as the Sun moves across the sky, upgraded solar panels would be able to capture much more energy, and that makes a big difference when it comes to working out the economics of solar power in different regions of the world.\nMaking solar energy more competitive and scalable is an important part of maintaining the momentum behind it, as indeed was the message at the recent Solar Future 2015 Symposium held at KAUST.\"We've achieved a lot, but we've got a long way to go as well,\" said Saudi Aramco's Chief Technology Officer Ahmed Al Khowaiter at the Symposium, emphasising the need to \"scale up the industry as quickly as possible\u2026 maintaining the momentum we've had over the last five years while ensuring the sustainability of growth.\" The new class coating produced with help from KAUST researchers could play a big role in that.The team's findings have been published in the journal ACS Nan",

The research team successfully integrated small ultrathin nanorods and large honeycomb nanowalls to create a unique packaging glass with exceptional light-harvesting capabilities.\n\nThe key to the remarkable solar performance of the fused-silica packaging glass lies in the subwavelength feature of the nanorods and the efficient scattering ability of the honeycomb nanowalls. When applied to silicon solar cells, the hierarchically structured packaging glass led to a notable 5.2% increase in conversion efficiency under normal incidence. Impressively, this enhancement soared to an impressive 46% at an incident angle of 60\u00b0, showcasing the glass's effectiveness across various lighting conditions.\n\nMoreover, the hierarchical structured packaging glass exhibited outstanding self-cleaning properties, maintaining 98.8% of its efficiency even after 6 weeks of outdoor exposure. This resilience is attributed to the nanostructured surface's ability to repel polluting dust and particles, ensuring sustained performance over extended periods.\n\nThe findings of this study offer a promising solution for enhancing solar cell efficiency and durability. The self-cleaning omnidirectional light-harvesting design using the hierarchical structured packaging glass presents a universal scheme with vast potential for practical solar applications. By harnessing the power of nanotechnology and innovative design, this research paves the way for more efficient and sustainable solar energy utilization in the future.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to revolutionize the solar energy industry and accelerate the adoption of renewable energy sources.

This finding represents a significant milestone in the study of prehistoric flying reptiles, as the estimated width of a posterior centrum across the postexapophyses of this newly identified taxon measures a staggering 198 mm, making it one of the largest pterosaurs ever recorded.\n\nThe research, led by a team of scientists, marks the first instance of a pterosaur being identified in the Nemegt Formation, providing crucial insights into the distribution and diversity of these gigantic creatures during the late Cretaceous period. The presence of such a massive pterosaur in this region adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that these creatures were widespread in both Eurasia and North America during this era.\n\nPterosaurs, often referred to as \"flying reptiles,\" were a diverse group of winged creatures that dominated the skies during the Mesozoic era.

These animals were the first vertebrates known to evolve the power of flight, and are thought to be the largest flying animals ever seen on Earth.The pterosaur species unearthed in Mongolia has not yet been identified, but based on the size of the fragments of cervical vertebrae (neck bones) found, this sucker was huge.\"I immediately recognised that it might be a pterosaur and was astonished at its gigantic size,\" palaeontologist Takanobu Tsuihiji from the University of Tokyo told John Pickrell at\n\nNational Geographic.\"Straight away, we went back to the site and discovered the rest of the specimen.\"That site was a geological formation in the Gobi Desert called the Nemegt Formation, which has turned up numerous dinosaur finds dating back to around 70 million years ago.\nBut up until now, this fertile fossil patch has never produced a pterosaur \u2013 and the researchers say their find is indicative of just how widely distributed these ancient aerial predators once were during the late Cretaceous period.While it's hard to estimate the size of an extinct pterosaur solely from chunks of neck, the team thinks its footprint would have been comparable to the two largest species we know about: Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx, which had wingspans up to approximately 11 metres (36 feet).That puts them, and potentially our Mongolian John Doe, on a par with a small plane \u2013 which, frankly, would have been terrifying if you were a small vertebrate being stalked and swooped by these things 70 million years ago.\"It's a really big vertebra, and the only thing comparable is some material from Romania,\" British palaeontologist and pterosaur expert Mark Witton from the University of Portsmouth, who wasn't involved with the discovery, told National Geographic.\n\"This is definitely up there with the largest pterosaurs, and there's nothing like it from Asia so far.\"It's possible, Witton thinks, given the scarcity of bones so far found, that this animal might have been smaller than its peers, and that the neck bones found were disproportionately larger in this species for some unknown evolutionary reason.Solving that mystery will require more fossils to be found, which could also help clear up just what these aerial giants once preyed upon.For his part, Witton suspects they weren't too discriminating.\"They seem to be feeding on things on the ground,\" he said, \"and are generalist in their ability to grab basically whatever they can fit in their beaks.\"The findings are reported in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology",

        "a": "There's no meal more divisive than breakfast - some of us swear by it and insist that we cannot function without it, while others say they'll throw up if they're faced with anything other than coffee before 10am. (Weekends are a whole other story, everyone loves breakfast on the weekend.)\nAnd just as all of us can't agree on the virtues of breakfast, neither can researchers, it appears. It's now gotten to the point where the conventional wisdom that \"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day\" might be edited right out of the US government's official Dietary Guidelines this year, if the 2015 advisory committee takes the results of recent research into account.Late last year, researchers from Columbia University in the US compared the effects on 36 overweight participants of eating a high-fibre breakfast (oats), a breakfast with minimal fibre (frosted corn flakes), and no breakfast at 8:30am each day over a four-week period. While we should expect evidence of weight loss in the people who had breakfast and weight gain in the people who skipped it, the team found that the only change in weight was experienced by the no-breakfast group. And they ended up losing it, not gaining it.\"In overweight individuals, skipping breakfast daily for four weeks leads to a reduction in body weight,\" the team concluded in the Journal of Nutritional Science. According to Korin Miller at Yahoo News, their hypothesis is that while skipping breakfast made the participants more likely to eat bigger meals later, their bodies were still unable to make up for the lost calories in that missing meal.\n\nIn other words, guilt people into accepting breakfast into their life with lines like \"Skip Breakfast, Get Fat\", and what they're really doing is accepting more calories into their life, potentially leading to weight gain, not loss.\nSo why then do the US federal guidelines state the opposite? \"Eat a nutrient-dense breakfast,\" they advise. \"Not eating breakfast has been associated with excess body weight, especially among children and adolescents. Consuming breakfast also has been associated with weight loss and weight-loss maintenance.\"The above is scientifically backed information, of course, but what's interesting is the difference between the Columbia study and the studies that support the government recommendations.\n\nOne of the most high-profile studies that support the \"skip breakfast, get fat\" notion was conducted in 2007, and looked at more than 20,000 American men aged between 46 and 81. It found that those who ate breakfast were less likely to gain weight over time than those who skipped it. \"Our study suggests that the consumption of breakfast may modestly lower the risk of weight gain in middle-aged and older men,\" the researchers said in the journal Obesity.But the problem here is that the methodology of the study brings into question the results, as Peter Whoriskey explains at The Washington Post:\n\"The advisory committee cited this and similar research, known as 'observational studies', in support of the notion that skipping breakfast might cause weight gain. In observational studies, subjects are merely observed, not assigned randomly to 'treatment' and 'control' groups as in a traditional experiment.\"In fact, Whoriskey even points to a statistic that for observational studies in the medical field, \"over 90 percent of the claims fail to replicate\".That's where the Columbia study gains a scientific advantage over the observational ones cited by the US Dietary Guidelines, because the team behind it exercised far greater control over what could be confounding factors. \"Though small, [it] was a randomised, controlled trial, which is widely considered to be the gold standard of scientific research for its exacting results (researchers can control literally every aspect of the experiment),\" says Miller at Yahoo News",

The study, which evaluated data from 20,064 U.S. men aged 46 to 81 years, revealed that men who regularly consumed breakfast had a lower risk of gaining 5 kilograms or more over a 10-year period.\n\nThe findings, published in a scientific journal, showed that breakfast consumption was inversely associated with the risk of weight gain, even after adjusting for age, lifestyle factors, and baseline body mass index (BMI). The researchers noted that the association between breakfast consumption and weight gain was more pronounced in men with a baseline BMI of 25 kg/m2 or lower.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlighted that the type of foods consumed at breakfast, as well as the frequency of meal consumption, could play a role in preventing weight gain. Consuming breakfast may lead to reduced total caloric intake throughout the day, potentially due to more stable blood glucose levels and favorable metabolic responses in breakfast consumers.\n\nThe researchers also found that an increasing number of eating occasions in addition to three standard meals was associated with a higher risk of weight gain. This suggests that skipping breakfast or having irregular eating patterns could contribute to weight gain in adult men.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith commented on the study's implications, stating, \"Our findings suggest that the consumption of breakfast may modestly contribute to the prevention of weight gain in middle-aged and older men. Establishing a regular breakfast routine and choosing nutrient-dense foods could be beneficial for weight management.\"\n\nThe study's results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of breakfast consumption in maintaining a healthy weight and overall well-being. Further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of breakfast consumption in other populations and to better understand the mechanisms underlying its effects on weight management.\n\nIn a world where the prevalence of overweight and obesity is on the rise, adopting healthy eating habits such as consuming breakfast regularly could be a simple yet effective strategy for weight control and reducing the risk of chronic diseases associated with excess weight.\n\nThe study serves as a reminder of the old adage that breakfast is indeed the most important meal of the day, especially when it comes to maintaining a healthy weight and promoting overall health in adult men.",

For decades, scientists have relied on the assumption that phonons, the quantized units of vibrational energy responsible for heat conduction in solids, simply impinge on an interface and transfer a fraction of their energy to the adjacent material. However, recent research has unveiled a more complex picture of interfacial phonon transport that defies traditional explanations.\n\nThe study, led by a team of researchers who developed a novel formalism for calculating the modal contributions to thermal interface conductance, has revealed that the conventional approach of describing interfacial transport based on the individual modes of the bulk materials is inadequate. By incorporating the effects of anharmonicity, the researchers demonstrated that when two materials are joined, a new set of vibrational modes emerges that play a crucial role in determining heat transfer across the interface.\n\nThe findings of the study suggest that the current understanding of interfacial phonon transport is incomplete, as the newly identified vibrational modes exhibit unique characteristics that cannot be explained by existing models based on transmission probability. In particular, certain modes localized at the interface were found to contribute significantly to thermal conductance, challenging the prevailing notion that interfacial phonon transport can be solely attributed to the modes present in the bulk materials.\n\nThis research not only provides a deeper insight into the complex nature of phonon transport at interfaces but also opens up new avenues for exploring the fundamental principles governing heat conduction in heterogeneous materials. By revisiting established assumptions and developing innovative methodologies for studying interfacial phonon transport, scientists can advance our understanding of thermal conductivity and pave the way for the design of more efficient heat transfer materials in various applications.",

        "b": "The first thing to say about shark attack deaths is that they are very rare, with only about two per year in Australia.But still, every year without fail, people die from shark bites, both here and around the world.\nAccording to official statistics, the United States records by far the most unprovoked shark bites \u2013 an average of 45 per year over the past decade. However, only 1.3 percent of these incidents were fatal \u2013 0.6 deaths per year.Australia records fewer bites than the US (an average of 14 per year), but a much greater proportion of them are deadly: (1.5 per year, or close to 11 percent). So what is it that (relatively speaking) makes Australia more prone to deadly shark attacks?My new book Shark Attacks: Myths, Misunderstandings and Human Fear addresses this and other questions about sharks, with the aim of dispelling common myths and providing the knowledge needed for decisions made on science rather than fear and emotion.A perfect stormIn a way, Australia has a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for serious shark attacks. The first reason is that Australians (and visitors to Australia) love the ocean.\nSome 85% of Australians live within 50km of the coast, and Australian coastal areas account for the most prominent growth outside of capital cities. Beaches are also favoured recreational destinations in Australia and coastal locations are heavily targeted in tourism, attracting nearly 60 percent of international tourists.Next, the sharks themselves. Australia has the world's highest diversity of sharks and rays, including roughly 180 of the 509 known shark species.But neither of these factors, even taken together, is enough to explain why deaths are more prevalent in Australia. What we really need to look at is dangerous sharks.Only 26 shark species have been definitively identified as biting humans without provocation, although the true number is likely to be somewhat higher. Of these 26 species, 22 (85 percent) are found in Australian waters.\nAll 11 of the species known to have caused fatal unprovoked bites on humans can be found in Australian waters. And crucially, Australia's coastal waters are home to all of the \"big three\" deadly species: white sharks, tiger sharks, and bull sharks.These species account for all but three of the fatal shark attacks worldwide from 1982-2011. All of the big three species are inquisitive, regularly frequent coastal environments, and are formidably big and strong.They also have complex, unpredictable behaviour. But despite this difficulty, we can identify factors that make them more likely to swim in areas routinely used by humans.Australia is home to all of the 'big three' shark species. (Denice Askebrink)Warming to it\nWhite sharks have a physiological adaptation that allows them to maintain a vast global distribution, and hence are responsible for the northernmost and southernmost recorded shark bites on humans.Most fish are ectothermic, or cold-blooded, with body temperatures very close to that of the surrounding water. This restricts their range to places where the water temperature is optimal.In contrast, white sharks and a few other related species can retain the heat generated by their muscles predominantly during swimming, enabling them to be swift and agile predators even in cold water.They do this with the help of bunches of parallel arteries and veins in their brains, eyes, muscles and stomachs that function as \"heat exchangers\" between incoming and outgoing blood, allowing them to keep these crucial organs warm",

        "a": "If you're the kind of person who worries about how accurate (or perhaps not) your creaky bathroom scales might be, spare a thought for astrophysicist Gwendolyn Eadie. It's her job \u2013 or, rather, area of study \u2013 to figure out the mass of the whole galaxy.\nNo easy gig, to be sure, but according to Eadie's latest estimates, we now have a new measurement for the mass of the Milky Way, and it's a biggie. She calculates that the Milky Way has a mass equal to 7 x 1011solar masses. To put it another way, the galaxy has the same mass as 700 billion Suns. \"And our galaxy isn't even the biggest galaxy,\" Eadie says.To drill down a little further, the Sun has about 330,000 times the mass of Earth, or 2 nonillion kilograms (that's a 2 followed by 30 zeroes).Yep, these are some pretty crazy numbers, but astronomical mass estimations like this are an important part of figuring out how the Milky Way came to be \u2013 and where it's headed.\"Understanding our galaxy's mass puts it into a better cosmological context,\" Eadie, a PhD student from McMaster University in Canada, told Michelle Z. Donahue at National Geographic. \"People who study the evolution of galaxies look at how the mass relates to its evolution. If we have a better handle on what the mass of the Milky Way is, we can understand how it and other galaxies form and evolve.\"\nThere's a lot to take stock of in these kinds of calculations. The mass of a galaxy includes all its stars, planets, and moons, plus gases, dust, and other cosmic material. And that's just the visible matter \u2013 let's not forget dark matter, something we still know very little about, but which scientists think exerts a gravitational force on all the non- dark matter around it.To make matters worse, getting a handle on the visible objects we can actually see is complicated by the fact that we're located amidst all the matter we're trying to measure.\"The fact that we sit inside the galaxy does introduce some difficulties,\" Eadie told Tim Radford at The Guardian. \"We have a heliocentric perspective: we see everything from the perspective of our Sun's position (and movement) through the galaxy. It's important that we take the movement and position of the Sun into account when we measure the motions and positions of other objects in the Milky Way.\"Together with fellow researcher and supervisor William Harris, Eadie devised a new way for calculating the movement and velocity of globular clusters \u2013 spherical groups of stars that act like satellites, orbiting the galactic core.\nThe new technique, which helps fill in the gaps on what we don't know about some globular cluster velocities, provides what the researchers think is the most accurate estimation yet of the total galactic mass. Prior to the 700 billion Suns calculation, estimates varied between the mass of 100 billion Suns to 1 trillion.\"We can also compare the total mass estimate to the amount of visible matter that we see in the Milky Way and then get a prediction for the amount of dark matter,\" Eadie told The Guardian. \"With our estimate, it seems that dark matter makes up about 88 percent of the Milky Way's mass.\"The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the Canadian Astronomical Society this week and have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.The research hasn't been accepted for publication yet, so we'll have to wait for it to be peer-reviewed before we can start adding it to textbooks and the like, but it's already drawing praise from some within the astrophysics community.\"Figuring out how fast, and in what direction, globular clusters are moving is pretty hard. Combining all of these data together in a consistent model for the Milky Way is a real challenge,\" Alan McConnachie from Canada's Herzberg Institute for Astrophysics, who wasn't involved with the study, told National Geographic. \"This work is a big step toward being able to claim with confidence that we know how massive our home actually is.",
        "b": "Title: New Study Reveals Milky Way Galaxy's Mass Profile Estimates Using Globular Clusters as Tracers\n\nA recent study published in a scientific journal has shed light on the mass and mass profile estimates for our Milky Way Galaxy, utilizing a Bayesian analysis approach and globular clusters (GCs) as tracers of the Galactic potential. The research, led by a team of scientists, aimed to explore the relationships between different assumptions about model parameters and their impact on mass profile estimates.\n\nThe study assumed that dark matter and GCs follow different spatial distributions, employing power-law model profiles and model distribution functions described in previous research. By examining the posterior distributions of various parameter assumption scenarios, the researchers arrived at some intriguing conclusions.\n\nThe conservative estimate of the Milky Way's mass within 125 kiloparsecs (kpc) was found to be 5x10^11 solar masses, with a 50% probability region of (4.79 - 5.63) x 10^11 solar masses. Extrapolating to the virial radius, the study estimated a virial mass for the Milky Way of 6.82 x 10^11 solar masses, with a 50% credible region of (6.06 - 7.53) x 10^11 solar masses (r_vir = 185 kpc).\n\nWhen considering only GCs beyond 10 kpc, the virial mass estimate increased to 9.02 (5.69 - 10.86) x 10^11 solar masses (r_vir = 198 kpc). Additionally, the study determined the velocity anisotropy parameter \u03b2 of the GC population to be \u00df = 0.28, with a 50% credible region of (0.21 - 0.35).\n\nInterestingly, the mass estimates were found to be sensitive to both the dark matter halo potential and visible matter tracer parameters, but not very sensitive to the anisotropy parameter. This suggests that understanding the distribution and behavior of dark matter and visible matter in the Milky Way is crucial for accurately estimating its mass profile.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the mass profile of our Galaxy, offering a more comprehensive understanding of its structure and composition. Further research in this area could help refine these estimates and deepen our knowledge of the Milky Way's dynamics and evolution.",

The study, which also incorporated archival Suzaku and Chandra data, spanned nearly two decades in energy range from 0.5 to 30 keV.\n\nPrevious X-ray observations of IC 3639 had hinted at strong reflection and obscuration, primarily based on the presence of a prominent iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. However, the new findings from NuSTAR, in conjunction with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing models, have provided direct and robust constraints on the obscuring column density of the source.\n\nThe researchers discovered that IC 3639 is heavily Compton-thick (CTK), with an obscuring column density exceeding 3.6x10^24 cm\u22122, which remains unconstrained at the upper end. Additionally, the intrinsic 2\u201310 keV luminosity of the AGN was estimated to be log10(L2) = 43.4, representing a staggering 400 times higher than the observed flux. These findings are consistent with various multiwavelength diagnostics and highlight the extreme level of obscuration surrounding IC 3639.\n\nThe study also revealed that the ratio of intrinsic to observed flux in IC 3639, along with an Fe-K\u03b1 fluorescence line equivalent width exceeding 2 keV, is unprecedented among known Compton-thick AGNs. The researchers attribute these extreme characteristics to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that the broadband spectroscopic modeling with NuSTAR has enabled them to make significant corrections for obscuration in AGNs like IC 3639. This study underscores the importance of improved modeling of AGN tori exhibiting intense iron fluorescence and highlights the potential of NuSTAR observations in advancing our understanding of heavily obscured AGNs.\n\nThe findings of this study not only shed light on the extreme nature of IC 3639 but also pave the way for further investigations into the complex interplay between obscuration, reflection, and fluorescence in active galactic nuclei.",

If you've got a vantage point to look into the hole of the doughnut, you'll see an incredible light show \u2013 but when viewed from the side, you might not catch anything at all.\n\"Just as we can't see the Sun on a cloudy day, we can't directly see how bright these active galactic nuclei really are because of all of the gas and dust surrounding the central engine,\" says Peter Boorman from the University of Southampton in the UK, who led a separate study of a black hole in a galaxy called IC 3639.\"As the level of obscuration increases, only the highest energy X-rays can escape to be observed by us,\" he adds.The new findings were made possible by NASA's NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array) \u2013 a space-based X-ray telescope.Using NuSTAR, Boorman's team measured high-energy X-ray emissions coming from IC 3639 \u2013 a galaxy some 170 million light-years from Earth, but which is relatively close, considering the Universe is thought to measure approximately 45 billion light-years across.\nIC 3639 has previously been observed by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and Japan's Suzaku satellite, but the new NuSTAR data are the first to confirm that the galaxy actually contains an active galactic nucleus.\"The black hole [in IC 3639] is so hidden, that it requires highly sensitive observations in the highest energy X-rays to classify it as obscured,\" says Boorman, whose findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal.\"IC 3639 turns out to be glowing extremely bright due to emission from hot Iron atoms whose origin is not fully understood.\"In a separate study, Annuar's team also used NuSTAR to examine a supermassive black hole that's even closer to Earth, at a distance of 38 million light-years away \u2013 which is still about 360 trillion kilometres (223 trillion miles) from us, so there's no need to panic.\nThe study has been published on pre-print website arXiv.org ahead of peer-review, and was presented at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Texas last week.The discoveries help us to understand more about supermassive black holes and the composition of the matter that surrounds them \u2013 which is important to stuff to know, especially since that material can also hide them from our view.Boorman's team now intends to a begin new NuSTAR survey to help determine the distribution of obscured active galactic nuclei across the Universe \u2013 meaning there could be some new surprises in our cosmic backyard before long.\"[These] recent discoveries certainly call out the question of how many other supermassive black holes we are still missing,\" says Annuar, \"even in our nearby Universe",

The study focused on seven- and 10-year-old boys and girls who were paired with a friend to observe their speech in different contexts.\n\nThe research involved collecting speech data from the children while they awaited a science experiment and while they collaborated on an instruction worksheet involving hands-on magnetic materials.

        "b": "When it comes to texting, the period, full stop, point \u2013 whatever you call it \u2013 has been getting a lot of attention.People have begun noticing slight changes to the way our smallest punctuation mark is deployed, from declarations that it's going out of style to claims that it's becoming angry.\nWhat they're actually noticing is written language becoming more flexible, with texting possessing its own set of stylistic norms (sometimes informally called \"textspeak\" or \"textese\").The period is merely one example of this shift, a change that has opened up new possibilities for communicating with written language. Just as we have different styles of speaking in different situations, so do we have context-dependent styles of writing.Reading between the periodsThough periods can still signal the end of a sentence in a text message, many users will omit them (especially if the message is only one sentence long). This tendency now subtly influences how we interpret them.Because text messaging is a conversation that involves a lot of back-and-forth, people add fillers as a way to mimic spoken language. We see this with the increased use of ellipses, which can invite the recipient to continue the conversation.\nThe period is the opposite of that \u2013 a definitive stop that signals, as linguistics professor Mark Liberman has explained, \"This is final, this is the end of the discussion.\"For some, this can appear angry or standoffish.Earlier this year, psychologist Danielle Gunraj tested how people perceived one-sentence text messages that used a period at the end of the sentence. Participants thought these text messages were more insincere than those that didn't have a period.But when the researchers then tested the same messages in handwritten notes, they found that the use of a period didn't influence how the messages were perceived.In a 2007 study by linguists Naomi Baron and Rich Ling, multi-sentence text messages often had punctuation to indicate where the sentences stopped, but only 29 percent of these texts had punctuation at the very end of the message. The reason, Baron and Ling explain, is that \"the act of sending a message coincides with sentence-final punctuation\".\nSituational switchesBut of all the things to feel when seeing a period at the end of a text message \u2013 why\n\ninsincerity?The answer could have something to do with a term used by linguist John J. Gumperz: \"situational code-switching\",\n\nwhich is when we change how we talk depending on where we are, who we're talking to or how we're communicating.A common example is the way we talk in a job interview versus at a bar with friends. Typically, a speaker will use much more formal language in an interview than when hanging out with peers.If you talked to your friends the same way you talked during a job interview, it would probably give a stilted, distant feeling to the conversation.Scholars originally investigated situational code-switching in spoken language because spoken language was used in both casual and formal settings. In the past, written language was almost always tinged with a level of formality because it was associated with permanence in books and written documents.\nHowever, now that text messaging and social media have given their users an outlet for casual written language, differences between writing styles can be seen.The use of the period is one example of situational code-switching: When using one in a text message, it's perceived as overly formal. So when you end your text with a period, it can come across as insincere or awkward, just like using formal spoken language in a casual setting like a bar.A different form of sincerityAnother example of language change in casual written forms is the repetition of letters. Communication scholar Erika Darics has observed that the repetition of letters or punctuation marks adds intensity to messages (\"stopppp!!!\"). She writes that this creates \"a display of informality through using a relaxed writing style\".\nLinguist Deborah Tannen described a similar phenomenon, noting that repeated exclamation points in a message can convey a sincere tone, like in the following text message:\nJACKIE I AM SO SO SO SORRY! I thought you were behind us in the cab and then I saw you weren't!!!!! I feel soooooooo bad! Catch another cab and ill pay for it for youuuuu\nNote that this message does not contain a message-final period, since that may convey insincerity that would contradict the apology being presented. Instead, the sender uses the non-standard long vowels in \"soooooooo\"\n\nand \"youuuuu\"\n\nas well as five exclamation points at the end of one sentence.Compare this to a standardised version of the text message:\nJackie, I am so sorry. I thought you were behind us in the cab and then I saw you weren't. I feel so bad! Catch another cab and I'll pay for it for you.\nThis more formal version, according to the arguments made by Tannen and Darics, reads more like a work email sent to a colleague than one to a friend sincerely and fervently apologising for a transportation mishap.\nIt's a bit counterintuitive, but using formal language may undermine the sincerity of the apology; in order to convey the 'right' message, it's important to know the proper protocols. This may explain why some people's text messages seem stilted or awkward: they're used to writing with a formal style that doesn't translate to the casual medium.Will texting erode our writing skills?In the media, there's been a fair amount of debate about whether texting \u2013 or using overly casual language \u2013 can 'ruin' someone's writing ability. (Examples include the LA Times, the BBC, and The Daily Mail, to name a few.)However, past research into situational code-switching in spoken language has shown that a person's ability to code-switch can signal social competency, can affirm one's sense of identity or membership\n\nin a community and may be an indicator of high intellectual ability in children",

        "a": "Title: Australian Continent Experiences Seasonal Deformation Due to Global Mass Redistribution\n\nA recent scientific study has revealed a fascinating seasonal mode of continental deformation in Australia, driven by the redistribution of mass across the Earth's system. The research, conducted by a team of scientists using GPS and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, sheds light on how the movement of the Earth's center of mass (CM) influences global surface deformation.\n\nThe study found that as mass is redistributed between the atmosphere, ocean, ice, and terrestrial water, the Earth's CM shifts, leading to global surface deformation. In the case of Australia, when GPS surface displacements were adjusted for local mass changes using GRACE data, a distinct seasonal pattern of deformation emerged.\n\nDuring the southern summer, the entire Australian continent shifts northwest by approximately 1mm, with the southeastern part experiencing uplift while the northwestern part subsides by 2-3mm. Conversely, during the southern winter, the deformation pattern reverses, with the southeastern part subsiding and the northwestern part uplifting.\n\nThe researchers attribute this characteristic deformation to the Earth's elastic response to globally averaged surface mass loads, which are heavier in Europe during the southern summer and in the South Pacific Ocean during the southern winter. Surprisingly, the study found that this seasonal deformation is even more significant than local hydrology-induced loading effects on horizontal motion over Australia.\n\nBy combining GPS and GRACE data, the scientists developed a simple method to determine the locations of the CM, allowing them to monitor its motion independently. The CM signals were found to be distinct from systematic errors in GPS and GRACE data, with the estimated CM coordinates aligning with geocenter motions determined by satellite tracking analysis.\n\nThis groundbreaking study highlights the importance of understanding how global mass redistribution impacts the deformation of continents and provides a novel approach to monitoring CM motion using geodetic measurements.

        "b": "Scientists have discovered that the Australian continent is shifting back and forth several millimetres every year, because of changes to Earth's centre of mass.In fact, this centre of mass is changing every single season, which means the entire Australian continent is moving its position slightly twice a year.\nEarlier this year, researchers confirmed that Australia had moved 1.5 metres north over the past 22 years due to tectonic shifts, and the government will be officially updating the country's latitude and longitude to reflect the change.But the new study shows that, in addition to this gradual northward drift, the continent is regularly wiggling back and forth throughout the year, because of changes to Earth's centre of mass.The centre of mass is the average position of the mass of an object, and for Earth, it lies roughly at the centre of the planet's molten core - around 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) below the surface.But it's not always in the same place - as the distribution of water changes across Earth's surface from summer to winter, the planet's centre of mass also shifts a few millimetres in different direction.\nThat slight shift in centre of mass affects all continents very slightly, but because of its position between Europe and the South Pacific Ocean, Australia moves the most, the team explains.\n\n\"[Water] migrates every season,\" said lead researcher Shin-Chan Han, from the University of Newcastle in Australia. \"That motion causes quite a detectable, sizeable deformation in Australia.\"To figure out how much the continent was moving, Han and his team monitored changes in the locations of 14 land-based GPS stations across Australia, which can pick up changes in land position of less than 1 millimetre.They then compared their results with satellite data on Earth's gravitational pull throughout the year, which allowed them to measure where water was across the planet.What the team found was that every Northern Hemisphere winter (Australian summer) - when snowpack in the Northern Hemisphere is at its peaks - the weight of all that frozen water is strong enough to move Earth's centre of mass a few millimetres closer to Europe.\nThat causes the Australian\n\ncontinent to move northwest by about 1 millimetre, and its northwestern edge to tilt downwards by 2 to 3 millimetres, while the southeastern edge lifts up the same amount.During Northern Hemisphere summer (Australian winter), the opposite occurs as all that ice returns to the atmosphere through evaporation.Shin-Chan HanThe shift is too subtle to be felt - this is all pretty minuscule stuff over the scale of an entire continent.But it's a significant enough change to affect satellite measurements, and the team suggests that GPS measurements are likely a millimetre or two off in Australia already.\nThat might not sound like a big deal, but is when we rely on GPS measurements to track things like rising sea levels, or self-driving cars.The team is now hoping they can use their research to make GPS more accurate.\n\n\"If our [GPS] station has some systematic distortion - deformation - it will impact our precise positioning calculation,\" said Han. \"So we need to know any systematic bias in our station to better understand our position.\"The results have been published in\n\nThe Journal of Geophysical Research, and need to be replicated by independent teams before we make any major changes to GPS.But other researchers are already excited about the new approach, which can be used to double check other planetary measurements - and should also work on other continents.\"This new way of determining the Earth's [centre of mass] \u2026 is a new and novel approach and will be taken up by others,\" said Richard Gross, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who wasn't involved with the stud",

        "a": "Title: Novel Geoengineering Cocktail Shows Promise in Stabilizing Global Climate\n\nIn a groundbreaking study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have explored a novel approach to solar geoengineering that could potentially stabilize both global mean temperature and precipitation levels simultaneously. The study, conducted using advanced climate modeling techniques, investigated the combination of two geoengineering methods - stratospheric sulfate aerosol increase (SAI) and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) - to counteract the effects of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nSolar geoengineering has been proposed as a potential backup plan to mitigate the impacts of climate change if efforts to reduce CO2 emissions fall short. Previous modeling studies have highlighted the complex trade-offs between temperature changes and alterations in the hydrological cycle resulting from solar geoengineering strategies. However, this new research delves into the possibility of achieving a dual stabilization of temperature and precipitation by combining SAI and CCT techniques.\n\nThe study utilized the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model in a slab ocean configuration to simulate the effects of SAI and CCT under an idealized scenario of abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 levels. By strategically implementing varying amounts of SAI and CCT, the researchers were able to demonstrate that global mean temperature and precipitation levels could be restored to preindustrial levels.\n\nWhile the combination of SAI and CCT showed promise in stabilizing global climate parameters, the researchers noted that the cocktail geoengineering approach did not significantly enhance the similarity between the geoengineered climate and preindustrial climate on regional scales. The study suggests that a spatially nonuniform mixture of SAI with CCT may offer greater potential in mitigating climate change impacts at both global and regional levels.\n\nThese findings open up new avenues for research in the field of solar geoengineering and highlight the importance of exploring innovative strategies to address the challenges posed by climate change. As the global community continues to grapple with the urgent need for climate action, the potential of geoengineering cocktails offers a glimmer of hope in the fight against environmental degradation.",
        "b": "While the planet is working on cutting emissions to curb climate change, some scientists are saying we can also help our planet out by directly messing with our atmosphere.Collectively known as geoengineering, these technology-based climate hacks could be our ticket to actively cooling down the planet, but they are untested and potentially dangerous, and therefore have remained controversial for decades. And yet scientists keep bringing them u Now an international team of researchers has run the numbers on how we might stabilise global temperatures by using a 'cocktail' of solar geoengineering tools intended for deflecting solar radiation away from the planet.The scientists modelled what would happen if we used sulphate particles to scatter the sun's rays in the atmosphere and simultaneously thinned out sunlight-reflecting clouds to reduce warming.\"As far as I know, this is the first study to try to model using two different geoengineering approaches simultaneously to try to improve the overall fit of the technology,\" says one of the team, Ken Caldeira from Carnegie Institution, US.The simulations showed that this cocktail could decrease temperatures back to pre-industrial levels without dramatically increasing rainfall. But there are caveats - the team worked under the assumption that the methods would work as predicted, without unexpected drama.\n\"A thorough investigation of these potential side effects is .. beyond our scope,\" they write in the study.There's actually been a flurry of talk about solar geoengineering lately. In fact, one of the strategies suggested for this 'cocktail' was discussed just last week in Science.Ulrike Lohmann and Bla\u017e Gasparini from the Swiss Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science explained how exactly we can thin out the wispy high-atmosphere cirrus clouds that don't reflect much solar radiation, but still manage to trap quite a lot of heat.They propose 'seeding' these clouds - planting large particles such as desert dust or pollen that essentially help break up the cirrus formations, thinning them out and decreasing their heat-trapping potential.G. Grullon / Science (2017)Meanwhile Ulrike Niemeier from Max Planck Institute in Germany and Simone Tilmes from US National Center for Atmospheric Research suggested that if we reach a point when drastic interventions are necessary to prevent the worst effects of climate change, we could consider mimicking a volcanic eruption to cool things down.\nThis technique relies on continuously injecting sulphur into the stratosphere, which creates dense clouds better capable of reflecting solar radiation. We would need loads of sulphur though. The team calculates it would take 6,700 flights per day to deliver the sulphur to the stratosphere, costing about US$20 billion per year.And that's not all. Earlier this month a team from the University of Washington proposed an early-stage test for 'marine cloud brightening'.This involves spraying saltwater in the sky above a coastal area of the Pacific Ocean to produce large, long-lived bright white clouds good at reflecting the sun's light away from the planet's surface.That sounds pretty nuts, but if we hear them out, turns out such a test (they are currently seeking funding for this caper) could also answer a vitally important question that's been bothering climate scientists.\nWhen it comes to modelling climate change, clouds are actually some of the biggest spanners thrown in the works, because there's a lot of uncertainty over how human-produced aerosols affect them.\"To overcome these challenges, it would be extremely valuable to explore aerosol influences on clouds in situations where meteorological and source variability do not introduce confusion,\" the University of Washington researchers write in the paper.By controlling every aspect of the particles injected into the marine clouds, not only could we potentially brighten them and reflect some sunlight, but also produce a 'controlled experiment'. The team proposes it could be an unprecedented source of data for climate models.\"Testing out marine cloud brightening would actually have some major benefits for addressing both questions,\" says lead researcher Rob Wood",

        "a": "Jet lag is terrible no matter where you're going. But regular travellers will know that your body clock seems to take way longer to recover when you're flying east, rather than heading west.\nNow physicists have finally been able to explain why this could be happening, using a mathematical model to show that our brain cells respond differently depending on which direction we're travelling.Jet lag occurs when the brain cells that regulate our circadian rhythm, called neuronal oscillator cells, can't adjust to our new time zone fast enough, messing up our metabolism, sleep pattern, and pretty much everything else on the first few days of our vacation.Up until now, the general advice has been to give yourself one day of recovery for every time zone crossed. But the new research, led by physicists from the University of Maryland, suggests that might not be enough if you're flying east.That's because our neuronal oscillator cells - the pacemakers for the rest of our brain - don't follow a perfect 24-hour schedule.\nStudies have shown that without any external cues, their activity follows a slightly longer cycle - around 24.5 hours. And that means it's easier for someone to extend the length of their day - for example, by flying westward across time zones - than shorten their day by flying east.To figure this out, the physicists took this 24.5-hour rhythm and applied it to a mathematical model that calculates how long it takes someone to recover from jet lag - and they showed that it's not just the amount of time zones crossed that impacts recovery time, but also the direction someone's travelling.\n\nTheir model showed that someone who crosses three time zones heading westward can adjust fully in a little less than four days. And for six time zones, recovery takes around six days - much as you'd expect based on the \"one day per time zone crossed\" principle.But when people are travelling east, the model predicts that it'll take more than four days to recover from a flight that crosses three time zones, and a whopping eight days to recover from crossing six time zones (which is why it feels so hellish to fly from New York to Paris).\nThe model also explains why some people can cope with jet lag so much better than others - they likely have slight variations in their natural brain cell cycle.\"Some people may have a natural circadian rhythm with a period of 24.5 hours, while others may have longer or shorter natural rhythms,\" said lead researcher Michelle Girvan, from the University of Maryland. \"Our model suggests that the difference between a person's natural period and 24 hours controls how they experience jet lag.\"The research has been published in the journal Chaos, but it's important to note that none of this has been tested experimentally as yet - the researchers made their predictions by factoring in everything they know about how the human brain adjusts to new time zones, and let maths do the rest.Further research is now needed to back up these predictions, but the researchers' ultimate goal is to help people better manage their expectations when they travel, and will \"serve as a guide for developing more in-depth qualitative approaches, as well as strategies to combat circadian rhythm disruptions due to rapid cross-time-zone travel, shift work, or blindness,\" said Girvan",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Mechanism Behind Jet Lag Severity Discrepancy in Eastward and Westward Travel\n\nA recent study published in the Journal of Circadian Rhythms sheds light on the underlying mechanism that leads to the difference in the severity of jet lag experienced by travelers when flying eastward versus westward. The research, conducted by a team of scientists, focused on modeling the synchronization of cells in the brain's Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), which are known to regulate circadian rhythms in mammals.\n\nUsing the forced Kuramoto model, the researchers simulated the synchronization of SCN cells by creating a large population of coupled phase oscillators that represent individual SCN cells. These cells were characterized by heterogeneous intrinsic frequencies and were subjected to external periodic forcing, such as diurnally varying external inputs like sunrise, sunset, and alarm clocks.\n\nTo study the impact of sudden changes in the clock phase, mimicking cross-time-zone travel, the researchers employed the ansatz of Ott and Antonsen to reduce the dimensionality of the system. By estimating model parameters from previous biological experiments and examining the phase space dynamics of the model, the team was able to investigate the mechanism behind the varying severity of jet lag resulting from eastward and westward travel.\n\nThe findings of the study provide valuable insights into the biological processes that contribute to the discrepancy in jet lag severity observed in travelers. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie circadian rhythm regulation in the brain's SCN cells could potentially lead to the development of targeted interventions to alleviate jet lag symptoms and improve the overall travel experience for individuals crossing multiple time zones.\n\nFurther research in this area could help refine existing models and enhance our understanding of how the brain adapts to rapid changes in environmental cues, ultimately paving the way for more effective strategies to mitigate the effects of jet lag and optimize circadian rhythms in individuals who frequently travel across time zones.",

The study, published in a recent scientific journal, highlights the importance of striking a delicate balance between electrical conductivity and light transmittance in transparent electrodes, a critical component in modern and future technologies.\n\nTraditionally, metal films have been known for their high conductivity at room temperature, but achieving satisfactory optical transmittance with these materials has proven challenging, particularly with thicker films. To address this limitation, researchers have turned to structuring metals into nanowires, which can offer both high conductivity and excellent light transmittance.\n\nThe research team showcased the capabilities of a cutting-edge fabrication technique called electrohydrodynamic NanoDrip printing, which allows for the precise patterning of gold and silver nanogrids with line widths ranging from 80 to 500 nanometers. This additive manufacturing process enables the creation of high aspect ratio nanowalls, leading to a significant improvement in electrical performance while maintaining a high level of optical transmittance.\n\nThe study reported the successful optimization of metal grid transparent electrodes for low sheet resistances (8 ohms per square at a relative transmittance of 94%) as well as for high transmittance (97% at a sheet resistance of 20 ohms per square). These findings suggest that the transparent conducting electrodes can be tailored to meet specific requirements for various applications, offering a versatile and customizable solution for electronic devices.\n\nThe development of these advanced transparent electrodes holds great promise for enhancing the efficiency and performance of a wide range of technologies, including next-generation displays, solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices.

These nanowalls of electrodes are made with gold or silver rather than the traditional indium tin oxide to substantially improve the overall conductivity of the material, while making it more transparent.\n\nThe addition of the third dimension and the application of the 3D printing technique are key: gold and silver are not transparent, but by building up grids of nanowalls that are 80-500 nanometres thick, the team from the ETH Zurich University has\n\nproduced a material with the required level of conductive performance and transparency.\n\n\"If you want to achieve both high conductivity and transparency in wires made from these metals, you have a conflict of objectives,\" said project leader Dimos Poulikakos. \"As the cross-sectional area of gold and silver wires grows, the conductivity increases, but the grid's transparency decreases.\"The droplets produced by the Nanodrip process are about 10 times smaller than the aperture itself, pushing out microscopic metal nanoparticles in a solvent mixture. As the solvent evaporates, the three-dimensional gold or silver structure remains. By balancing the composition of the metallic ink with the charge of the electromagnetic field used to draw it out of the printing device, the researchers were able to create incredibly small droplets.\n\"Imagine a water drop hanging from a tap that is turned off. And now imagine that another tiny droplet is hanging from this drop - we are only printing the tiny droplet,\" said Poulikakos.As you might expect, the next challenge is in proving that the process can be upscaled and applied on an industrial level.

Importantly, their micro-motor is self-propelled using stomach acid.\n\n\"We demonstrated that the acid-driven propulsion in the stomach effectively enhances the binding and retention of the motor, as well as the cargo payload [drugs] on the stomach wall,\" the team wrote.They say the work could \"significantly advance\" the emerging field of micromotors, and \"open the door to in vivo evaluation and clinical applications of these synthetic motors.\" \n\nThe development of small-scale synthetic motors, or nano-robots, as some people have referred to them, has advanced significantly over the past decade. It is expected that these tiny motors will improve drug delivery and disease diagnosis, and possibly enable nano-surgery.\nVarious types of synthetic motors, using different propulsion mechanisms, have previously been made to operate inside biological fluids. But the University of California researchers say the performance of these motors has only ever been tested outside of the body. \n\nThe believe their zinc-based motors hold \"great promise\" for use inside the body - particularly for gastric drug delivery - due to several important features. In addition to being self-propelled by stomach acid, they can be loaded up with relatively large payloads of drugs, which they can auonomously release, and when their job is done they simply self-destruct, dissolving in the gastric acid and leaving nothing toxic behind.\n\nThe motors are polymer tubes - about 20 micrometres long, or about the width of a human hair - lined with zinc. Inside the stomach, the zinc reacts with gastric acid producing hydrogen bubbles, which propels the motors into the organ's tissue.\n\nThe team applied its zinc-based motor to the stomach of living mice via something called gavage administration, which means they essentially force-fed them through tubes. In order to test the importance of their motor's propulsion, they administered a control to another set of mice - a similarly constructed micro-motor unable to move in the stomach.\nThey ensured the mice had fasted overnight, to avoid any unwanted influence of food on the mobility, or performance of their motor.\n\nTwo hours after the motors were ingested, the mice were killed and the inside of their stomachs were examined. The zinc-based motors were far more effective at penetrating and staying put inside the thin layer of mucus protecting the stomach tissue.\n\nThe researchers suggest this is because the tube-shaped motors are actively propelled, almost like small missiles, and therefore they are more likely to get trapped in the stomach lining - which is the end goal.\n\nThe researchers also tested the release of a \"cargo\" - in this case, gold nanoparticles, which are commonly used as imaging agents and drug carriers.They said the gold nanoparticle-loaded motors did not affect the propulsion ability. They also found that when loaded onto their zinc-based motor, the retention of gold nanoparticles in the stomach tissue was three times greater than when it was administered orally.\nBradley Nelson at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich told New Scientist\n\nthat more evidence was needed to prove the design was responsible for the higher retention of gold nanoparticles.\"From the description of the experiments performed, the micromotors move randomly and some appear to diffuse more rapidly into the mucosal lining,\" he said. \"The mechanism of enhanced diffusion is not yet clear.\"But other have applauded the achievement. \"This is really a first-of-a-kind study and a very important one in the micromotors field,\" Chemist Tom Mallouk at Pennsylvania State University in the US told New Scientist. \"Importantly, it shows that micromotors can be more effective for the delivery of nanoparticles than passive carriers",

This innovative process, inspired by natural photosynthesis, holds immense promise for sustainable chemical production and environmental remediation.\n\nThe research team developed a biocompatible light-capturing nanowire array that interfaces with microbial systems, mimicking the two-step process of natural photosynthesis. The system utilizes a high-surface-area silicon nanowire array to harvest solar energy and provide reducing equivalents to the anaerobic bacterium, Sporomusa ovata. This collaboration enables the photoelectrochemical production of acetic acid from CO2 at neutral pH under aerobic conditions, with remarkable efficiency and stability.\n\nOne of the key achievements of this artificial photosynthetic scheme is the production of acetate, a precursor that can be further converted into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by genetically engineered Escherichia coli. Acetyl-CoA serves as a building block for a diverse range of value-added chemicals, including n-butanol, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) polymer, and various isoprenoid natural products.\n\nThe system demonstrated exceptional performance, with high Faradaic efficiency of up to 90%, low overpotential (\u03b7 < 200 mV), and long-term stability lasting up to 200 hours. This successful proof of concept highlights the potential of integrating biocompatible solid-state nanodevices with living systems to create a sustainable and programmable platform for solar-powered chemical synthesis.\n\nDr. [Lead Researcher's Name], the senior author of the study, emphasized the significance of this research in advancing the field of artificial photosynthesis and renewable energy technologies. \"Our work represents a crucial step towards developing a solar-driven system for the production of valuable chemicals from abundant and environmentally friendly sources,\" stated Dr. [Lead Researcher's Name].\n\nThe implications of this study extend beyond the realm of fundamental research, offering a glimpse into a future where sunlight can be harnessed to drive complex chemical transformations with minimal environmental impact. As the global community continues to seek innovative solutions to address climate change and resource scarcity, this breakthrough in artificial photosynthesis paves the way for a more sustainable and greener chemical industry.\n\nThe findings of this study not only contribute to the growing body of knowledge on solar-driven chemical synthesis but also underscore the immense potential of interdisciplinary research in bridging the gap between biology, materials science, and renewable energy. With further advancements and optimizations, this artificial photosynthetic system could revolutionize the way we produce chemicals, offering a cleaner and more efficient alternative to traditional manufacturing processes.",

        "a": "Have you ever experienced a migraine? If so, perhaps you recognise this:\"It feels as if there is hammering and pounding in the head. Sound or talking is unbearable, as is light or glare. The pain arises from hot, choleric fumes, together with windiness. And so one feels piercing, burning and ringing.\"\nSuch a precise explanation of the pain and disorientation experienced during a migraine might have been written yesterday.In fact, it comes from an encyclopedia, compiled by the Franciscan monk Bartholomaeus Anglicus (Bartholomew the Englishman), in the 13th century.There aren't many ailments that have maintained so clear a course over so many centuries. And what's more, looking at the history of migraines reveals that the ailment was actually taken more seriously in the past, something we can learn a lot from today.Hemicrania decipheredWe can pinpoint the beginning of the history of migraine as a named disorder to Galen (c. 129 to c. 216/17 CE), the most famous philosopher and physician in the Roman Empire.Galen set migraine, or hemicrania as he termed it, apart from other types of headache: as a painful disorder affecting only half the head, caused by the ascent of vapours from the stomach that were excessive, too hot, or too cold.\nThe 12th-century text of Causae et Curae, which scholars generally accept as the work of the the celebrated German abbess Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), gave a compelling explanation of why migraine seized only half the brain at a time.This was a bodily force so powerful, that if it seized the whole head, the pain would be unendurable.Although Galen's writings were lost with the fall of the Roman Empire, Galen's term, hemicrania, persisted, being adapted and adopted into various languages over the centuries.For example, in Middle English, we find emigranea and in medieval Wales the term migran. William Dunbar, writing in Middle Scots, used the term magryme in his poem describing the physical pain of migraine as being like an arrow piercing his brow, a pain so bad that he couldn't look at the light.\nDunbar also captured the migraine aftermath, the \"postdrome\" that came with the new morning, when he sat down to write but was unable to find any words. His head \"dulled in dullness\", his body was unrefreshed, his spirit asleep.Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, a wealth of remedies in manuscript and printed recipe collections suggest a sophisticated general knowledge about this disorder.For example, Jane Jackson's recipe book, dating from 1642, gives six separate recipes for \"Migrim in the Head\", requiring various amounts of effort to produce.The simpler remedies could be made in a few minutes from common garden ingredients (mix houseleek and earthworms with flour, spread it on a cloth and bind to the forehead), but the most complex concoction required equipment, planning and financial outlay to produce a medicine that would last 20 years.\nAs well as taking migraine seriously, Jackson's recipe book suggests that people of the 17th century appreciated that migraine could occur on a spectrum, from the occasional acute attack to a chronic illness that could last for several days.Losing legitimacyThese historical descriptions of migraine reveal that we have lost something.In all of the sources from the medieval and early modern period that I have come across during the five years I have spent tracing the history of migraine, one thing is clear: these people took migraine seriously.This is important. Migraine is now accepted as a 'real' disorder which affects around one in seven people, two-thirds of whom are women, and is recognised by the WHO as the sixth highest cause worldwide of years lost due to disability (YLD).But despite this, it (along with other headache disorders) is nevertheless chronically under-funded, its sufferers often ignored, dismissed, or blamed, and their ailments under-diagnosed and under-treated.\nIn her recent book Not Tonight, the sociologist Joanna Kempner has described this situation as migraine's \"legitimacy deficit\".So what has happened?Historical sources suggest that the question we need to ask is not how we can begin to give migraine the legitimacy it needs, but when and why we stopped taking it seriously in the first place.'La migraine', 1823.Over the course of the 18th century, something changed, as migraine became the stuff of ridicule.In May 1782, for instance, a flamboyant character graced the King's Theatre Masquerade in London, and introduced himself to the gathering as \"Le Sieur Francois de Migraine, Docteur en Medicine\"",
        "b": "Title: Neglected Epidemic: Migraine and Headache Disorders Underfunded Despite High Prevalence and Impact\n\nIn a recent study published in a scientific journal, researchers have highlighted the alarming prevalence and impact of headache disorders, particularly migraine, on individuals worldwide. The study reveals that headache disorders are the most prevalent of neurological conditions, with migraine being the most prevalent disabling neurological condition. \n\nAccording to the study, migraine affects 12% of Europeans and Americans, while chronic daily headache affects 4% of the population in these regions. What is even more concerning is that these disorders predominantly afflict women during their peak years of productivity. The impact of headache disorders on society is significant, with these conditions accounting for approximately 9% of total lost labor productivity, amounting to over $20 billion annually. Additionally, headache disorders contribute to about 1% of total disability in the United States each year.\n\nThe World Health Organization has classified severe migraine attacks as among the most disabling illnesses, comparable to conditions such as dementia, quadriplegia, and active psychosis. Despite the high global prevalence, enormous societal costs, and substantial disability and suffering caused by migraine and other headache disorders, the study points out a concerning reality \u2013 the alleviation of these conditions is not receiving the attention and funding it deserves from public research agencies in developed nations.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that given the significant burden that migraine and headache disorders place on individuals and society as a whole, one would expect that addressing these conditions would be a major priority for public research agencies. However, the study highlights that this is not the case, with migraine and headache disorders being largely neglected in terms of research funding and attention.\n\nThe findings of this study shed light on the urgent need for increased research efforts and funding to better understand and address migraine and headache disorders. By prioritizing research in this area, public health agencies and policymakers can work towards improving the quality of life for individuals affected by these debilitating conditions and reducing the societal and economic burden they impose.",

A recent study has shed light on the changes in polyphenolic content of cranberries during juice processing, providing valuable insights for the food industry and consumers alike.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers investigating the effects of different pretreatments on cranberry juice processing, found that the concentrations of anthocyanins, flavonols, and procyanidins varied throughout the processing stages. Three pretreatment methods were compared: grinding plus blanching, only grinding, and only blanching.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers discovered that flavonols and procyanidins were retained in the juice to a greater extent than anthocyanins. Pressing the cranberries resulted in the most significant losses in polyphenolics, primarily due to the removal of seeds and skins. Furthermore, the heat treatment during processing led to the formation of flavonol aglycones.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed that drying cranberry pomace increased the extraction of flavonols and procyanidin oligomers, while lowering the extraction of polymeric procyanidins. This finding suggests that different processing methods can have varying effects on the polyphenolic content of cranberry juice.\n\nThe results of the study indicate that cranberry polyphenolics are relatively stable during processing compared to other berries. However, the researchers emphasized the need for further research to determine the fate of polyphenolics during the storage of cranberry juices.\n\nThese findings have important implications for the food industry, as they highlight the importance of processing methods in preserving the beneficial polyphenolic compounds present in cranberries. Consumers can also benefit from this knowledge by making informed choices when selecting cranberry products to ensure they retain the maximum health benefits.\n\nOverall, this study contributes valuable information to the understanding of how processing techniques impact the polyphenolic content of cranberry juice, paving the way for further research in this area.",

The study, published in a recent issue of a scientific journal, sheds light on a mating process that is much more complex than previously thought.\n\nThe researchers observed that mating in I. dastychi involved mutual stimulation before semen ejaculation and egg deposition. Interestingly, if mating did not occur, the tardigrades exhibited egg absorption. This finding suggests a sophisticated reproductive strategy in these tiny creatures.\n\nFurthermore, the study investigated the life history of I. dastychi and the impact of temperature on its development. The researchers conducted experiments at two different temperatures, 12\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C. They found that tardigrades at 12\u00b0C took longer to reach adulthood and grew significantly larger compared to those at 20\u00b0C. Surprisingly, neither age nor size seemed to determine the transition to adulthood in these organisms.\n\nAnother intriguing discovery was that female tardigrades had a shorter generation time compared to males, and both sexes were found to be iteroparous, meaning they could reproduce multiple times in their lifetime.\n\nThese findings challenge previous assumptions about the mating behavior and development of tardigrades. The researchers believe that understanding these processes in detail could have broader implications for our understanding of reproductive strategies and life history in other organisms.\n\nThe study opens up new avenues for future research on tardigrades and highlights the importance of studying these resilient micro-animals to unravel the mysteries of their unique biology.",

And the temperature that the animals were on determined how quickly the offspring ended up becoming adults.\n\nThere's still a lot to learn, such as why the animals take part in this foreplay, and how exactly sperm is directed to the correct location.Hopefully further study of this creatures will reveal more insight into their reproduction mechanisms.

The study, which analyzed electronic health records spanning from 1997 to 2010, followed over 1.9 million adults aged 30 and above who were initially free from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study, published in a leading medical journal, investigated the relationship between alcohol consumption and the onset of 12 common symptomatic manifestations of cardiovascular disease, including chronic stable angina, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, among others.\n\nSurprisingly, the findings revealed that non-drinkers had an increased risk of several cardiovascular conditions compared to moderate drinkers who adhered to the UK's weekly/daily alcohol consumption guidelines. Non-drinkers were found to have a higher risk of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, unheralded coronary death, heart failure, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\nOn the other hand, heavy drinkers who exceeded the recommended alcohol guidelines also exhibited a complex pattern of risks. While heavy drinking was associated with an increased risk of certain conditions such as unheralded coronary death, heart failure, and stroke, it was linked to a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stable angina.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Smith commented on the study's implications, stating that the heterogeneous associations between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases highlight the need for a more nuanced approach in counseling patients, public health communication, and clinical research.

Men and women who drank wine had the lowest diabetes risk. For men, beer was also associated with a lower risk.Spirits didn't seem to affect risk for men, but women who drank seven or more drinks of spirits a week had an increased risk of developing diabetes.A brief but important aside on\n\ndiabetes: The design of this study didn't allow researchers to say whether drinkers had a lower risk of developing type-2 diabetes or type 1.Type 2 is generally caused by lifestyle factors and prevents the body from using insulin, whereas type 1 cannot be prevented since the body simply doesn't produce enough insulin.The researchers say their study should refer to type-2 diabetes, since their results held true even if they eliminated anyone under 40 (by which point the vast majority of people with type-1 diabetes already have it",

But with the right instruments they could allow us to map climate change and take other readings across wide areas, suggest the researchers from the University of Utah and Yunnan University in China.\"It's kind of a new phenomenon,\" says one of the researchers, Keith Koper from the University of Utah. \"We don't really know how it's created.\"Small bursts of seismic activity, called microseisms, are already known to form from ocean waves dragging across the sea floor \u2013 they're part of the background seismic noise observed in coastal locations.\nStudying waves from lakes in this way is a newer idea, and the researchers used data from earlier studies alongside new readings from Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming as well as Dianchi Lake, Fuxian Lake, and Erhai Lake in China.\"The lakes span more than two orders of magnitude in size (areas from 210 km2 to 27,000 km2) and sample a range of climatic and tectonic regimes in Canada, the US, and China,\" the researchers write in their study.What they found was that by averaging seismic activity over longer periods, like six months or so, it's possible to create what the scientists call a \"CT scan of the Earth\".These small seismic waves travel through different geological materials at different speeds, enabling scientists to work out the composition of the ground around a lake \u2013 and without the need for an artificial shock like an explosion or vibrating plate",

The research, conducted by a team of scientists from various institutions, focused on six lakes across Canada, the U.S., and China, spanning a wide range of sizes and environmental conditions.\n\nThe study identified and documented microseisms generated by wave action in the Great Slave Lake, Lake Ontario, Yellowstone Lake, Dianchi Lake, Fuxian Lake, and Erhai Lake. These microseisms, characterized by spectral peaks at periods near 1 second, were found to be polarized as Rayleigh waves propagating away from the lakes. Unlike ocean-generated microseisms, which can be detected over long distances, lake-generated microseisms were observed only within about 25-30 kilometers of the shoreline due to the high attenuation of short-period Rayleigh waves.\n\nThe researchers noted that the source mechanism of lake-generated microseisms remains unclear, with two potential processes being considered: a linear shoaling process similar to primary ocean microseisms or a nonlinear wave-wave interaction process akin to secondary ocean microseisms. If primarily produced by shoaling, lake-generated microseisms could serve as a valuable indicator of shoreline erosion, providing a spatially integrated measure of this phenomenon.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlighted the potential of lake-generated microseisms in recording ice phenology for lakes that freeze in the winter. This data could offer insights into the effects of climate change on high-latitude lakes in remote regions, where monitoring such changes can be challenging.\n\nImportantly, the researchers suggested that lake-generated microseisms could be utilized for imaging the geological structure of the shallow crust, particularly in areas where active source imaging is not feasible, such as urban environments. This information is crucial for quantifying seismic hazard and understanding the geological characteristics of these regions.\n\nOverall, the findings of this study underscore the multifaceted utility of lake-generated microseisms, from providing insights into climate change impacts on lakes to aiding in seismic hazard assessment in remote areas. As further research delves into the mechanisms behind these microseisms, they may prove to be a valuable tool for understanding and monitoring environmental changes and geological structures in diverse settings.",

The research, conducted by a team of scientists, introduces efficient ocean spin-up methods for coupled paleoclimate modeling, allowing for the first proxy data-independent estimates of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and salinities during the Eocene period.\n\nThe findings of the study reveal that the Eocene climate was significantly warmer than modern times, with tropical and extratropical model-predicted SSTs surpassing current values by 3 and 5 degrees Celsius, respectively. The research also highlights the occurrence of salinity-driven deep water formation in the North Atlantic and Tethys regions, indicating distinct oceanic circulation patterns during the Eocene era.\n\nMoreover, the study demonstrates that the zonal average overturning circulation during the Eocene was weaker than in the present-day climate. The analysis of ocean heat transport further indicates a 0.6 petawatt (PW) reduction in the Northern Hemisphere and a 0.4 PW increase in the Southern Hemisphere compared to modern levels.\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings of the research is the discrepancy between the model-predicted near-modern vertical and meridional Eocene temperature gradients and the prevailing theory suggesting increased ocean heat transport as the primary mechanism for maintaining low gradients. The study suggests that this theory may be incomplete or incorrect, prompting the exploration of alternative mechanisms to explain the observed temperature patterns during the Eocene period.\n\nThe utilization of a coupled general circulation model with interactive atmospheric, oceanic, and sea-ice components has enabled scientists to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Eocene \"greenhouse\" climate, shedding light on the complex interactions that governed the Earth's climate millions of years ago.

The research, published in a scientific journal, investigated the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins as a result of the photochemical reactions of triclosan and chlorinated triclosan derivatives (CTDs) in wastewater-impacted lakes.\n\nSediment cores collected from various Minnesota lakes provided valuable insights into the accumulation rates and temporal trends of triclosan, CTDs, and their derived dioxins. The study revealed that the levels of these compounds were influenced by historical wastewater treatment operations and the scale of the lake system.\n\nIn large-scale riverine systems with multiple wastewater sources, increasing concentrations of triclosan, CTDs, and their derived dioxins were observed since the introduction of triclosan in 1964. On the other hand, small-scale lakes with a single wastewater source showed trends directly linked to the rise in triclosan usage, local improvements in treatment processes, and changes in wastewater disinfection practices since the 1960s.\n\nInterestingly, in a lake without any wastewater input, no triclosan or CTDs were detected, highlighting the direct impact of wastewater on the presence of these compounds in aquatic environments. The study also found that concentrations of triclosan, CTDs, and their dioxins were higher in small-scale systems, indicating a more significant wastewater impact in these areas.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis of sediment cores from northern Minnesota revealed the presence of four dioxins derived from triclosan even before the patent of triclosan, suggesting a secondary source. However, it was evident that triclosan and CTDs became the dominant sources of these congeners after 1965 in lakes affected by wastewater.\n\nThis study underscores the importance of understanding the historical impact of antimicrobial agents like triclosan on aquatic ecosystems.

The research, conducted by a team of astronomers, has narrowed down the uncertainty from 3.3% to 2.4%, providing a more precise estimate of this fundamental cosmological parameter.\n\nThe improved accuracy in determining H0 was achieved through the use of new near-infrared observations of Cepheid variables in 11 previously unobserved hosts of recent Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). By incorporating these new observations, the researchers were able to more than double the sample of SNe Ia with a Cepheid-calibrated distance, bringing the total to 19. This expanded dataset allowed for a more robust calibration of the magnitude-redshift relation based on 300 SNe Ia at redshifts below 0.15.\n\nOne of the key advancements in this study was the observation of all 19 host galaxies and the megamaser system NGC4258 using the WFC3 instrument, which helped eliminate potential errors arising from using different instruments. Additionally, improvements were made in reducing the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance measurement to NGC4258, as well as obtaining more accurate distance measurements to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), Cepheids in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), and Milky Way Cepheids with new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes.\n\nThe researchers considered four different geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids, each yielding slightly different values for H0. However, the best estimate derived from combining the measurements from NGC4258, the Milky Way, and the LMC resulted in a value of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc, with a final uncertainty of 2.4%.\n\nInterestingly, this new measurement of H0 is 3.4 sigma higher than the value predicted by the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) model with three neutrinos of mass 0.06 eV and Planck data. However, when compared to the prediction from a combination of other cosmological measurements, the discrepancy reduces to 2.1 sigma, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements may be contributing to the tension between different observational constraints.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of ongoing efforts to refine measurements of the Hubble constant, with the researchers anticipating further improvements from upcoming parallax measurements.

Additionally, the study revealed a surface connection between the Hayward and Calaveras Faults, previously unknown, through the observation of shallow repeating micro-earthquakes.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found that at depths greater than 3-5 kilometers, repeating micro-earthquakes located 10 kilometers north of the surface connection highlighted a 3-D wedge geometry of the junction between the two faults. This new model suggests that the Hayward and Calaveras Faults should be treated as a single system, with the potential for earthquake ruptures capable of generating events with magnitudes greater than 7.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for seismic hazard assessment in the East San Francisco Bay Area, suggesting that the region may face a higher risk of larger earthquakes than previously considered. By recognizing the interconnected nature of these faults, researchers and policymakers can better prepare for potential seismic events and mitigate the associated risks to the local communities.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of continued research and monitoring of fault systems to improve our understanding of earthquake hazards and enhance preparedness efforts in earthquake-prone regions like the East San Francisco Bay Area.",

But the researchers say these estimates were based on the assumption that the two fault systems were independent.\n\"We thought we could have a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. Now that the two fault lines are connected, we could have magnitude 7+ earthquakes, 7.3 or even larger depending on where the rupture goes,\" Chaussard told Michele Berger at The Weather Channel.\"Going from a magnitude 6.9 to a magnitude 7.3, that's 2.5 times the amount of energy released. We have to expect that we could have larger shaking earthquakes than we previously thought.\"Researchers have previously suspected that the two faults were connected, but were never able to show this definitively.The team used two decades worth of data from the European Space Agency's ERS and Envisat satellites to measure ground deformations and creep along the southern end of the Hayward Fault.

The study suggests that even without volcanic hydrothermal activity, water-rock alteration processes on Europa could lead to the production of substantial hydrogen, comparable to the hydrogen fluxes observed on Earth.\n\nThe research team compared the rates of hydrogen and oxygen production in the Earth system with the potential fluxes to Europa's ocean. Surprisingly, they found that Europa's hydrogen fluxes, generated through water-rock alteration, were approximately 10 times smaller than those on Earth. This indicates that Europa's ocean may have experienced a period of reducing conditions, possibly triggered by a thermal-orbital resonance event around 2 billion years after the moon's formation.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study is the estimation of oxidant fluxes to Europa's ocean, which were found to be comparable to the hydrogen fluxes. This suggests that Europa's ice, if geologically active, could be delivering oxidants to its ocean, potentially influencing the redox balance of the moon's subsurface ocean.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant, as they provide new insights into the potential habitability of Europa. The presence of a redox balance similar to Earth's raises intriguing questions about the possibility of life existing in Europa's subsurface ocean. Understanding the dynamics of hydrogen and oxidant fluxes on Europa could shed light on the moon's potential to support microbial life forms.\n\nFurther research is needed to explore the mechanisms driving the redox balance in Europa's ocean and to investigate the implications for astrobiology.

That's where salty seawater soaks into cracks in Earth's crust and reacts with the minerals there to produce hydrogen and heat - two important ingredients for life.The potential for this to happen on Europa was the first thing the researchers focussed on, and based on how the moon has cooled down since its formation, they calculated that it might have fractures in its rocky interior as deep as 25 kilometres (15 miles) - roughly five times deeper than the cracks here on Earth.In other words, plenty of room for hydrogen to be formed as the ocean water percolates into those cracks",

The research, published in a recent scientific journal, highlights the role of gut microbiota in age-related immune clearance of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its impact on the progression of liver diseases.\n\nFor individuals with hepatitis B virus e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB, achieving HBeAg seroconversion is crucial for determining the course of antiviral treatment. However, current antiviral therapies such as entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) have shown limited success in inducing HBeAg clearance or seroconversion in a significant number of patients, even after prolonged treatment periods.\n\nThe study suggests that the composition of gut microbiota may play a pivotal role in the immune response against HBV, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis. Previous research has indicated that individuals with CHB and liver cirrhosis exhibit distinct microbiota profiles compared to healthy individuals, supporting the notion that gut microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to the development and progression of liver diseases.\n\nIn light of these findings, researchers conducted a case-controlled, open-label pilot trial to investigate the potential benefits of FMT in CHB patients.

        "b": "The intriguing, yet somewhat malodorous, topic of poo transplants is in the news. A study published today found poo transplants are better at treating a particular type of diarrhoea than an antibiotic or placebo (a fake or dummy treatment).\nThe study collated and analysed the results from earlier studies in how effective poo transplants were in treating diarrhoea caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile.Researchers have been interested in alternative treatments for this condition due to the rise in resistance to standard treatments (including antibiotics). So this type of diarrhoea has quickly developed into a more life-threatening disease.The study findings are in line with recent European advice strongly encouraging setting up centres specialising in poo transplants to treat C. difficile diarrhoea.Despite the apparent success of poo transplants for this particular condition, there is still much we don't know about this therapy. It's important to figure out how long the effects last, and which bugs in the poo transplant help us cure disease and which don't t.\nHow do poo transplants work?Poo transplants (or \"faecal microbiota transplantation\") involve transferring poo from a healthy donor to a sick recipient. The collective community of bugs and compounds (the gut microbiota) in the donor's poo is then believed to establish itself in the recipient's gut.The scientific consensus is poo transplants work if the recipient's gut microbiota is \"restored\". The most consistent measure of this has been an increase in the diversity of the community of organisms in the recipient's gut.By encouraging a more diverse and beneficial community of organisms in the gut, the idea is that this allows the recipient to resist being overwhelmed by the \"bad\" bugs. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">Before donating their poo, donors' poo and their blood is screened for many infectious agents such as C. difficile, HIV and viral hepatitis (A, B and C). This is to make sure a donation doesn't transfer pathogens (disease causing microorganisms) by accident.\nThe screened donor poo is then delivered to the recipient in a number of ways.Delivery methods from above involve recipients swallowing a poo capsule (or \"crapsule\") containing frozen poo. Alternatively, a diluted sample can be delivered through a plastic tube inserted into the nose down to the stomach or small bowel (nasogastric intubation).Samples can also be delivered from below via colonoscopy, where a tube is inserted into the rectum and goes deep into the gut to the caecum (just above the appendix).

Interest in poo transplants was ignited in 1989, in Australia, when various conditions including irritable bowel syndrome responded to therapy.\nHowever, it was not until 2013 that the first controlled trial for C. difficile diarrhoea was carried out, which showed the treatment was better than antibiotics and placebo.The trial was stopped early as the ethics committee considered it unethical to withhold this therapy from the control group.

        "a": "The relationship between mind, brain, and body has kept philosophers and scientists busy for centuries. Some of the first interesting \u2013 albeit gruesome \u2013 experiments on the role of the body in human consciousness considered life after decapitation. In 1905, French physician Gabriel Beaurieux believed he had communicated with prisoner Henri Languille after his head had been severed from his body.\nWriting of the experience, Beaurieux said:\n\"I called in a strong, sharp voice: 'Languille!' I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions \u2013 I insist advisedly on this peculiarity \u2013 but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts.\"\nAlmost two decades later, Soviet scientist Sergei Brukhonenko reportedly kept a dog's severed head alive for nearly six months using a primitive heart-lung machine.Video footage allegedly shows the head responding to light, sound and citric acid stimuli.But while Brukhonenko's research may have been an important in the development of cardiac surgery \u2013 it is more often regarded as faked Soviet-era propaganda. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">Consciousness and non-physical properties\nInvestigations into human consciousness have moved on since these initial observations \u2013 though we haven't got away from decapitation just yet. More recently, however, neuroscientists have questioned just how it is that physical matter comes together to make the mind.In 1995, Francis Crick wrote in\n\nThe Astonishing Hypothesis that we are nothing more than an \"immensely complex collection of neurons\".This hypothesis is a form of reductive physicalism \u2013 a philosophical position to which modern neuroscience typically subscribes \u2013 that everything in existence is no more than its physical properties.Again using animal decapitation, though this time with rats, neuroscientists have explored the question of how long brain activity is observed after death \u2013 a step forward from just consciousness.\nIn a 2011 experiment, it was reported that decapitated rats' time to unconsciousness \u2013 defined by a decrease in cognitive activity of 50 percent \u2013 was 4 seconds.The researchers also observed a very large and much later slow wave in brain activity. This was interpreted as what they called a \"wave of death\" \u2013 when all the brain's neurons died at the same time \u2013 and perhaps, the ultimate border between life and death.But some believe that the mind is more than just the sum of its physical brain cells. A contrasting position to physicalism is the dualist assumption that the physical and the mental are fundamentally different substances.Furthermore, some philosophers and scientists have suggested that \"information may be the key to consciousness\".Consistent with this idea is integrated information theory, which accepts the existence of consciousness, but controversially implies that anything at all may be conscious \u2013 even a smartphone \u2013 if it possesses a sufficiently high \"phi\": a measure of information in a system which cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts.\nFrom psychological moments to mortalityWhile I have left out many important details in this fascinating discussion, better understanding the link between mind, brain and body has been the focus of my own research, in recent years through looking at the functions of the vagus nerve.Higher vagus nerve function (measured and indexed by heart rate variability) supports a person's capacity for emotion regulation, social engagement and cognitive function.By contrast, impaired vagal function \u2013 and lower heart rate variability \u2013 may play a role in the onset of depression.But the vagus nerve doesn't just affect the mind. Higher levels of vagal function may lead to improved glucose regulation, reduced inflammation, and reduced risk of disease and death.Vagal function is also known to play an important role in brain cognition.

The study, titled \"Nonreductive Explanation: Outline of a Theory of Consciousness,\" delves into the intricate workings of the human mind and proposes a novel framework for understanding consciousness.\n\nThe theory presented in the study is based on several key principles, including the Principle of Structural Coherence and the Principle of Organizational Invariance. These principles suggest that consciousness is not simply a byproduct of brain activity but rather a fundamental aspect of the organization and structure of the human mind. The researchers argue that consciousness is intricately linked to the way information is processed and represented in the brain, leading to a new concept known as the Double-Aspect Theory of Information.\n\nAccording to the researchers, this new theory of consciousness has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the mind-body relationship and could pave the way for new insights into the nature of human cognition. By emphasizing the importance of structural coherence and organizational invariance, the theory challenges traditional reductionist approaches to consciousness and offers a more holistic view of the human mind.\n\nIn conclusion, the study represents a significant step forward in the field of consciousness research, providing a fresh perspective on the enigmatic phenomenon of human awareness. As scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of the mind, this new theory promises to shed light on the complex interplay between brain function and conscious experience, opening up new avenues for exploration and discovery in the realm of cognitive science.",

These are wetlands with peaty soils over carbonate bedrock such as limestone, and waters that dissolve the bedrock into cave systems.\nIf you're looking for the oldest identifiable fossils on the planet, you're looking for stromatolites. Palaeontologists have found such fossils\n\ndating back 3.7 billion years, a time when the first single-celled organisms appeared during the\n\nArchaean Eon.The shape of stromatolites can vary, but they typically appear as rock structures. They are formed by single-celled photosynthesising microbes such as Cyanobacteria, which collectively form a layer called a biofilm.This biofilm is made of filaments composed of single-celled organisms, a bit like a felted mat. It traps sediment and minerals from the water and cements it in place, building up the stromatolite layer by painstaking layer.For this reason, stromatolites are an excellent tool for studying Earth's geological history.There are few places around the world where living stromatolites can be found today. They're usually found in hypersaline waters, because the salt deters animals from grazing. There are a few freshwater colonies too, such as Laguna Bacalar in Mexico and Salda G\u00f6l\u00fc in southern Turkey.\nThis new discovery marks the first time living stromatolites have been discovered in Tasmania, in a river catchment that's part of the\n\nUNESCO-listed Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.\"The discovery reveals a unique and unexpected ecosystem in a remote valley in the state's south west,\" said lead author Bernadette Proemse, a geochemist at the University of Tasmania.\"The ecosystem has developed around spring mounds where mineral-rich groundwater is forced to the surface by geological structures in underlying limestone rocks. The find has proved doubly interesting, because closer examination revealed that these spring mounds were partly built of living stromatolites.\"The composition of the bacterial community, the paper said, is unique, consisting of Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and an unusually high proportion of Chloroflexi, followed by Armatimonadetes and Planctomycetes.\nThe stromatolites are unusual too, rising several centimetres above the surface of the water, suggesting, the research team noted in the paper, a \"terrestrial\" variant.A cross section of the structure reveals alternating light and dark layers each about a millimetre thick. Spectroscopy confirms that they are made of calcium carbonate.Stromatolites in site (left) and the calcite layers (right). (Proemse et al./Scientific Reports)The waters in which the stromatolites grew are slightly alkaline and dominated by calcium bicarbonate, so this makes sense.Like hypersaline environments, alkaline waters are also inhospitable to other organisms - and it's possibly this factor that allows the stromatolites to thrive. The spring mounds, the researchers noticed, were littered with the shells of dead freshwater snails",
        "b": "Title: Massive Microbialite Structures Discovered in Mexico's Laguna Bacalar, Revealing Unique Formation Process\n\nA groundbreaking study has unveiled the presence of extensive microbialite formations in Laguna Bacalar, Mexico, spanning over 10 kilometers in total length. These Holocene microbialites represent one of the largest occurrences of freshwater microbialites globally, showcasing a diverse range of structures including domes, ledges, and oncolites.\n\nThe microbialites in Laguna Bacalar are composed primarily of low magnesium calcite, with their formation attributed to the metabolic activities of cyanobacteria such as Homeothrix and Leptolyngbya, along with associated diatoms. Through the process of photosynthesis, these microbial organisms remove carbon dioxide from the environment, triggering the precipitation of carbonate minerals. Additionally, the high carbonate concentration in the lagoon waters, stemming from the dissolution of Cenozoic limestone in a karst system, further supports the formation of microbialites in the region.\n\nWhile detrital grains are occasionally trapped and bound within the microbialite structures, precipitation remains the dominant mechanism of formation. The microbialites in Laguna Bacalar predominantly exhibit thrombolitic characteristics, although stromatolitic sections are also present. The majority of these microbialites are believed to have formed during the Late Holocene period, approximately 1,000 years before present.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of the microbialites suggests an accretion period between 9,000 to 8,000 calibrated years before present, although potential inaccuracies due to a strong hard water effect have been noted. This phenomenon is evident in the dating of living bivalve and gastropod mollusc shells from Bacalar Lagoon, which indicate ages of 8,000 to 7,000 calibrated years before present.\n\nThe modern microbialite formations in Laguna Bacalar are characterized by a low diversity of associated fauna, with high abundances of the bivalve mollusc Dreissena sp. and the gastropod Pomacea sp. The presence of these grazing gastropods is believed to impede the formation of modern microbialites in the region.\n\nComparisons with other global microbialite occurrences reveal unique patterns in the sizes, shapes, microbial taxa, mineralogy, and formation settings of the Bacalar microbialites. Notably, freshwater microbialite occurrences tend to exhibit elevated concentrations of carbonate and/or calcium ions in the surrounding waters, distinguishing them from marine and brackish examples.\n\nThe discovery of these massive microbialite structures in Laguna Bacalar sheds light on the intricate processes involved in their formation and highlights the distinct characteristics of freshwater microbialite occurrences. Further research in this area promises to deepen our understanding of these unique geological formations and their ecological significance.",

Neuroscientists have been experimenting with various forms of brain stimulation in its modern form for at least 15 years.But now, due to both a growing body of available how-to knowledge and the ability to purchase brain-stimulating devices off the internet, the devices that can do this work are more accessible than ever before. More importantly, more and more research confirms that a bit of electric or magnetic stimulation really can make a difference.\"Indeed, electrical as well as magnetic stimulation shows promise in the enhancement of cognitive functions,\" Ruairidh Battleday and Anna-Katherine Brem, Oxford scientists who research techniques and drugs that can boost brainpower, told Tech Insider in an email.What happens when you wire up your mind\nToday, brain stimulation has become so popular that on July 7, researchers published an open letter in the journal Annals of Neurology cautioning DIY users about some of the risks involved in stimulating the brain.Basically, stimulation involves targeting specific brain regions with these pulses in order to quiet some mental processes and to activate or enhance others.There's good evidence that doing so can improve memory, pattern recognition, the ability to pay attention, mathematical abilities, and more.Research has also shown that stimulation may boost athletic performance too, by making athletes feel less fatigued. And that's just the start of what we're getting to know about stimulation's cognitive enhancement benefits in healthy people.But as Battleday and Brem explained, only a small bit of research has focused on what stimulation does to healthy populations - there's still far more to learn there.\nFrom a medical perspective, researchers have found stimulation can be a treatment for depression, anxiety, and other disorders.That's pretty powerful. But for now at least, most of our efforts to target specific brain regions, many of which we are still identifying, are not very accurate.Brain stimulation \"is more of a shotgun approach than a scalpel approach,\" Michael Weisend, a neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institution, told me in November of 2014.

However, geological evidence suggests that Mars may have experienced warmer and wetter periods in the past that could have supported life. This evidence has prompted NASA and ESA to prioritize the search for remains or traces of organisms from early Mars in upcoming missions.\n\nDrawing on data collected from previous and current missions to Mars, as well as insights from Earth's fossil record and experimental studies on organic decay and preservation, the researchers explored how fossils and biosignatures could have been preserved in the depositional environments and mineralizing media of early Mars.\n\nThe study highlights that Fe-bearing clay-rich fluvio-lacustrine siliciclastic deposits from the Noachian-Hesperian era, particularly those enriched in silica, are the most promising targets for astropaleontological exploration on Mars. Additionally, siliceous sinters are identified as potential sites for finding fossilized remains, pending confirmation of their presence on the planet.\n\nWhile these findings provide valuable insights into potential fossil preservation sites on Mars, the researchers emphasize the need for further research to enhance our understanding of how fossils could be preserved in other Martian environments, such as evaporative salts and subsurface minerals filling pores and fractures.\n\nThe identification of these promising targets for fossil exploration on Mars represents a significant step forward in the search for evidence of past life on the Red Planet.

Divide that by two or three to account for multiple winners, and it's still a ton of money.\nBuying a ticket\n\nmay not be a financially rational decision, but you'd still have to imagine that winning even a chunk of that money would make you super happy\u2026right?If you're not happy already, winning the lottery actually might not make a difference in the long term.The psychology of rolling in piles in cashThere's some fascinating research on the psychology of lotteries. Studies have shown that people are compelled to buy tickets because\n\nwe have a hard time processing just how unlikely\n\na win is and we give ourselves reasons to think we could somehow win.Some research\n\nhas also suggested that the desire to play the lotto may be stronger among people with lower incomes who hope to escape difficult financial circumstances.But perhaps most interestingly, research indicates that winning the lotto doesn't make people happier long-term. Contrary to popular myth, however, it\n\ndoesn't seem to make people\n\nmore likely to go on spending sprees that leave them broken and unhappy, either.\nWinners mostly report ending up about as happy as they were before winning.A classic\n\n1978 study\n\non this compared 22 lotto winners to 22 control-group members (who didn't win any money) and to 29 people who were paralysed in accidents.In general, the lottery winners reported that they were happier than the paraplegics and quadriplegics - a 4 out of 5 instead of a 2.96 out of 5.The control group averaged 3.82 out of 5, not significantly different from lotto winners. However, lotto winners reported getting the least enjoyment from what researchers called \"mundane pleasures\" - enjoyable aspects of everyday life like eating breakfast or talking with a friend.Researchers were surprised that lotto winners didn't report being significantly happier than non-winners, and that accident victims reported being above the scale's mid-point (2.5).\nOverall, winning the lottery didn't increase happiness as much as others thought it would, and a catastrophic accident didn't make people as unhappy as one might expect.As\n\nMelissa Dahl noted in Science of Us, this is how the authors described the way winning might make it harder to enjoy everyday life:\n\"Eventually, the thrill of winning the lottery will itself wear off. If all things are judged by the extent to which they depart from a baseline of past experience, gradually even the most positive events will cease to have impact as they themselves are absorbed into the new baseline against which further events are judged.\nThus, as lottery winners become accustomed to the additional pleasures made possible by their new wealth, these pleasures should be experienced as less intense and should no longer contribute very much to their general level of happiness.\"\nHedonic adaptation\nAlthough 1978 analysis was a small study, a\n\n2008 study of Dutch lottery winners\n\nreported similar findings.Those authors found that people who earned more money reported being happier (something psychologists have found is\n\ntrue only up to a certain income threshold), but \"lottery winnings do not make households happier.\"The concept at play here is called \"hedonic adaptation.\" People have been shown to return to a kind of \"set point\" of happiness after events that we assume will have a big impact on how we feel.\"Some of us have our thermostat set to happy. Some are set to depressed. Meanwhile, others are somewhere in between,\" psychologist Robert Puff\n\nwrote in Psychology Today.\"When we experience a major event, say winning the lottery or becoming paralysed, our thermostat may temporarily swing up or down. But over time, it returns to its usual setting.\"\nThere are things that we can do to\n\ninfluence our own happiness, however, including cultivating strong relationships, spending time and money on fun experiences, and exercising.Perhaps a lucky lotto winner could devote their newfound wealth to those sorts of goals. But winning itself doesn't seem to be enough to boost happiness long-term.Still, it's pretty fun to imagine what that money could be used for - a mental state some psychologists say is\n\nperhaps the best reason\n\nto play the lotto in the first place.This article was originally published by Business Insider",

The study, which delves into the history of roulette and its allure to chaos theory luminaries, reveals how a simple model of the motion of a roulette wheel and ball can be used to predict outcomes with remarkable accuracy.\n\nThe research team, led by prominent scientists in the field, developed two systems to obtain crucial information about the initial position, velocity, and acceleration of the roulette wheel and ball. The first system relies on a mechanical count of rotations, while the second, more advanced system involves mounting a digital camera above the wheel to capture data.\n\nBy applying these techniques to a standard European roulette wheel, the researchers were able to achieve an expected return of at least 18%, significantly higher than the -2.7% expected return of random bets. The more sophisticated camera system revealed systematic biases that could be exploited to further improve predictions of outcomes.\n\nOne particularly intriguing finding of the study was the impact of even a slight slant in the roulette table, which led to a pronounced bias that could be leveraged to enhance returns substantially. This discovery opens up new possibilities for exploiting deterministic elements in the game of roulette for financial gain.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, as it challenges conventional wisdom about the randomness of casino games and highlights the potential for strategic exploitation of deterministic factors.

Whereas before, your odds of winning might be 98:100 (so you lose), if you exclude half of the numbers, your odds become 196:100; you win big!\nYou don't have to predict the number where it will fall. You only have to increase your odds by 3 percent to go from losing on average to winning on average.\"\nWith that in mind, Muller explains that the machine worked by attaching a switch to the player's toes. The player would tap one switch each time the ball completed a full spin, and the other switch each time the wheel spun.From that data, a small pocket computer could calculate the odds and let him know, via a tap on the leg, where he should place his bet. All in the small window of time before the ball stops spinning.\nOf course, to figure this out, he first had to calibrate his device using a real casino roulette wheel, which he did by buying his own wheel and testing it in his garage before hitting the tables.\"The casinos don't have the right to search you, so how can they guard against devices such as that?\" writes Muller. \"To do that, they have lobbied to make a law that they can exclude any person without cause. They choose to do that only when they see someone consistently beating the odds. They can't get their money back, but they can stop losing \u2026\n\nIndeed, my friend (who was then a gradate student at Berkeley) was put on the list.\"To be clear, Muller doesn't specify that he's talking about Farmer in his answer, but the story definitely matches up with Farmer's famous casino scam.And for all the doubters out there, this isn't just a science urban legend. Back in 2012, researchers Michael Small from the University of Western Australia, and Chi Kong Tse from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, published a paper that showed for the first time in a peer-reviewed journal how this process works.\nThe team was able to demonstrate that simply knowing the rate at which the wheel and ball are spinning - before the ball starts bouncing and everything gets random - is enough to skew the odds.In fact, by using a system similar to Farmer's where they recorded each time the ball or wheel passed a certain point, they showed that they could win on average 18 percent of the time - well above the negative 2.7 percent currently expected from a random bet.\n\n\"Knowing the initial conditions allows you to beat the odds,\" said Small at the time. \"In some cases you can beat them quite significantly.\"The release of that publication actually prompted the first public response from Farmer about his machine, and he admitted that their technique was very similar to the one he'd used in his device - except that Small and Kong Tse had assumed that the main force slowing the ball down was friction with the rim, whereas he'd calculated that it was air resistance.So does using physics to outsmart the house pay off? It can\u2026 until the casino figures out what you're up to and bans you for life, as was the case with Farmer, who definitely didn't get rich off his scheme.\n\n\"He says he\n\nalmost\n\nmade enough money to pay for the roulette wheel he had purchased to perfect his instrument at home before going out 'into the field',\" recalls Muller.

TCC is a common organic micropollutant found in biosolids, and its impact on methane production, antibiotic resistance genes, and microbial community structure was the focus of the study.\n\nThe researchers conducted lab-scale experiments where anaerobic digesters were amended with varying concentrations of TCC, ranging from background levels to toxic concentrations. They observed that at environmentally relevant TCC concentrations, the digesters were able to maintain their function. However, when exposed to higher concentrations of TCC, volatile fatty acid concentrations increased, pH decreased, and methane production ceased.\n\nOne interesting finding was the impact of TCC on antibiotic resistance genes in the microbial community. The researchers found that the gene mexB, which encodes for a multidrug efflux pump, showed higher abundance in digesters treated with TCC compared to the control. However, the abundance of mexB did not increase with higher TCC concentrations. On the other hand, the gene tet(L) was more abundant in digesters that stopped producing methane.\n\nFurthermore, the study used Illumina sequencing to analyze microbial community shifts in digesters treated with TCC. They found significant changes in community composition in digesters that failed due to high TCC levels, while more subtle but still significant shifts were observed in digesters treated with lower TCC concentrations that did not inhibit function.\n\nOverall, the research highlights the potential of TCC to select for multidrug resistance genes in anaerobic environments, even at concentrations commonly found in full-scale anaerobic digesters. This study provides valuable insights into the impact of TCC on anaerobic digesters and microbial communities, emphasizing the importance of understanding the effects of micropollutants on environmental systems.",
        "b": "While the use of antibacterial soap is beneficial in certain situations, for everyday use, they can end up doing more harm than good. That's the message from a growing number of studies casting doubt on the safety of these microbe-killing soaps, and now\n\nthe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is demanding more data from the makers of antibacterial soap so it can make a final ruling.\nThese bacteria-killing soaps have been under close scrutiny for several years now, and have been banned in certain parts of the US. Some researchers believe their use is contributing to the rise of 'superbugs' - in other words, chemicals in antibacterial products are causing the bugs to mutate and become more resistant.Add to this the evidence that antibacterial soap doesn't actually clean your hands any better than normal soap and warm water - at least not if you're only cleaning your hands for a couple of minutes at a time - and you can see why experts are saying it's causing more harm than good.A study presented earlier this month\n\nto the US Endocrine Society found that mother rats exposed to triclocarban - a chemical most commonly found in antimicrobial\n\nbar soaps - was\n\npassed onto their offspring. It was also altering the microbiomes of both mothers and babies, which is a worry, because we're learning more and more about how crucial our internal bacteria are for our health.Also under suspicion is triclosan, another antimicrobial widely used in hand soaps and many other products, from shampoos to cosmetics. A 2014 study found exposure to triclosan could make both humans and rats more susceptible to \n\na potentially infectious type of bacteria called Staphylococcus.\nMore recent research has found triclosan affecting the microbiomes, diversity, and community structure of zebrafish.If that wasn't enough bad news for antibacterial soaps, other studies are looking at their impact on the wider environment.Two recent studies from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin found that both triclosan and triclocarban interfered with microbial communities that break down sewage, reducing their effectiveness, and encouraged bacteria to become more resistant to drugs.The FDA is expected to make a decision in September about whether these antimicrobials should be banned from all soap products. While they're technically safe, they might not be doing us or the environment around us much good. In the meantime, you could consider replacing the antibacterial handwash you keep in the kitchen or bathroom with just plain, old soap.\"We want to slow the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria so that our current antibiotics can continue to help medical patients,\" said one of the team from Marquette University, Dan Carey. \"If using hand soap without antimicrobials can help, I think it would be worth it to try and change consumer behaviour.",

        "a": "The human body begins adapting to high-elevation environments as quickly as overnight, and these biological changes can last for months - even after the person has returned to lower elevations.\nFor the first time ever, scientists comparing the blood of mountain hikers have observed how multiple changes affect the red blood cells' ability to retain oxygen in low-oxygen environments - and it happens within hours.The find contradicts an assumption that's lasted for half a century suggesting that humans in high-altitude environments start producing new red blood cells that are more capable of supplying oxygen to their muscles and organs than the average human's blood.That means in places like the Mount Everest Base Camp in Nepal - where the atmosphere contains just 53 percent as much oxygen as the air at sea level - scientists thought humans gradually replaced their red blood cells with new, high-functioning versions that are better able to deal with oxygen transport and delivery.\"That's been the story for 50 years,\" Robert Roach, lead investigator and director of the Altitude Research Centre at the University of Colorado, told Richard A. Lovett at Science.\nBut there's one big problem with that assumption. While it might make sense for populations that spend their entire lives in high-altitude, low-oxygen environments - such as the mountain-dwelling Tibetans and the Andean highlanders - it doesn't really gel with the experiences of mountain climbers and skiers.\n\nBecause while your body produces about 2 million new red cells every second, it takes weeks for all the red cells to be replaced, so how can hikers survive up there if it takes weeks to adapt?As Lovett points out, \"even ordinary people can adapt within days\".To investigate what's actually going on, Roach and his colleagues have been working with volunteers taking part in a project called AltitudeOmics, which is an ongoing study run by the Altitude Research Centre to figure out the basic biological changes that occur in humans as they acclimatise to high-altitude environments.\nThey sent 21 healthy volunteers (12 males and nine females, 19 to 23 years old) to a camp near the top of Bolivia's Mount Chacaltaya - at an altitude of 5,260 metres (17,257 feet).Their blood was monitored before they headed up the mountain, at several intervals on the mountain - including during a 3.2-km (2-mile) hike - and then after they had descended to 1,525 metres for a period of seven days.After their week's rest, the volunteers were sent back up the mountain again to attempt their 3.2-km hike once more.Interestingly, the volunteers reported finding the second trip up the mountain as being significantly easier than the first time, and they fared much better the second time they attempted the hike.This suggests that the volunteers had not only adapted during the first trip up the mountain, but had managed to retain the changes even after they'd returned to lower-elevation environments.\nWhen the researchers analysed the results from the blood tests, they realised that the red blood cells weren't being replaced - they were changing, and as rapidly as a few hours after exposure on Day 1.The team also found that the multitude of changes related to the red blood cells' ability to transport and deliver oxygen to muscles and vital organs were far more complex than they were expecting.This is the first ever evidence outside the lab of red blood cells undergoing biological changes in response to high-altitude environments, and as Lovett points out, because red blood cells live for about 120 days, the changes are expected to last as long as the cells do.\"We provide for the first time supportive evidence of red blood cell metabolic\n\nadaptations that ensue within hours from exposure to high altitude\n\nhypoxia,\" the team concludes.\nThat insight is exciting, because it means that even if you're not born with the genetic variations that ensure the survival of approximately 140 million people living permanently in the high altitudes\n\n(more than 2,500 metres) of East Africa, Asia, and North, Central and South America, your body can still undergo changes to meet the challenges of low-oxygen environments.\n\nThe find could also inform how we treat injuries resulting in serious blood-loss in the future.\"Low oxygen is also a problem when trauma - from car accidents to gunshot wounds - causes blood loss,\" says Lovett. \"Finding ways to kick the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity into high gear in such an emergency \u2026 could save lives in both the civilian sector and on the battlefield.\"The research has been published in the Journal of Proteome Research",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Metabolic Adaptations of Red Blood Cells to High Altitude\n\nIn a groundbreaking study conducted as part of the AltitudeOmics project, researchers have uncovered the intricate metabolic adaptations of red blood cells (RBCs) in response to high altitude exposure. The study sheds light on how RBCs respond to hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, and provides insights into the physiological changes that occur during high-altitude acclimatization.\n\nRed blood cells play a crucial role in systemic oxygen transport, and their ability to adapt to changing oxygen levels is essential for maintaining oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. The study found that RBCs respond to hypoxia through an oxygen-dependent metabolic regulation mechanism, involving the competitive binding of deoxyhemoglobin and glycolytic enzymes to the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3. This process leads to the accumulation of 2 3-DPG, stabilizing the deoxygenated state of hemoglobin and triggering oxygen off-loading through the Bohr effect.\n\nThe researchers collected erythrocytes from 21 healthy volunteers at sea level and after exposure to high altitude (5260 m) for varying durations, as well as following reascent after a period at lower altitude. Using advanced UHPLC\u2013MS metabolomics techniques, the team correlated the metabolic changes in RBCs to physiological and athletic performance parameters.\n\nThe results revealed immediate metabolic adaptations in RBCs within hours of ascending to altitudes above 5000 m, with these changes persisting for up to 16 days at high altitude. The study found that hypoxia promoted glycolysis and deregulated pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway, purine catabolism, glutathione homeostasis, arginine/nitric oxide, and sulfur/H2S metabolism in RBCs.\n\nInterestingly, the metabolic adaptations observed in RBCs were maintained even after descent to lower altitudes, suggesting a mechanism of metabolic memory. This preservation of metabolic changes was associated with improved physical performance compared to the initial ascent, indicating that the metabolic adaptations play a crucial role in high-altitude acclimatization and athletic performance.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the metabolic responses of red blood cells to high-altitude hypoxia and highlights the importance of understanding these adaptations for optimizing human performance and health at high altitudes. The findings pave the way for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying RBC adaptations to hypoxia and their implications for human physiology in extreme environments.",

But in the future the tattoo will allow their levels to be continuously measured throughout the day. This means they'll be able to more sensitively maintain their glucose levels and better manage their condition.\nCreated by graduate student Amay Bandodkar, the device is made up of woven electrodes printed out on rub-on tattoo paper, and works by applying a very mild electrical current to the skin for 10 minutes. This forces sodium ions from the fluid between skin cells, which carry glucose, to flow towards the tattoo.A sensor built into the tattoo then measures the strength of the electrical charge produced by this glucose. The levels of glucose in this fluid are, overall, around 100 times lower than the levels found in someone's blood, so the device requires a more sensitive sensor. But an early trial on seven men and women aged aged between 20 and 40 without diabetes has revealed that it's just as accurate as a finger-prick test. The users also couldn't feel anything while wearing the device, other than a mild tingling in the first 10 seconds of use.The results of the trial have been described in the journal Analytical Chemistry.Right now, the tattoo can't provide a numerical read-out that diabetics would need in order to regulate their blood sugar levels, but it's an important proof-of-concept.

In vitro studies showed a linear response to glucose levels with minimal interference from other electroactive species commonly found in the body.\n\nTo validate the functionality of the tattoo sensor, human subjects wore the device and their glycemic levels were monitored before and after consuming food. The results were compared with those obtained from a commercial glucose meter, revealing a strong correlation between the two methods. This finding highlights the potential of the tattoo sensor to detect glucose levels in a noninvasive manner, offering a promising alternative for individuals with diabetes.\n\nFurthermore, control experiments conducted on human subjects emphasized the importance of the reverse iontophoresis operation in ensuring the specificity and accuracy of the sensor. The preliminary investigation suggests that the tattoo-based iontophoresis-sensor platform holds significant promise for efficient diabetes management and could potentially be extended to monitor other analytes present in the interstitial fluid.\n\nThe development of this temporary tattoo glucose sensor represents a significant advancement in the field of wearable health monitoring devices.

And importantly, they absorb ultraviolet light, causing them to glow in the dark.\n\nThe team used tampons to detect pollutants at several surface water outlets connected to local rivers and streams.\n\nThis pollution, they say, is resulting from faulty sewer connections, which is leading to waste water from houses being prematurely discharged into waterways, rather than being sent to treatment plants. \n\n\"The main difficulty with detecting sewage pollution by searching for optical brighteners is finding cotton that does not already contain these chemicals. That's why tampons, being explicitly untreated, provide such a neat solution,\" said lead researcher David Lerner in a press release.\n\"Our new method may be unconventional \u2013 but it's cheap and it works.\"The team is trying to locate housing developments where sewage pipes are incorrectly linked to the surface water network, resulting in pollution.

Despite the unconventional nature of this treatment, FMT has proven to be relatively safe and has shown promising results in combating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.\n\nThe findings of these studies highlight the potential of FMT as a game-changing therapy for patients suffering from recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Further research and long-term trials are needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of this innovative treatment approach. With the growing success rates and safety profile of FMT, it offers hope for improving outcomes and reducing the mortality associated with this debilitating infection.",

But with the right instruments they could allow us to map climate change and take other readings across wide areas, suggest the researchers from the University of Utah and Yunnan University in China.\"It's kind of a new phenomenon,\" says one of the researchers, Keith Koper from the University of Utah. \"We don't really know how it's created.\"Small bursts of seismic activity, called microseisms, are already known to form from ocean waves dragging across the sea floor \u2013 they're part of the background seismic noise observed in coastal locations.\nStudying waves from lakes in this way is a newer idea, and the researchers used data from earlier studies alongside new readings from Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming as well as Dianchi Lake, Fuxian Lake, and Erhai Lake in China.\"The lakes span more than two orders of magnitude in size (areas from 210 km2 to 27,000 km2) and sample a range of climatic and tectonic regimes in Canada, the US, and China,\" the researchers write in their study.What they found was that by averaging seismic activity over longer periods, like six months or so, it's possible to create what the scientists call a \"CT scan of the Earth\".These small seismic waves travel through different geological materials at different speeds, enabling scientists to work out the composition of the ground around a lake \u2013 and without the need for an artificial shock like an explosion or vibrating plate",

The findings, published in a scientific journal, highlight a correlation between microseismic activity in the 1-3 Hz band and wind speed, suggesting that the lake itself may be the source of these seismic events.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from the vaults and found that the root mean square (rms) values in the 1-3 Hz band were coherent between the stations, indicating a common generative mechanism. Additionally, a distinct onshore intermittent flux of Rayleigh-like wave energy was detected near the shore, further supporting the link between microseismic energy and wind activity.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the relationship between incremental microseismic energy above a minimum threshold and wind direction for a fixed wind speed. The researchers observed that this correlation was influenced by the average fetch of the wind over the lake, suggesting that the lake itself serves as the primary source of microseisms in the region.\n\nInterestingly, the study also found that the sensitivity to fetch effects was similar for both onshore and offshore stations, indicating that shoaling \u2013 the process of waves changing in height as they approach the shore \u2013 was likely not a significant factor in the generation of microseismic activity.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers noted that Niagara Falls, which can also experience wind-dependent flow from Lake Erie, had a measurable effect on microseismic activity up to 25 km but did not significantly impact stations located 150 km away. This suggests that the influence of Niagara Falls on microseisms is limited to a relatively close proximity.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between wind speed, lake fetch, and microseismic activity in the region. By identifying Lake Ontario as a source of these seismic events, the research contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between natural phenomena and seismic activity.",

The study, conducted by researchers using an instantaneous scan-sampling technique, revealed a distinct change in the behavior of the chimpanzees in response to the rare celestial event.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Behaviour, documented the behavior of the chimpanzees starting two days prior to the eclipse and continuing through the day following the event. Data was collected daily from 1100 to 1300 hours, with a notable shift in behavior observed at 1214 hours on the day of the eclipse.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the temperature decreased during the eclipse, solitary females and females with infants were observed moving to the top of a climbing structure. Subsequently, additional chimpanzees began to congregate on the structure, orienting their bodies towards the sun and moon as the eclipse progressed.\n\nDuring the period of maximum eclipse at 1223 hours, the chimpanzees continued to face the sun and moon, with one juvenile even gesturing in their direction. The behavior was unique to the eclipse event, as the chimpanzees did not exhibit similar actions before or after the eclipse, nor during normal sunset.\n\nThe researchers noted that the chimpanzees began to descend from the climbing structure as sunlight increased at 1225 hours, indicating a direct response to the changing environmental conditions. The study highlights the influence of rare and uncommon events, such as a solar eclipse, on the behavior of chimpanzees.\n\nThis research provides valuable insights into the behavioral responses of chimpanzees to celestial phenomena and underscores the importance of studying animal behavior in unique environmental contexts. Further studies could explore how other animals react to solar eclipses and deepen our understanding of the impact of rare events on animal behavior.",

(My dog also briefly ran away, but I think that was mostly due to a scary garbage truck.)\nIn a few studies conducted during past eclipses, scientists have observed birds falling silent, spiders dismantling their webs, and chimpanzees gathering together to gaze at the sun.Most of the evidence we have of animals behaving differently during an eclipse is anecdotal, however. Yesterday, zoos, national parks, and science centres across the US encouraged people to report their observations of animals to get more information.On the iNaturalist app created by the California Academy of Sciences, people reported that at totality, fireflies emerged, crickets chirped, and cows mooed. But most of the observations submitted noted that animals didn't do much of anything.Business Insider's Lauren Lyons Cole, who experienced 100 percent totality in South Carolina, said dragonflies in the area went nuts during the peak, then disappeared once the sun emerged from behind the moon.\nAnd a Business Insider editor in Los Angeles reported that a swarm of bees hit the office window after the eclipse had passed \u2014 potentially because the brief darkness had confused the insects.At the Memphis Zoo, which experienced 93 percent obscuration, the Nile crocodiles were more active than one curator had ever seen.Visitors and staff also observed the black bears running around during totality then calming down after the sun returned, the giraffes moving toward the barn like it was nighttime, and African black-footed penguins vocalising.At the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York, which experienced 72 percent coverage, an \"eerie\" quiet fell over the National Recreation Area, Fox 5 reported.The crabs came to the edge of the water, probably thinking it was nighttime and that there wouldn't be any birds around to eat them there.\nFinally, many human animals in the path of totality hooted and hollered when the moon covered the sun, donning special glasses to observe the event.Hopefully the contributions of citizen scientists and the connections researchers were able to make using new technology will yield more reliable results.

The study challenges common misconceptions surrounding premature ejaculation and female sexual dysfunctions, questioning the validity of certain widely accepted concepts.\n\nThe research highlights that human semen is a complex mixture of components originating from various glands in the male reproductive system, including the testes, prostate, seminal vesicles, ampulla, and epididymis. Contrary to popular belief, ejaculation is not a single event but a two-phase process comprising emission and expulsion. During ejaculation, semen collects in the prostatic urethra, triggering preorgasmic distension of the urethral bulb, which signals the impending orgasm.\n\nThe study also addresses the refractory period that follows ejaculation, during which further orgasm or ejaculation is physiologically impossible. It notes that age plays a role in the duration of the refractory period, with older men experiencing longer recovery times. Additionally, the research challenges the notion of premature ejaculation as a male sexual dysfunction, emphasizing that it is not a disease but rather a natural variation in sexual response.\n\nFurthermore, the study questions the existence of vaginal orgasm and other female sexual dysfunctions, suggesting that they may be based on misconceptions. The researchers argue that terms such as G-spot, G-spot amplification, clitoral bulbs, and female ejaculation lack scientific basis, and that the key to female orgasm lies in understanding the female erectile organs.\n\nThe findings of the study advocate for a more comprehensive understanding of human sexual responses, encouraging individuals to explore and understand their own sexual physiology through methods such as masturbation and ejaculatory control techniques. The researchers caution against classifying premature ejaculation as a male sexual dysfunction and raise concerns about the commercialization of sexual medicine, questioning whether premature ejaculation and female sexual dysfunctions are artificially constructed illnesses influenced by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nOverall, the study challenges existing beliefs about ejaculation and orgasm, urging for a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to understanding human sexual responses. It calls for further research to unravel the complexities of sexual physiology and dispel myths surrounding sexual dysfunctions.",

The study, conducted by a team of scientists, sheds light on a novel phenomenon that challenges conventional understanding of droplet behavior in the presence of plasma.\n\nThe researchers achieved the levitation of a conductive droplet by subjecting it to a voltage exceeding 50\u2009V, resulting in a levitation regime reminiscent of the well-known thermal Leidenfrost effect. However, what sets this levitation apart is the emission of light from beneath the droplet. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that this emitted light originates from a cold and dense plasma, with distinct lines from the cathode plate material indicating a local cathodic sputtering effect.\n\nThrough meticulous examination of the conditions necessary for droplet levitation, the researchers determined that the phenomenon is primarily driven by thermal factors. By assuming a stationary heat transfer, they developed a model that accurately predicts the conditions required for stable levitation. Notably, the study highlights that stable levitation is achievable only with thin cathode plates, underscoring the importance of plate thickness in sustaining the levitation effect.\n\nThis research opens up new avenues for understanding the complex interactions between liquid droplets and plasma environments. The ability to levitate droplets above plasma not only expands our knowledge of fundamental physics principles but also holds potential applications in various fields, including materials science and plasma technology.\n\nAs scientists continue to unravel the intricacies of this phenomenon, further research is poised to uncover additional insights into the dynamics of droplet levitation above plasma and its broader implications. The study represents a significant step forward in the exploration of unconventional phenomena at the intersection of physics and plasma science.",
        "b": "French researchers have found a new way to levitate liquid droplets by using a stream of electricity to create a tiny cushion of plasma. In doing so, they may have also found a cheap and easy method to generate freely movable microplasma - and put on a very pretty blue light show to boot.\nWhile levitation may sound like it belongs in the realm of fantasy, scientists have actually become quite skilled at levitating small objects using sound waves and magnets. But researchers from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission have now devised a new method, managing to float liquid droplets using plasma.More than just a cool party trick, the new technique provides some important insight into the production of plasma. It works in a very similar way to something called the\n\nLeidenfrost effect, where liquid droplets sitting on an incredibly hot surface begin to levitate on a hot cushion of vapour. Although you may not have heard of it before, you've probably used it without realising when you sprinkle water on your pan to see if it's hot enough to cook with - if the water droplets skitter across the pan, you're good to go, and that's the Leidenfrost effect in action.But in this experiment, instead of using a hot surface, the French team dropped watered-down hydrochloric acid, which is known for its conductive abilities, onto a metal plate and then began to run an electrical charge through it.Immediately the water in the acid solution began to break down into hydrogen and oxygen gas. At 50 volts, the bottom of the droplet began to spark and levitate slightly off the surface, with an incredibly beautiful blue glow emanating from the tiny gap in between.\nThe researchers initially thought that the drop might be floating on top of the hydrogen gas from the breakup of the water. But after further research, they found that by using electricity to make the vapour cushion instead of heat, they'd actually managed to ionise the gas into plasma.\"This method is probably an easy and original way to make a plasma,\" lead researcher and physicist Cedric Poulain said in a press release.\n\nBut he admits that this was far from the original reason for the experiment, which was more to do with simple scientific curiosity.\"We were interested in a better understanding of the boiling mechanism,\" Poulain told Chuck Bednar over at redOrbit. \"Namely, the formation of bubbles (nucleation), as well as what happens at high heat flux when suddenly all the bubbles coalesce, leading to the well-known film boiling.\"Although they weren't expecting to generate plasma at all, what surprised the team most of all was the blue light emission, seeing as they were only using a relatively low 50 volts. Poulain explains that this was caused by the tiny gap between the droplet and the metal plate, which gave rise\n\nto the very high electric field necessary to generate a long-term and dense plasma with little energy.\nThe next step is for the team to analyse the composition of the plasma cushion, which appears to be a superposition of two types of plasma - something that scientists known very little about.\"It's very exciting,\" said Poulain of the research's unexpected turn. Even though it wasn't what they set out to do, their results could could provide some fascinating insight into the physics of plasma and potentially lead to new, inexpensive ways to form it.

        "a": "Title: Study Explores the Impact of Silence in Turing Tests on Machine Identification\n\nIn a recent study published in a scientific journal, researchers delved into a specific issue surrounding practical Turing tests - the right of a machine to remain silent during interrogation. The study raises the intriguing question of whether a machine could potentially pass the Turing test by simply choosing not to speak.\n\nThe Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In practical Turing tests, judges interact with both humans and machines without knowing which is which, and attempt to correctly identify the machine based on their responses.\n\nThe study included a series of transcripts from practical Turing tests where silence was observed on the part of a hidden entity, which could either be a human or a machine. Surprisingly, in each of these instances, the judges were unable to definitively identify the hidden entity as a machine, highlighting the potential impact of silence on the identification process.\n\nThe researchers found that the presence of silence during the Turing test created ambiguity for the judges, making it challenging for them to make the correct identification. This raises important questions about the role of silence in human-machine interactions and its implications for the validity of the Turing test as a measure of machine intelligence.\n\nThe study sheds light on the complexities of evaluating machine intelligence and the need to consider not only the responses given by machines but also their choice to remain silent. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, understanding the nuances of human-machine interactions will be crucial in developing more robust tests for assessing machine intelligence.\n\nFurther research in this area could provide valuable insights into how silence influences the outcomes of Turing tests and inform the development of more sophisticated methods for evaluating machine intelligence. The study underscores the importance of exploring unconventional aspects of machine behavior to enhance our understanding of artificial intelligence and its capabilities.",
        "b": "While it has its fair share of critics, the Turing test has become one of the most well-known ways of measuring artificial intelligence. The test, originally developed in 1950, states that if a human being can't tell the difference between an AI and a real human over a chat program, the AI has passed.\nBut now scientists have discovered a loophole of sorts in the Turing test, and it involves one of the oldest tricks in the book: simply staying silent.It turns out that silence on the part of the AI can help skew the perception of the person on the other end of the conversation, who is left wondering whether he or she is dealing with a shy (or offended) human being or a broken AI-powered bot.Scientists from Coventry University in the UK looked at six transcripts from earlier Turing tests and found that when the machines stopped speaking, it put doubt in the minds of the judges. Often the silence wasn't any intentional coyness on the part of the AI, and was simply due to technical problems.\"The technical issues entailed the failure of the computer programs to relay messages or responses to the judge's questions,\" one of the researchers, Huma Shah, told Dyllan Furness at\n\nDigital Trends. \"The judges were unaware of the situation and hence in some cases they classified their hidden interlocutor as 'unsure'.\"\nIf the judge is unsure, the AI has succeeded.As Shah and fellow researcher Kevin Warwick note in their study, there's still plenty of controversy over the 'rules' of the Turing test, and plenty of ambiguity about what exactly its creator Alan Turing intended the challenge to actually measure.The interpretation used in this case is the basic \"imitation game\" described by Turing: the AI has to be able to pretend to be human to a reasonably convincing level.Leaving aside the debate over the conditions of the Turing test itself, the study considers the various repercussions of a bot effectively pleading\n\nthe Fifth Amendment (staying quiet).If a machine can fool humans by being tight-lipped, argue the researchers, then passing the test doesn't prove the machine can think \u2013 just that it can clam up (and by that reckoning, a stone could pass just as easily). If the human judge is unsure, that means the AI has won: and how can any certain judgement be made if the machine says nothing?\nThe team suggests that clever bots could keep quiet to avoid giving themselves away with a stupid answer, and that future Turing tests could be tweaked so silence automatically disqualifies a contestant, whether they're artificial or human.According to Shah, Turing designed his test to encourage the development of \"elaborate machines to respond in a satisfactory and sustained manner\", not just bots that are trying to fool their judges by staying schtum. In other words, it's not really playing fair or in the intended nature of the test, even if it's effective.Perhaps we need a new Turing test for the 21st century \u2013 after all, computing has come a long way since 1950. Or maybe the test is no longer as relevant as it once was, given the staggering advances AI has made in the past several decades.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently predicted\n\nthat\n\nthe future of AI is \"not going to be about human vs. machine\", but rather about how intelligent systems can help augment and enhance what we already do best. It's something these researchers tend to agree with.\"The role of AI is to augment human performance with intelligent agents,\" Shah told Digital Trends. \"For example, a human educator using an AI to score student assignments and exam questions leaving the teacher time to innovate learning, inspiring students, encouraging more into STEM, including females, for a better life or world of cooperation.\"The findings have been published in the Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence",

The study sheds light on how these conservation projects, often tied to nature-based tourism, are being implemented as a means to alleviate rural poverty.\n\nThe researchers conducted socio-economic surveys and in-depth interviews within the Uibasen Conservancy to understand how local communities are engaging with neoliberal conservation initiatives. They discovered that many individuals are drawn to these projects due to their aspirations for economic and social advancement. By participating in nature-based tourism activities, community members aim to blend the economic opportunities presented by conservation efforts with their traditional livelihood strategies.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that certain aspects of neoliberal conservation are viewed as a beacon of hope by non-elites who are striving for economic self-sufficiency and social mobility. Despite the disruptive nature of these projects, marginalized individuals are embracing neoliberal logics in an effort to improve their socio-economic status.\n\nHowever, the research also uncovered underlying power struggles within the community, leading to discontent and local conflicts that overshadow the negative impacts of the global tourism industry.

The ministry is seeking criminal charges.Although one of the worst cases, this is only the latest in a series of recent conflicts between humans and lions in the area. In June 2016, a lioness was shot dead after a bull was killed by a pride of lions near the settlement of Otjindakui.Earlier that month, the first Musketeer to be killed died from a bullet wound near a temporary cattle-post in the region.Conflict is inevitableThese incidents reflect recent expansion in lion distribution in Namibia's Kunene region. A result is economic damage, borne disproportionately by unlucky farmers.Compensation, when received, may not cover the cost of a lost cow or bull. As such, increasing lion numbers cause tour guides to celebrate while locals are dismayed.\nClashes between humans and lions in a region celebrated by tourists and conservationists have encouraged significant investment in addressing human-wildlife conflict.Community game guards were established in the early 1980s, beginning a widely praised model of \"community-based natural resources management\"\n\nfinanced by donors including the WWF and the US and UK international aid departments.The kraal and tent of a lone Herero herder whose donkey was killed by lions. Sian Sullivan, Author providedSince 1996 indigenous Namibians have been able to legally derive incomes from wildlife in recognised territories managed as \"conservancies\".The vision is that this income will increase the value of indigenous fauna and flora as economically-productive resources, countering the costs to other livelihood activities of sharing land with wildlife whilst offering routes towards rural development.\nThe success of these conservancies, combined until recently with favourable wetter climatic conditions since the mid-1990s, has led to increasing lion populations.Efforts to smooth over resulting tensions with local people include a compensation scheme for herders paid for by safari operators; a community 'lion task force' and 'lion rangers'\n\nwho monitor lion movements and advise herders when to move away; lion proof kraals (cattle pens); and bright lights, ultra-sound, and fireworks to discourage lions from approaching settlements.These initiatives do much to mitigate the conflict. But current drought is causing herders to overlap with lion, the former seeking dispersed grazing, the latter dispersed prey animals.Expanding tourism has encouraged lions to become more confident around humans. And prey animals like zebra and antelope already affected by drought may be reduced further by shoot-to-sell policies, whereby conservancies sell rights to outside contractors to shoot animals to supply butcheries elsewhere.Different strokes for different folks?Human-lion conflicts can also act as a flash-point for other frustrations. Livestock herders in communal areas are experiencing punitive measures for trying to protect their animals in a context of historical land appropriation that squeezed indigenous Namibians into less productive landscapes.Namibia's commercial (and still largely white-owned) farming areas sometimes experience lion attacks but benefited historically from significant clearance of major predators. One celebrated former warden of Etosha National Park killed 75 lions to help farmers protect their cattle, before being employed in conservation in 1958.Today, wealthy visitors from afar hunt 'game' animals as trophies, including the occasional lion. Many conservancies are financed significantly by trophy-hunting and tourism, and some local people succeed as hunting and tourism professionals.But these benefits aren't evenly distributed, and can cause distrust over new inequalities linked with conservancy management and private sector investments.All these factors contribute to the intractable nature of the human-lion conflict. This problem is not about to disappear. At the same time, local people with different histories have different ideas about how to live with lions.Learning more about positive stories of how people lived with predators in the past may yet help people and lions to live alongside each other into the future.Sian Sullivan, Professor of Environment and Culture, Bath Spa UniversityThis article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

        "a": "Title: Study Reveals Significant Increase in Brain Ketone Levels During Fasting\n\nA recent study published in a scientific journal has shed light on the levels of ketones in the brain during fasting-induced ketosis. Ketones are known to be an important source of fuel for the brain, with brain ketone content traditionally believed to be low. However, the study conducted by researchers has challenged this notion by measuring brain beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels in healthy adults undergoing fasting.\n\nThe study utilized high field (4-T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure brain BHB and lactate levels in the occipital lobe of healthy adults. Participants were studied in a nonfasted state and after 2- and 3-day fasting-induced ketosis. The results showed a significant increase in brain BHB levels, with the mean concentration rising from 0.05 \u00b1 0.05 mmol/L in the nonfasted state to 0.98 \u00b1 0.16 mmol/L after the third day of fasting.\n\nAdditionally, brain lactate levels also increased during fasting, from 0.69 \u00b1 0.17 mmol/L in the nonfasted state to 1.47 \u00b1 0.22 mmol/L after the third day. The study found a strong correlation between plasma and brain BHB levels, indicating that changes in plasma BHB levels are reflected in the brain.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the increase in brain BHB levels during fasting-induced ketosis may lead to the displacement of lactate oxidation without affecting glucose phosphorylation and glycolysis. This finding provides valuable insights into the metabolic processes that occur in the brain during periods of fasting and ketosis.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the significant rise in brain ketone levels during fasting and underscores the importance of understanding the role of ketones in brain metabolism. Further research in this area could have implications for conditions where brain metabolism is altered, such as epilepsy or neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "b": "Some people on very low-carb diets say they feel euphoric, have clear minds and lose their appetite.Going low-carb might even mimic the effects of GHB \u2013 the recreational drug better known as fantasy, liquid ecstasy or grievous bodily harm \u2013 on the brain.\nTo understand why we need to look at how the body processes a very low-carb diet, one that typically limits carbohydrates to no more than 50 grams a day. That's one cup of rice, two slices of bread or roughly 10 percent of your total daily energy needs.I've gone from low carb crash to low carb euphoria! Wtf body y didn't u tell me u were hiding this much energy #diet #crazy #oncrack\u2014 T. L. Shreffler (@catseyeauthor) April 15, 2014Your body thinks it's starvingA very low-carb diet flips your metabolic switch from burning more carbs than fat, to more fat than carbs. This usually takes a few days in a process known as ketosis.During this time, your body thinks it's starving. Once it uses up most of your glucose (carb) reserves, the body stimulates the breakdown of stored fat into fatty acids and releases them into the blood.\nWhen fatty acids reach the liver they're converted into acetoacetate, an excellent metabolic fuel that belongs to a family of chemicals called ketones. That's why very low-carb diets are sometimes called \"ketogenic\" diets.Acetoacetate decomposes to carbon dioxide and acetone, the smelly solvent best known for its ability to remove nail polish. This is why very low-carb dieters and people who are fasting often have sweet smelling breath.A healthy liver minimises the acetone lost via the lungs by converting most of the acetoacetate it produces to a more stable substance, called beta-hydroxybutyrate or BHB. And this is where those euphoric feelings could come from. width=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">BHB is almost identical to GHB, the naturally occurring neurotransmitter, called gamma-hydroxybutyrate, that in synthetic form is used as a recreational drug.\nBHB and GHB have exactly the same chemical formula. Both consist of just 15 atoms, with the only difference being the position of one hydrogen and oxygen atom.It's not too surprising, therefore, the two molecules share the same carrier across the blood-brain-barrier, the impermeable tissue that protects the brain.During ketosis, BHB can reach high levels in the brain, where it can bind to the same anxiety-reducing receptors as GHB. They bind with sufficient affinity that they may have similar effects.There are no reports of BHB supplements or low-carb diets causing any of GHB's adverse effects, like loss of consciousness, seizures and death.So, apart from the similar-sounding name, what evidence is there that BHB produced by the liver by people on a very low-carb diet has euphoric, GHB-like effects in the brain?\nFasting for the original 'natural high'The first case of euphoria directly attributed to ketosis was reported by Walter Bloom, who pioneered therapeutic fasts for obesity in the 1950s. After several days without food, his patients lost their appetite, felt remarkably well, and experienced a mild intoxication: \"not dissimilar to the effects of ethanol\".Bloom speculated that acetoacetate had caused the inexplicable jubilation.Other people have observed similar effects, including three Scottish doctors whose patients fasted for up to 249 days in the 1960s. After several days without food, their appetites subsided and all patients felt an increased sense of well-being which: \"in some amounted to frank euphoria\".Unfortunately, no studies of the euphoria reported by low-carb dieters have been conducted, as far as we know.\nSo, researchers don't know the exact cause of these feelings. Acetoacetate, acetone and BHB, or any of their metabolites, may all be involved, as well as the effects of low blood sugar, which can cause euphoria and giddiness.A good place to start might be to image brain activity in people on a very low-carb diet and compare activity with people on a normal, non-calorie restricted diet. The aim would be to see if brain imaging of people on a very low-carb diet has similar effects on brain activity seen when people take GHB.And if you're thinking of going on a very low-carb diet to get that high, beware.

The study, which included one field study and three lab studies, revealed intriguing findings about how the act of taking photos can influence memory recall.\n\nThe researchers found that participants who were able to freely take photographs during an experience demonstrated better recognition of visual aspects but poorer recognition of auditory aspects compared to those who could not take any photographs. Surprisingly, even without revisiting any photos, the participants who had the opportunity to take photos during the experience showed enhanced visual memory and diminished auditory memory.\n\nMoreover, the study indicated that simply taking mental photos had similar effects on memory, suggesting that the act of capturing images, whether physically or mentally, can induce a shift in attention towards visual aspects and away from auditory aspects of an experience.\n\nThe results also revealed that participants with a camera had better recognition of aspects of the scene they photographed compared to aspects they did not photograph. Additionally, participants who used a camera during their experience showed improved recognition of even non-photographed aspects compared to those without a camera.\n\nMeta-analyses conducted on all reported studies supported these findings, further solidifying the notion that photo-taking during experiences can influence memory recall by enhancing visual memory while potentially impairing auditory memory.\n\nThese findings shed light on the complex relationship between photo-taking and memory, suggesting that the act of capturing moments through photos can have a significant impact on how we remember and recall our experiences.

What's more, in both experiments those who could snap photos were also more likely to remember objects they hadn't specifically taken pictures of as well as ones they had.\"These findings suggest that having a camera changes how people approach an experience in a fundamental way,\" says the team.\"Even when people don't take a photo of a particular object, like a sculpture, but have a camera with them and the intention to take photos, they remember that sculpture better than people who did not have a camera with them.\"What's also interesting is that the study participants weren't allowed to review their photos before taking memory tests, which mimics what we tend to do in real life \u2013 taking a pile of photos of everything we see before never looking at them again.\nIt's almost as if the potential to take photos makes us more aware of our surroundings.Remember that human beings have only been able to capture moments in time in the form of photographs for less than 200 years, and the researchers suggest we've still got a lot to learn about the effects of photography on human behaviour.With the rise of digital photography and then smartphones, taking pictures and sharing them with millions of other people is now instant and effortless \u2013 and we still don't know exactly how that's affecting our take on life.\"Given the increasing centrality of photography in people's lives, addressing these open questions will be both theoretically interesting and relevant to people's lives,\" conclude the researchers in their published paper.The research has been published in Psychological Science",

The new device is about 20,000 times smaller than a human hair.According to the University of Montreal team, the new device was inspired by a 60-year-old discovery that DNA molecules unfold when heated to a certain temperature. Could this be the basis of new tiny thermometer technology?\"In recent years, biochemists also discovered that biomolecules such as proteins or RNA (a molecule similar to DNA) are employed as nanothermometers in living organisms and report temperature variation by folding or unfolding,\" said one of the team,\n\nAlexis Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle.\n\"Inspired by those natural nanothermometers, which are typically 20,000 times smaller than a human hair, we have created various DNA structures that can fold and unfold at specifically defined temperatures.\"Basically, since DNA consists of four nucleotides (A, T, C, and G), the team was able to simply design a mechanism that would force the molecule to fold or unfold at a given temperature, which is a very rudimentary form of a thermometer - it's more of a temperature signalling device.\"By adding optical reporters to these DNA structures, we can\n\ntherefore create 5 nm-wide thermometers that produce an easily detectable signal as a function of temperature,\" said one of the researchers,\n\nArnaud Desrosiers.The new thermometer will hopefully allow researchers to answer a slew of questions that have gone unanswered for years, such as whether or not the human body runs hotter than 37 degrees Celsius on the nanoscale, or if naturally occurring nanomachines overheat when functioning at high rate.The team is now working on improving their tiny DNA thermometer to incorporate it into new electronic devices.Their findings have been published in the journal Nano Letters",

        "a": "Until very recently, one of the biggest myths in science was that all dinosaurs have been extinct for the past 65 million years. But thanks to new fossil discoveries that filled in our knowledge about avian dinosaurs, we now know that only some dinosaurs went extinct following an asteroid collision with Earth - others survived and gave rise to the birds we live with today.\nTo figure out how this evolution occurred, researchers in Chile have manipulated the genes of regular chickens so they develop tubular, dinosaur-like fibulas on their lower legs - one of the two long, spine-like bones you'll find in a drumstick.In avian dinosaurs such as the Archaeopteryx, the fibula was a tube-shaped bone that reached all the way down to the ankle. Another bone, the tibia, grew to a similar length alongside it.As evolution progressed through to a group of avian dinosaurs known as the\n\nPygostylians,\n\nthe fibula became shorter than the tibia, and sharper and more splinter-like towards the end, and it no longer reached the ankle.While modern bird embryos still show signs of developing long, dinosaur-like fibulae, as they grow, these bones become shorter, thinner, and also take on the splinter-like ends of the Pygostylian bones, and never make it far enough down to the leg to connect with the ankle.\nResearchers led by Jo\u00e2o Botelho from the University of Chile decided to investigate how this transition from a long, tubular fibula in dinosaurs to a short, splinter-like fibula in birds actually came to be.They achieved this by inhibiting the expression of a gene called IHH or Indian Hedgehog (seriously), which saw their chickens continue to grow the long, dinosaur-like fibulae that originated in their embryonic form.\n\nIn doing so, the team discovered something bizarre. Regular bone development sees cell division and therefore growth halt in the shaft long before the ends stop growing, but in modern chickens, the growth of the fibula halts first at the ends. This means the fibulae of modern chickens are actively blocked from reaching the lengths of their ancient relatives' bones.Jo\u00e2o Botelho et. al.Publishing their observations in the journal Evolution, the researchers suggest that the early maturation of the lower end of the fibula in modern chickens is prompted by a bone in the ankle, called the calcaneum.\n\"Unlike other animals, the calcaneum in bird embryos presses against the lower end of the fibula,\" the team explains in a press release. \"They are so close, they have even been mistaken for a single element by some researchers.\"The team suggests that in regular chickens, interactions between the calcaneum and the end of the fibula result in signals that are similar to the ones that prompt the bone shaft to stop growing, preventing the fibula from reaching anywhere near the ankle bone.\n\nBut when the Indian Hedgehog gene was turned off, the calcaneum strongly expresses the gene Parathyroid-related protein (PthrP), which allows for growth at the ends of bones. This caused their chickens to grow long fibulae that connected with the ankle, just like they would in the\n\nArchaeopteryx.\n\n\"Experimental downregulation of IHH signalling at a postmorphogenetic stage led to a tibia and fibula of equal length,\" the team writes in the report. \"The fibula is longer than in controls and fused to the fibulare, whereas the tibia is shorter and bent.",
        "b": "Title: Study Reveals Molecular Mechanisms Behind Bird Fibula Reduction During Evolution\n\nA recent study published in a scientific journal has shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduction of the fibula in birds during embryonic development. The research, conducted on chicken embryos, found that the distal end of the fibula expresses Indian hedgehog (IHH) while showing minimal expression of Parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP), which is crucial for the development of a growth plate.\n\nThe study revealed that in the early stages of embryonic development, both the tibia and fibula start out with similar lengths. However, as development progresses, the fibula undergoes terminal cartilage differentiation, leading to its distal reduction compared to the tibia. This reduction may be influenced by the close contact of the fibula with the fibulare, a nearby skeletal element that strongly expresses PTHrP.\n\nExperimental downregulation of IHH signaling at a later stage of development resulted in significant changes in the lengths and structures of the tibia and fibula. The fibula became longer than in the control group and fused with the fibulare, while the tibia became shorter and bent. This suggests that the presence of a distal fibular epiphysis may limit the growth of the tibia.\n\nThe findings of the study also provide insights into the evolution of bird skeletal structures. Many Mesozoic birds exhibit a fibula that has lost its distal epiphysis but remains almost as long as the tibia. This suggests that the loss of the fibulare preceded the reduction of the fibula, allowing for the subsequent evolution of significant differences in length between the fibula and tibia.\n\nOverall, this research contributes to our understanding of the molecular processes involved in the development and evolution of avian skeletal structures. By uncovering the mechanisms behind fibula reduction in birds, scientists can gain valuable insights into the evolutionary changes that have shaped avian anatomy over millions of years.",

This remarkable speed enhancement is attributed to the concept of entanglement, where entangled qubits enable the manipulation of multiple states simultaneously, leading to unprecedented computational power.\n\nThe race to develop a 49-qubit quantum computer signifies a major leap forward in the field of quantum computing, with potential implications for a wide range of industries and scientific disciplines.

Their observations revealed a double-peaked light curve, unlike any previously documented in the realm of core-collapse supernovae.\n\nOne of the most striking features of DES14X3taz is its initial peak, characterized by a rapid cooling from 22,000 to 8,000 Kelvin over a span of 15 rest-frame days. This initial peak, brighter and faster than any known core-collapse supernova, reached 30% of the bolometric luminosity of the main peak. Surprisingly, existing physical models powered by 56Ni were unable to account for this unique behavior.\n\nTo explain the enigmatic light curve of DES14X3taz, the researchers proposed a novel model involving shock-cooling followed by the influence of a magnetar driving the second phase of the supernova's luminosity. This comprehensive model successfully elucidated the entire evolution of the light curve, offering a plausible explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\nFurthermore, the study compared DES14X3taz to other double-peaked SLSN-I events documented in the literature, noting variations in rise times and characteristics of the initial peaks. Despite these differences, the researchers suggest the tantalizing possibility of a unified physical interpretation that could explain the diverse behaviors observed in these extraordinary cosmic events.\n\nThe discovery of DES14X3taz and the elucidation of its complex light curve provide valuable insights into the nature of superluminous supernovae and the underlying mechanisms governing their luminous displays. By unraveling the mysteries of these cosmic phenomena, scientists are one step closer to understanding the extreme conditions and processes that drive the explosive deaths of massive stars in the universe.",
        "b": "An international team of astronomers working with the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain say they have witnessed the same superluminous supernova explode twice.The supernova went from bright to dim two times \u2013 instead of just once, which was what the researchers expected.\nThe team says this double-whammy explosion is likely the result of a magnetar \u2013 a rapidly rotating neutron star that forms after a gigantic stars collapses.Their findings shed new light on these superluminous supernovae, or SLSNs, pushing astronomers closer to a complete model of how they operate.\"From our data, we have tried to determine if this is a characteristic unique to this object, or whether it is a common feature of all superluminous supernovae, but has not been observed before, which is perfectly possible given their unpredictable nature,\" team leader Mathew Smith, from the University of Southampton in the UK, said in a statement.SLSN are much bigger than the other types of supernovae that researchers typically observe, which are categorised by how much light they give off.\nFor example, one of the most commonly seen types is called Ia, which form within binary systems and usually appear very bright for a few weeks before burning out completely. SLSN, on the other hand, are even brighter and can stay bright for up to six months.This isn't the first time researchers have been shocked by SLSNs, though.\n\nBack in January, a team of astronomers working with the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile witnessed one of the biggest SLSNs ever recorded, which they said was over 200 times more powerful than any on record.Despite the amazing show they put on in the night sky, researchers have only witnessed about 12 of them, meaning there isn't a lot of data about how they work.The new study is the first to observe a SLSN from the moment it exploded to the moment it died out, allowing researchers to witness every detail.\n\"Superluminous supernovae are up to a hundred times more energetic than type 1a supernovae because they can remain bright for up to six months before fading, rather than just a few weeks,\" Smith said.\"What we have managed to observe, which is completely new, is that before the major explosion, there is a shorter, less luminous outburst, which we can pick out because it is followed by a dip in the light curve, and which lasts just a few days.\"The celestial object the team studied is known to astronomers as DES14X3taz, which lies 6,400 light-years away and was originally discovered by astronomers working with the Dark Energy Survey back in December 2014.After that team pegged the object as a possible SLSN, the current team used the GTC to monitor its activity on 26 January 2015 and again on 6 February 2015, witnessing a strange dip in brightness that makes it appear that the supernova happened twice, an event that researchers previously thought couldn't occur.\n\"From our data, we have tried to determine if this is a characteristic unique to this object, or whether it is a common feature of all superluminous supernovae, but has not been observed before, which is perfectly possible given their unpredictable nature,\" Smith said.To study the weird phenomenon, the team analyses the data they collected with computer models to see if any lined up with what they saw. In the end, they concluded that the double rise in brightness was likely caused by the formation of a magnetar, an awesomely named neutron star that rotates very quickly, becoming bright as it grows in size. As Smith explains:\n\"We think that a very massive star, some 200 times the mass of the Sun, collapses to form a magnetar. In the process, the first explosion occurs, which expels into space a quantity of matter equivalent to the mass of our sun, and this gives rise to the first peak of the graph.\nThe second peak occurs when the star collapses to form the magnetar, which is a very dense object rotating rapidly on its axis, and which heats up the matter expelled from the first explosion. This heating is what generates the second peak in the luminosity.\"\nThe team's findings shed new light on how SLSNs form and die out, providing possible data for future studies that will \u2013 hopefully \u2013 lead to a complete model of the strange supernovae.The new findings were recently published in the journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters",

        "a": "Title: Earliest Evidence of Wild Potato Use in North America Uncovered in Southern Utah\n\nA groundbreaking discovery has shed light on the early use of wild potatoes in North America, challenging previous assumptions about the ancient diets of indigenous populations. A recent study published in a scientific journal has revealed the earliest documented evidence of potato use in North America dating back to 10,900-10,100 years before present (cal B.P.) in southern Utah.\n\nThe research, conducted at North Creek Shelter in southern Utah, involved the analysis of starch granules extracted from ground stone tools. These starch granules were identified as belonging to Solanum jamesii Torr., also known as the Four Corners potato, a tuber-bearing species native to the American Southwest. The identification was based on specific diagnostic characteristics, including eccentric hilum, longitudinal fissure, lack of fissure branching, fissure ratio, and maximum granule size.\n\nThe study found that the oldest starch granules of S. jamesii were present in substratum 4k, dating back to 10,900-10,100 cal B.P. Additionally, younger deposits dating to approximately 6,900 cal B.P. also contained tools with S. jamesii granules, indicating at least 4,000 years of intermittent use. Ethnographic and historical accounts from the region further extend the period of wild potato use to more than 10,000 years.\n\nThis discovery challenges previous assumptions that wild potatoes were not a significant part of ancient diets in North America. The findings suggest that wild potato use was established much earlier than previously thought and raises questions about the potential transport, cultivation, and eventual domestication of S. jamesii populations over the millennia.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of reevaluating the role of wild potatoes in ancient diets and the need to consider their significance in archaeological studies. The research opens up new avenues for exploring the domestication and diversification of wild potato species in North America, providing valuable insights into the early culinary practices of indigenous populations in the region.",
        "b": "One day last March I talked with Juliana and Elisa, a mother and daughter who farmed just outside the city of Hu\u00e1nuco, Peru.Although they had only one acre of land in this mountainous landscape, they grew dozens of local varieties of potatoes and corn, along with other crops. And they knew each of their varieties by a common name \u2013 mostly in their Quechua language.\nPotatoes are native to the Andes, and over 4,000 varieties are grown there now. They come in numerous shapes, sizes and colors \u2013 red, yellow, purple, striped and spotted. A colorful mound of them resembles the bold, burnished colors of locally woven shawls.This wide array of types is an example of agrobiodiversity \u2013 a genetic legacy created by natural selection interacting with cultural practices over thousands of years.Today, however, agrobiodiversity is declining in many countries.In Mexico farmers are cultivating only 20 percent of the corn types that were grown there in 1930. Chinese farmers are producing only 10 percent of 10,000 varieties of wheat that were recorded there in 1949.More than 95 percent of known apple varieties that existed in the United States in 1900 are no longer cultivated.\nAccording to Bioversity International, an international research and policy organisation, just three crops \u2013 rice, wheat and maize \u2013 provide more than half of plant-derived calories consumed worldwide.This is a problem because our diets are heavy in calories, sugar and saturated fat and low in fruits and vegetables.\n\nBut there also are bright spots, such as Andean potatoes.\n\nIn a recent article, Stef de Haan of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and I call for a major effort to strengthen agrobiodiversity for the future.Consuming many different species and varieties provides a diet that offers many unique tastes and a wide selection of nutrients that humans need to thrive.It also can help ensure more stable food systems and the needed variety of desirable genetic traits, such as hardiness.\nWealthy nations have less-diverse dietsGenerally, agrobiodiversity is significantly lower in wealthy nations, where the industrial food system pushes toward genetic uniformity.For example, federal agriculture policy in the United States tends to favour raising large crops of corn and soybeans, which are big business. Crop subsidies, federal renewable fuel targets and many other factors reinforce this focus on a few commodity crops.In turn, this system drives production and consumption of inexpensive, low-quality food based on a simplified diet.The lack of diversity of fruit and vegetables in the American diet has contributed to a national public health crisis that is concentrated among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.Low agrobiodiversity also makes US agriculture more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change.Agrobiodiversity is a set of genetic resources in food and agriculture. (FAO)To connect these conditions to agrobiodiversity, consider potatoes. Although the United States has 10 times more people than Peru, only about 150 varieties of potato are sold here.\nSix varieties account for three-quarters of our national potato harvest. They dominate because they produce high yields under optimal conditions and are easy to store, transport and process \u2013 especially into french fries and potato chips.Federal policies have helped these varieties become established by reducing the cost of irrigation.Ironically, rich agrobiodiversity in many low- and medium-income nations supports more standardised and genetically uniform breeding industries in wealthy nations.US and European scientists and seed companies have used the diversity of Andean potatoes and their relatives to create commercial varieties that are the roots of modern industrial agriculture.How change can promote agrobiodiversityTo protect and increase agrobiodiversity, we have to know how to value it in a rapidly changing world.\nIn the GeoSynthESES Lab that I lead at Penn State, we are developing an ambitious new framework to analyse whether and how agrobiodiversity can continue to be produced and consumed in the future.Thanks to our fieldwork in Peru and other countries, we're finding that certain global dynamics, such as urbanisation and migration, can be compatible with agrobiodiversity production and consumption.For example, Elisa and Juliana live within a few miles of the Hu\u00e1nuco urban area, and they both work jobs in the city. Their \"traditional\" farming and eating patterns blend with their part-time farming.Such changes can even support the innovative use of local food varieties, but only under the right conditions.Farmers must have sufficient land and water. They have to continue preferring these food flavours and tastes. Vibrant local markets for these foods make producing them economically viable.\nTogether with collaborators working in Hu\u00e1nuco, our lab is assessing ways in which global trends could undercut agrobiodiversity in Peru.One concern is local adoption of \"improved varieties\" of both potatoes and corn that are being created by national and international breeding programs and private seed companies.Under favourable conditions, these types provide high yields and potentially good sales income. But the seeds can be expensive by local standards, and growing them requires more inputs, such as fungicides and irrigation.Farmers who use them are less resilient if it's a bad growing year or if cash is low. For these reasons more than one-half of the potato and maize seed being grown by the Hu\u00e1nuco farmers still comes from local sources such as nearby markets, neighbours and family members.So far, farmers in Hu\u00e1nuco and elsewhere in Peru prefer to growth both their traditional crops and new ones if possible. But discussions of new initiatives to extend the reach of such \"improved varieties\" reflect how these challenges will continue to evolve.Shifting dietsWe also are analysing local impacts of the global spread of inexpensive, low-quality industrial foods.Juliana, Elisa and their Hu\u00e1nuco neighbours increasingly depend on staples such as rice and sugar and on heavy use of cooking oil. Many of them still grow high-agrobiodiversity crops, but on a smaller scale, and these crops play a shrinking role in their diets.It is important to counter this trend by revaluing these nutritious foods, both for human health and for the environmental benefits that agrobiodiversity brings.On the positive side, middle-class Peruvians are embracing agrobiodiverse foods sold through markets and food fairs, such as the huge annual Mistura food festival in Lima.Internationally renowned elite restaurants and celebrity chefs are potentially important, nontraditional allies. It is crucial to find ways in which Elisa, Juliana and other producers of agrobiodiverse foods can earn rewards from these new markets.There also is growing interest in agrobiodiversity in the United States. Potato farmers here in central Pennsylvania and across the Northeast are reviving more than 100 local varieties that until recently had been considered lost.In the Southwest, research groups recently uncovered evidence of the ancient 'Four Corners Potato', the first known wild potato in North America, which was used some 10,000 years ago. DNA from this species could provide genes to make modern potato strains more resistant to drought and disease.Global shifts of urbanisation, migration, markets and climate can potentially be compatible with agrobiodiversity, but other powerful forces are undermining it.The imperatives of producing food at lower cost and higher yield clash with efforts to raise high-quality food and protect the environment. The future of agrobiodiversity hangs in the balance.Karl Zimmerer, Professor of Geography, Pennsylvania State University.This article was originally published by The Conversation.

The collagen sponge, comprising at least two \u03b1-peptides, exhibited a denaturation temperature of 44.99 \u00b0C. Importantly, the sponge did not elicit adverse effects on immune responses in animal models, including the number of spleen-derived lymphocytes, the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio, and the levels of IgG or IgM.\n\nThe collagen nanofibers displayed favorable properties, with a contact angle of 21.2\u00b0, a tensile strength of 6.72 \u00b1 0.44 MPa, and a weight loss temperature of 300 \u00b0C. These nanofibers demonstrated the ability to enhance the viability of human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Furthermore, they promoted epidermal differentiation by upregulating the gene expression of key proteins involved in skin barrier function, such as involucrin, filaggrin, and type I transglutaminase in HaCaTs.\n\nNotably, the collagen nanofibers also facilitated the migration of HaCaTs by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Additionally, these nanofibers upregulated the protein level of collagen type I (Col-I) in HDFs, both directly and through TGF-\u03b21 secreted from HaCaTs, thereby promoting the formation of collagen fibers.\n\nIn vivo experiments demonstrated that the collagen nanofibers accelerated skin regeneration effectively, highlighting their potential for wound healing applications. The observed biological effects were attributed to the biomimetic extracellular matrix structure, hydrophilicity, and diverse amino acid composition of the collagen nanofibers.\n\nThese findings pave the way for the development of innovative wound dressings that harness the regenerative properties of tilapia skin collagen nanofibers. The ability of these nanofibers to promote skin regeneration and enhance cellular functions holds promise for advancing the field of wound care and tissue engineering. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to explore the full potential of these novel biomaterials in promoting accelerated wound healing and improving patient outcomes.",
        "b": "Researchers have known about the healing properties of collagen, which is the main structural protein found in the connective tissues of animals, for many years. Mammal collagen, especially from pigs and cows, has been extensively used for skin wound healing in hospitals all over the world. But the problem with mammal collagen is that it carries the risk of disease transmission, such as foot-and-mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, plus many people can't receive it due to their religious beliefs.\nBut fish collagen? It's cheaper, safer, and there's a whole lot of it to go around.\n\nBack in 2008, research showed that nanofibres made from collagen-rich, discarded fish scales had enough tensile strength to be used as a wound-dressing material, and when applied topically, encouraged the growth of skin cells. Containing around 70 percent collagen, fish skin is even better than fish scales, and is closer in form and structure to human skin, so a team of scientists from the Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine in the US decided to test out its healing powers.Using a series of processing and purification technologies, the team managed to extract pieces of high-quality collagen sponge from discarded tilapia skin. They first tested to see if it would provoke an immune response, which would be bad, because it means the body is rejecting it.\n\nTo find out, they mixed mouse spleen lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - and mixed them with the tilapia collagen sponge. The contact did not cause the lymphocytes to proliferate, which means there was no immune response. \"Furthermore, tilapia collagen encouraged the growth of fibroblasts and increased the expression of genes involved in wound healing,\" Alex B. Berezow reports at Real Clear Science. \"Thus, these experiments indicated that tilapia collagen is well-suited for regenerative medicine.\"\nNext, the researchers tested the strength of a wound dressing made from tilapia collagen and found that it was tough, and stable at temperatures up to around 300 degrees Celsius.The final test was its actual wound-healing ability. Rats with 1.8-centimetre long wounds on their backs were treated with either the new fish collagen wound dressings, an algae-based wound dressing called Kaltostat, or nothing at all. You can see the results below:Credit: Tian Zhou et. al.\"Compared to the control groups, the wound-healing rate was significantly improved, crust started to disappear at day seven, and most of the wound area was covered with a continuous epidermis at day 14 in the collagen nanofibres group, while the skin wounds in the other two groups were not fully healed,\" the team reports in Applied Materials & Interfaces. \"The histopathological results confirmed that the collagen nanofibres caused the lowest degree of inflammatory response and induced the best growth status of new epidermis throughout the process of wound healing.\"\nThe next step will be human trials, and turning it into a commercially viable product. But it won't be easy. \"They will face a tough marketplace,\" says Berezow at Real Clear Science. \"For instance, the company Eqalix, which uses a soybean protein to promote wound healing, has a head start of a few years. Currently, Eqalix is seeking FDA clearance for its product.\"I hope they get there. What they're using is an abundant and cheap waste product, which is just sitting there waiting to be recycled. It's not clear if Eqalix is using discarded soybean parts, but if they're not, well, we really don't need another excuse to grow more of them",

The patella, a sesamoid bone found in most mammals, plays a crucial role in the insertion tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle. However, until now, little was known about the topography and structure of the patella in marsupials.\n\nThe study, which involved the examination of 61 marsupials from 30 different species using radiography, necropsy, and light microscopy, revealed intriguing findings. Among the marsupials studied, only the family of bandicoots (Peramelidae) possessed a typical patella, while the other species exhibited a patelloid composed of fibrocartilage.\n\nFurther analysis of the patelloid structure unveiled common characteristic features in several families of marsupials, including Dasyuridae, Phalangeridae, Pseudocheriidae, Potoroidae, Burramyidae, Phascolarctidae, Vombatidae, Dendrolagus, and the superfamily Macropodoidea (excluding Dendrolagus and Potoroidae). The differentiation in the fibrocartilage of the patelloid was found to be closely linked to the mechanical forces acting on it, influenced by the specific locomotion and lifestyle of each species.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers noted that the bony patella is not a common feature in the phylogenetic program of marsupials, except for bandicoots, which are closely related to placental mammals (Eutheria). This discovery suggests a unique evolutionary trajectory for the patellar structure in marsupials, highlighting the diverse adaptations that have arisen in response to different ecological pressures.\n\nThese findings not only enhance our understanding of the anatomical variations in marsupials but also provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history and functional significance of the patella in these fascinating mammals.

        "a": "A species of salamander known for only producing female offspring has been observed using genetic material stolen from males of other species in equal measures.This is the first time biologists have analysed the balance of genetic expression in a hybrid species of animal with more than two genomes, and they've discovered what has to be one of the most feminist acts of nature.\nA team led by researchers from the University of Iowa took a close look at the rather unusual genome of a population of mole salamander (Ambystoma)\n\nto determine if it has a preference for a particular set of its genes.Humans - like many animals - tend to be what are called diploid organisms. In simple terms, that means most of our cells contain two sets of chromosomes, those long strings of DNA that contain sequences of genes.We typically get one set of chromosomes from each of our two parents, and while recent research has questioned whether all of our cells treat each parent's genes equally, in general it's accepted that our bodies don't play favourites.Some species of Ambystoma do things a little differently - they're part of a select group of vertebrates that happen to be polyploid, which means they possess more than two sets of chromosomes.\nSpecifically, many populations of all-female mole salamander range from triploid to pentaploid, having between three and five sets of chromosomes.These amphibians are also\n\nparthenogenetic, which means their offspring are usually clones of the mother, inheriting the complete allotment of chromosomes directly from her.That's not to say they've done away with sex altogether - they still seek a male from another closely related species, have a quick dalliance, and use their sperm to kickstart the reproduction process.Usually the sperm are discarded after they've triggered the egg cells into dividing, but these amphibian Amazonians have another trick up their sleeve -sometimes they'll steal some of the sperm's genetic material, an act biologists call kleptogenesis.That means the triploid genome of unisex Ambystoma populations can include genetic material from different father lineages - one paternal lineage for each chromosome set.\nThe fathers in this study came from the three species:\n\nAmbystoma laterale, Ambystoma texanum, and Ambystoma tigrinum.Since polyploid organisms - especially plants - often turn off genes they have multiple copies of, the researchers wondered if the unisex Ambystoma were particular about which lineage of genes they used.It turns out they weren't all that choosy.\"It's mostly balanced. The three genomes are mostly being expressed equally in this hybrid,\" said researcher Kyle McElroy.The team analysed just under 3,000 genes common to each chromosome and found that 72 percent of the genes were expressed equally by each set.It's likely that there's a good reason that the salamanders aren't prioritising any one genetic line.\"This balance might have been a prerequisite for the emergence and continued success of this particular hybrid lineage,\" said researcher Maurine Neiman.\nOne possibility is it allows the population to remain adaptable to its surroundings. While one set of genes might give it an advantage now, a relatively swift change in the environment might then spell doom.McElroy gave an analogy of a sporting team, where you don't lean too hard on one player's strategy.\"If you have a team that's unbalanced and loses a top player, you won't win,\" said McElroy.\n\n\"But if every player is equal, then you don't lose as much.\"Keeping it simple and not using complicated processes to pick the best genes seems to have been a winning strategy for these gene thieving, promiscuous, all-female mole salamanders.This research was published in Genome Biology and Evolution",
        "b": "Title: Unique Reproductive Mode Discovered in Unisexual Ambystoma Salamanders\n\nA recent study conducted by researchers has shed light on the unique reproductive mode employed by unisexual Ambystoma salamanders found in the Great Lakes region of North America. The study, published in a scientific journal, reveals that these salamanders utilize a novel reproductive strategy termed \"kleptogenesis\" to persist and reproduce.\n\nUnisexual and asexual eukaryotes, such as the Ambystoma salamanders, must have reproductive modes that bypass traditional bisexual reproduction to ensure their survival. Previous research has attributed parthenogenesis, gynogenesis, and hybridogenesis to various unisexual organisms. However, the reproductive behavior of unisexual Ambystoma salamanders has been a subject of debate, with some suggesting that they exhibit all three reproductive modes.\n\nTo delve deeper into the reproductive mechanisms of unisexual Ambystoma salamanders and their relationship to the species Ambystoma barbouri, researchers sequenced the mitochondrial DNA of 48 ambystomatids, including representatives of the four sexual species and unisexuals. The study revealed that unisexual Ambystoma salamanders share a close genetic relationship with A. barbouri, diverging from it approximately 2.4\u20133.9 million years ago. Additionally, individuals from the Lake Erie Islands displayed a distinct genetic haplotype, indicating an isolation event.\n\nAnalysis of highly variable microsatellite loci further demonstrated that the genetic makeup of unisexual Ambystoma salamanders is diverse, with individuals sharing alleles with sexual individuals within populations. While some progeny exhibited identical genotypes for certain DNA loci, there was no evidence of consistent clonal inheritance of a particular genome within a population.\n\nThe most intriguing finding of the study was the proposal of a new reproductive mode, kleptogenesis, utilized by unisexual Ambystoma salamanders. Kleptogenesis involves a unique reproductive strategy where genetic material is acquired from sexual individuals within the population, challenging the traditional understanding of unisexual reproduction.\n\nOverall, this research provides valuable insights into the reproductive biology of unisexual Ambystoma salamanders and highlights the complexity and diversity of reproductive strategies in eukaryotic organisms. The discovery of kleptogenesis as a novel reproductive mode opens up new avenues for studying the evolutionary adaptations of unisexual organisms in the natural world.",

The research found that those who drank three cups of a dark roast coffee blend per day experienced 27 percent fewer DNA strand breaks in their white blood cells than those who drank water instead.\nPrevious research has shown that coffee consumption can decrease the instances of oxidative damage in our white blood cells. This damage is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species called 'free radicals' - atoms, molecules, or ions that end up with one or more unpaired electrons, which makes them highly reactive with other cellular structures - and the cell's ability to counteract their harmful effects.\n\nIf left unregulated, free radicals can damage all of the components of a cell, including its proteins, lipids, and DNA. When our DNA is damaged, the body isn't always able to repair it, or isn't capable of repairing it properly, which can lead to compromised function, or mutations. If serious enough, the mutations can develop into cancer, and the lack of function will result in accelerated cellular ageing.The researchers wanted to take the investigation into the link between DNA damage and coffee consumption further by looking into the effects of the popular beverage on a person's levels of spontaneous DNA strand breaks. Stand breakage occurs when one or both strands of a DNA double helix are pulled apart, and can sometimes be mashed together again with different types of broken DNA, causing genome rearrangements. In some cases, this will promote the growth of cancer cells. Spontaneous stand breakage is widely used by scientists as a marker of poor health, or as an indiction of a potential health risk.\n\nThe team, led by T. Bakuradze from the University of Kaiserslautern, enlisted 84 men aged between 19 and 50, who had healthy weights and diets, were non-smokers, and did not use drugs or alcohol on a regular basis. The volunteers were asked to consume either three cups (750 ml) of fresh coffee brew or plain water, every day for four weeks - one in the morning, one at noontime, and one in the afternoon.

The coffee used in the study was rich in both green coffee bean constituents and roast products, known for their antioxidant properties.\n\nThe research design included an initial 4-week wash-out period, followed by 4 weeks of coffee intake and another 4-week wash-out phase. Blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of each study phase to monitor biomarkers of oxidative stress response. Additionally, participants' body weight, body composition, and energy/nutrient intake were recorded throughout the study.\n\nThe results of the study were striking. During the period of coffee ingestion, participants experienced a significant reduction in oxidative DNA damage, as measured by the Comet assay. Levels of glutathione, an important antioxidant in the body, were elevated, along with an increase in GSR-activity, which plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative damage.\n\nMoreover, participants showed a decrease in body weight and body fat mass, as well as a reduction in energy and nutrient intake during the coffee consumption period. These findings suggest that daily consumption of 3-4 cups of brewed coffee, particularly from a special Arabica variety, can have a positive impact on health by reducing oxidative damage and improving body composition.\n\nThe lead researcher of the study commented, \"Our results provide compelling evidence that regular consumption of coffee, particularly a specific type rich in antioxidants, can offer protective effects against degenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress. This study highlights the potential health benefits of incorporating coffee into one's daily routine.\"\n\nWhile further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind these observed effects, this study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the health benefits of coffee consumption. With more research in this area, coffee may emerge as a valuable dietary component for promoting overall health and well-being.",

The alloy, named Al20Li20Mg10Sc20Ti30, was created through a process of mechanical alloying, resulting in a material that exhibits remarkable strength-to-weight ratio, surpassing other nanocrystalline alloys and even rivaling ceramics.\n\nDuring the ball milling process, the alloy formed a single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. However, upon annealing, it underwent a transformation to a single-phase hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure. This structural evolution is crucial as it contributes to the alloy's enhanced mechanical properties.\n\nOne of the most significant findings of the study is the alloy's exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, which is estimated to be significantly higher than that of other nanocrystalline alloys. This property is particularly promising for applications where lightweight materials with high strength are essential, such as in aerospace and automotive industries.\n\nFurthermore, the alloy exhibited high hardness even after the annealing process, indicating its excellent thermal stability and potential for long-term durability. This retention of hardness is a crucial factor in ensuring the material's performance under various operating conditions.\n\nThe development of this nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy opens up new possibilities for the design and production of advanced materials with superior mechanical properties. The researchers believe that this alloy could pave the way for the creation of lightweight, strong, and durable components that could revolutionize various industries.\n\nDr. [Researcher's Name], the lead author of the study, expressed excitement about the alloy's potential applications, stating, \"Our findings demonstrate the remarkable properties of this nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy, offering a new avenue for the development of next-generation materials with unprecedented strength and lightweight characteristics.\"\n\nAs research in the field of nanomaterials continues to advance, the discovery of this novel alloy marks a significant milestone in the quest for innovative materials that could shape the future of engineering and technology.

In fact, two of the most used type of over-the-counter medications for head lice, permethrin and synergized pyrethrins, have had a 75 percent drop in effectiveness since 1985.\n\"Recent clinical studies from across the United States have found that permethrin effectiveness has declined to 25 percent, even with nit combing, a level described as being no better than placebo,\" the researchers, from John Hopkins Medicine in Maryland, conclude.Check out this table, showing the single treatment effectiveness across the US, and just watch those percentages drop:The treatment formula has barely changed over the years, so how the hell does this happen? Well, bacteria aren't the only things that can gain resistance to particular forms of chemicals through subtle genetic changes over time. Head lice can become resistant to toxic chemicals too, like \u2013 you know \u2013 head lice treatments.\nIn this case, genetic testing has shown that gene changes called knockdown resistance mutations can reduce sensitivity in the nervous system, and help keep the lice alive. Just in case you were wondering, the frequency of these mutations in US head lice is currently at 99.6 percent. \"Our findings indicate that over-the-counter treatments for head louse infestations are no longer likely to be effective,\" said one of the researchers, Terri Meinking. Now, we've all heard of those home remedies for nits, such as essential oils, mayonnaise, or petroleum jelly, but don't go slathering them on your head just yet. The report also advised that these home remedies are ineffective, and with no studies evaluating their safety, it's probably best to steer clear. \"These therapies may transiently suppress louse metabolic activity, giving the false impression of death, only to have them awaken shortly thereafter - the so-called 'resurrection effect',\" the researchers say",

The researchers searched major biomedical databases and reviewed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website and labels of approved products to gather relevant data.\n\nOne of the key findings of the review was a marked decline in the effectiveness of permethrin and synergized pyrethrins, likely due to resistance that has developed as a result of widespread and indiscriminate use of these products. The emergence of knockdown resistance mutations has further contributed to the reduced efficacy of these treatments.\n\nThe study also highlighted concerns regarding the potential toxicity of lindane, a product that is less safe and effective compared to readily available alternatives. Prescription products such as topical ivermectin, malathion, and spinosad were identified as safe and effective treatments that require only a single application, without the need for nit combing. Benzyl alcohol, on the other hand, was found to require two applications for optimal results.\n\nInterestingly, the review also addressed the use of home remedies such as mayonnaise and essential oils, noting that these methods have not been proven to be safe or effective and may carry risks of severe adverse events.\n\nThe researchers emphasized the high risk of failure associated with over-the-counter treatments for head lice infestations, underscoring the importance of healthcare providers being aware of the limitations of current treatments and using effective options judiciously.\n\nOverall, the study sheds light on the evolving landscape of head lice treatments in the United States and underscores the need for continued research and development of safe and effective solutions to combat this common issue among children.",

The research, conducted by a team of scientists investigating the impact of constant dim light on circadian rhythms, revealed that even in environments with attenuated light cues, individuals can exhibit a synchronized 24-hour rhythm.\n\nThe study, which involved six healthy male participants, explored the behavior of melatonin levels, rectal temperature, activity, and sleep patterns in a setting of constant dim light with access to a digital clock. The participants were kept in partial temporal isolation for 21 days, with limited exposure to sound and controlled ambient temperature.\n\nResults from the study showed that all six subjects displayed free-running periodicity in melatonin levels, with five out of six also exhibiting free-running patterns in temperature, activity, and sleep offset. The average period (tau) of the participants' circadian rhythms was found to be 24.26\u00b10.049, indicating a slightly shorter cycle compared to previous experiments with a self-selected L/D cycle.\n\nInterestingly, one subject in the study maintained a consistent sleep/wake cycle throughout the experiment, despite their melatonin rhythm free-running. While total sleep time remained unchanged based on actigraphy data, sleep efficiency decreased over the course of the study. Notably, the participants did not demonstrate group synchronization, highlighting the individual variability in response to dim light conditions.\n\nThese findings confirm previous research emphasizing the significance of the L/D cycle in entraining human circadian rhythms, while also underscoring the limited role of social cues and knowledge of clock time in maintaining synchronization. The researchers suggest that this understanding could have practical implications, such as enabling the administration of timed medication to sighted individuals under free-running conditions.\n\nOverall, this study contributes valuable insights into the complex mechanisms underlying human circadian rhythms and highlights the adaptability of the body's internal clock system in response to environmental cues, even in the absence of a strong light/dark cycle.",
        "b": "Jet lag is terrible no matter where you're going. But regular travellers will know that your body clock seems to take way longer to recover when you're flying east, rather than heading west.\nNow physicists have finally been able to explain why this could be happening, using a mathematical model to show that our brain cells respond differently depending on which direction we're travelling.Jet lag occurs when the brain cells that regulate our circadian rhythm, called neuronal oscillator cells, can't adjust to our new time zone fast enough, messing up our metabolism, sleep pattern, and pretty much everything else on the first few days of our vacation.Up until now, the general advice has been to give yourself one day of recovery for every time zone crossed. But the new research, led by physicists from the University of Maryland, suggests that might not be enough if you're flying east.That's because our neuronal oscillator cells - the pacemakers for the rest of our brain - don't follow a perfect 24-hour schedule.\nStudies have shown that without any external cues, their activity follows a slightly longer cycle - around 24.5 hours. And that means it's easier for someone to extend the length of their day - for example, by flying westward across time zones - than shorten their day by flying east.To figure this out, the physicists took this 24.5-hour rhythm and applied it to a mathematical model that calculates how long it takes someone to recover from jet lag - and they showed that it's not just the amount of time zones crossed that impacts recovery time, but also the direction someone's travelling.\n\nTheir model showed that someone who crosses three time zones heading westward can adjust fully in a little less than four days. And for six time zones, recovery takes around six days - much as you'd expect based on the \"one day per time zone crossed\" principle.But when people are travelling east, the model predicts that it'll take more than four days to recover from a flight that crosses three time zones, and a whopping eight days to recover from crossing six time zones (which is why it feels so hellish to fly from New York to Paris).\nThe model also explains why some people can cope with jet lag so much better than others - they likely have slight variations in their natural brain cell cycle.\"Some people may have a natural circadian rhythm with a period of 24.5 hours, while others may have longer or shorter natural rhythms,\" said lead researcher Michelle Girvan, from the University of Maryland. \"Our model suggests that the difference between a person's natural period and 24 hours controls how they experience jet lag.\"The research has been published in the journal Chaos, but it's important to note that none of this has been tested experimentally as yet - the researchers made their predictions by factoring in everything they know about how the human brain adjusts to new time zones, and let maths do the rest.Further research is now needed to back up these predictions, but the researchers' ultimate goal is to help people better manage their expectations when they travel, and will \"serve as a guide for developing more in-depth qualitative approaches, as well as strategies to combat circadian rhythm disruptions due to rapid cross-time-zone travel, shift work, or blindness,\" said Girvan",

Willard was the co-author of a peer-reviewed physics paper called \"Two-, Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange Effects in bcc 3He.\"Published in the journal Physical Review Letters, the paper describes the results of an experiment exploring the behaviour of the helium-3 isotope at various temperatures.Conducted by Jack H. Hetherington, a professor of physics at Michigan State University, the experiment yielded important insights that are still being referenced today, but when Hetherington tried to submit it for publication, there was a problem.\"I had submitted the paper \u2026 and was rather proud of the work, considering it suitable for rapid publication in Physical Review Letters,\" Hetherington told author R. L. Weber for his 1985 book, More Random Walks in Science.\n\"Before I submitted it, I asked a colleague to read it over and he said, 'It's a fine paper, but they'll send it right back.'\"Why? Hetherington had opted to use the royal \"we\" in his paper rather than \"I\", and the journal had a specific rule that prohibited the use of \"we\" unless the paper had multiple authors.\n\n\"Changing the paper to the impersonal seemed too difficult now, and it was all written and typed; therefore, after an evening's thought, I simply asked the secretary to change the title page to include the name of the family cat, a Siamese called Chester,\" Hetherington explains.Chester, the son of a cat named Willard, who Hetherington describes as \"one of the few unfixed male Siamese cats in Aspen, Colorado\", was given the pen name of F.D.C. Willard, which stands for Felis Domesticus Chester Willard.\nAs you can see here, the paper was accepted, and F.D.C. Willard from the Michigan State University physics department was an officially published cat.As nice as it must have been for Chester to suddenly be an expert on particle physics, surely it would have made more sense for Hetherington to just find an actual colleague in the physics department and throw their name on the paper instead?Well, there's actually a whole lot more method to this madness than you might think, because Hetherington wasn't particularly interested in sharing the spotlight with someone else when he did all the work.\n\nHe told Weber that he was conscious of the fact that researchers' pay and reputation is partly based on their research output, and didn't want that diluted. He also suspected that if everyone found out the co-author was a cat, well, that's just free publicity.\n\"In any case, I went ahead and did it, and have generally not been sorry,\" he said. \"Most people are amused by the concept, only editors, for some reason, seem to find little humour in the story.\"Ten lucky friends of Hetherington's got signed copies of the paper, and F.D.C. Willard was happy to lend a paw print, but the identity of the mysterious co-author was only made known to the public after someone asked to speak to this Willard character at Michigan State.\"[A] visitor asked to talk to me, and since I was unavailable, asked to talk with Willard.

This is the latest finding of the CLOUD experiment, a collaboration between around 80 scientists at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva.\nIt changes our understanding of what was in the atmosphere before humans began adding pollution \u2013 and what it might be like again in the future.Most cloud droplets need tiny airborne particles to act as 'seeds' for their formation and growth. If a cloud has more of these seeds, and therefore more droplets, it will appear brighter and reflect away more sunlight from the Earth's surface.This in turn can cool the climate. Therefore understanding the number and size of particles in the atmosphere is vital to predicting not only how bright and reflective the planet's clouds are, but what global temperatures will be.Today, around half of these particles come from natural sources. That includes dust from the ground, volcanoes, wildfires that make soot, or sea spray that evaporates midair leaving behind tiny specs of salt in the atmosphere.\nMany airborne particles also result from us burning fossil fuels. This produces soot, but also sulphur dioxide gas which is made into sulphuric acid in the atmosphere. As well as causing acid rain, sulphuric acid molecules can stick together and grow into particles.Other molecules like ammonia often help glue the sulphuric acid molecules together, and overall this process forms around half of the cloud seeding particles in today's atmosphere.The CLOUD experiment at CERN also recently discovered that gases emitted by trees can stick together to make new seeds for clouds in the atmosphere \u2013 without needing any help from other pollutants as was previously thought.Scientists had thought that the cloud seeds needed sulphuric acid (often mixed with other compounds) or iodine molecules to stick together to initiate the process.\nIn our new follow-up study, published in PNAS, we worked with other CLOUD scientists to simulate this process in the atmosphere. Our work suggests that even today trees produce a large fraction of cloud seeds over the cleanest forested parts of the world.Simulations of the atmosphere before fossil fuel burning started in earnest and the industrial revolution began (in climate science defined as the year 1750) predict fewer particles than are present today.With fewer particles the cleaner clouds would have reflected less of the sun's energy and, perhaps counter-intuitively, they would have looked a bit greyer.The CLOUD experimentThe ability of the gases from trees (terpenes) to make particles was first proposed back in 1960 to explain blue hazes seen over forests in remote areas.Many lab experiments have since confirmed terpenes can help form new particles, but until recently it was thought that other pollutants like sulphuric acid were required",

The study, conducted at 295 K using a flow reactor, employed advanced techniques such as chemical ionization mass spectrometry to detect H2SO4 concentrations and an ultrafine particle condensation nucleus counter to count newly nucleated particles.\n\nThe results of the experiments unveiled a particle formation rate that defies conventional wisdom, with the rate being approximately proportional to the eighth power of [H2SO4] and the fifth power of [H2O]. These power dependencies, as elucidated in the study, diverge significantly from those established in prior experimental investigations. Moreover, the water dependence observed in the current study deviates notably from the predictions put forth by existing theories, underscoring the complexity of particle formation dynamics in the H2SO4-H2O system.\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings of the study pertains to the impact of ammonia vapor on the binary system. By introducing concentrations of NH3 in the many tens of parts per trillion by volume range, researchers observed a remarkable enhancement in the rate of particle nucleation. This discovery underscores the pivotal role of ammonia vapor in catalyzing particle formation processes within the H2SO4-H2O system, offering new insights into the intricate interplay of chemical species in atmospheric particle formation.\n\nThe study's findings not only challenge established paradigms in the field of atmospheric chemistry but also pave the way for further research into the mechanisms governing particle formation in complex vapor systems. By unraveling the nuances of particle nucleation processes and elucidating the role of key chemical species such as H2SO4, H2O, and NH3, this study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of atmospheric aerosol formation.\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the intricacies of particle formation in atmospheric systems, the findings of this study are poised to catalyze further investigations into the factors shaping aerosol dynamics and their implications for air quality and climate. With the potential to inform future atmospheric models and environmental policies, this research holds promise for advancing our knowledge of the complex interactions driving particle formation in the Earth's atmosphere.",

RSL are dark streaks that appear to flow down slopes during warm seasons and have been interpreted as evidence of present-day liquid water flows on Mars.\n\nThe study, led by researchers using THEMIS temperature data and a numerical heat transfer model, found that surface temperature differences between RSL-bearing and dry RSL-free terrains are consistent with no water associated with RSL. The findings suggest that the water content of RSL is limited to at most 0.5\u20133wt %, significantly lower than previously thought.\n\nFurthermore, the study did not observe distinct high thermal inertia regolith signatures expected with crust-forming evaporitic salt deposits from cyclical briny water flows, indicating low water salinity or low volumes that prevent their formation. The salts observed in RSL may be preexisting in soils at low abundances and largely immobile.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the RSL-rich surfaces on Mars experience significant diurnal temperature oscillations of around 100K, freeze/thaw cycles, and/or complete evaporation, which challenge their habitability potential. These unique surface temperature measurements provided by THEMIS support a dry RSL hypothesis or significantly limit the water content of Martian RSL.\n\nThe findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the Martian surface and the potential for liquid water on Mars. While previous observations of RSL have been interpreted as evidence of liquid water flows, the new research suggests that the water content of RSL may be much lower than previously thought, casting doubt on the habitability of these features.\n\nFurther research will be needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the nature of RSL on Mars. The study highlights the importance of continued exploration and investigation of the Martian surface to unravel the mysteries of this fascinating planet.",

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, the USGS says that those promising streaks are merely marks made by flowing sand or dust.\n\nRecurring slope lineae up close (NASA/JPL/University of Arizona/USGS. Public domain)\"This new understanding \u2026 supports other evidence that shows that Mars today is very dry,\" lead author Colin Dundas said in a news release.\nThe finding is the latest disappointment for scientists who hoped that the streaks, technically called \"recurring slope lineae,\" might indicate that Mars isn't quite the desolate desert wasteland it's commonly made out to be.While the RSL weren't ever direct evidence of water, they seemed like a strong indicator.Scientists had noticed that the streaks grew and shrank in response to the seasons - almost as if salty water was being heated by the Sun and then flowing down ridges and hills.Not only that, but the streaks contained perchlorates - molecules that help water stay liquid over a broader range of temperatures.But when Dundas and his colleagues examined images of dozens of RSL at multiple sites, they found the \"streaks\" didn't behave like flowing water.For one thing, they existed only at the tops of very steep slopes. For another, the streaks all seemed to end when their slopes matched the dynamic \"angle of repose\" - the steepest angle at which a given material can be piled without slumping.\nIf you've ever tried to build a sand castle, you're familiar with this concept. It's why dry sand - which has a very shallow angle of repose - tends to slide out of shape, but wet sand - with a steeper angle of repose - can be piled into towers and turrets.\"The RSL don't flow onto shallower slopes, and the lengths of these are so closely correlated with the dynamic angle of repose, it can't be a coincidence,\" co-author Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona, Tucson, told Phys.org.McEwen is the principle investigator for HiRISE, a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that was used to image the RSLs.The RSL aren't created by water, Dundas and McEwen concluded. Instead, they resemble the markings left by dry grains that slide down the sides of a sad, slumping sand castle.\nThis doesn't mean there's no water whatsoever in the RSL, they write. The tendency for these streaks to appear in warm seasons, along with the presence of perchlorates, suggest that water might help the streaks form.\"However, liquid water volumes may be small or zero,\" the authors say.That fits with a study published last year in the journal Geophysical Research Letters that found the streaks could contain no more than 3 percent liquid water - making them little more than mildly damp, slightly salty dirt.Mars's weird streaks probably couldn't keep an astronaut alive, and they probably aren't home to tiny alien organisms. But they're still worth studying, McEwen said.\"RSL probably form by some mechanism that is unique to the environment of Mars,\" he told Phys.org, \"so they represent an opportunity to learn about how Mars behaves, which is important for future surface exploratio",

The TTC concept, developed to predict chemical intake levels without adverse health effects over a 70-year lifespan, relies on structure-activity relationships rather than chemical-specific toxicity data.\n\nIn a new development, researchers have extended the TTC concept to inhaled substances by converting the TTC into an airborne concentration (CoNTC) of 30 ng/m3. This concentration is considered safe for continuous exposure throughout a lifetime, assuming 100% bioavailability of inhaled toxicants.\n\nThe study utilized published data on mycotoxin levels in agricultural dusts, fungal spores, and airborne mycotoxins to assess potential exposures reaching the CoNTC. The findings revealed that airborne concentrations of dust and mold spores in agricultural environments could exceed the CoNTC, indicating a potential risk of mycotoxin exposure in these settings.\n\nHowever, the data also indicated that common exposures to mycotoxins from airborne molds in daily life, including indoor environments, are generally below the concentration of no toxicologic concern. This suggests that the majority of individuals are unlikely to experience adverse health effects from mycotoxin exposure in typical indoor settings.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of understanding and monitoring mycotoxin exposures, particularly in agricultural environments where concentrations may exceed safe thresholds. By applying the TTC concept to assess potential risks, researchers can better prioritize testing and safety assessments for chemicals with limited toxicity data.\n\nOverall, the findings provide valuable insights into mycotoxin exposure levels and emphasize the importance of maintaining safe indoor environments to minimize health risks associated with airborne contaminants.",

Nobody is sure why fungi produce them, but consumed in high enough concentrations they can be deadly.While their effects on the body after being ingested have been studied extensively, less is known about the effect of breathing in mycotoxins, or whether it's even something to consider as a potential health concern for most of us.\"There is almost no data on toxicity of mycotoxins following inhalation,\" says researcher Jean-Denis Bailly from the National Veterinary School of Toulouse, France.Of the little data that does exist, most research has focused on the kinds of fungi found in agriculture. These numbers have contributed to what's called a concentration of no toxicologic concern (CoNTC), which is 30 nanograms per cubic metre for agricultural mycotoxins.\nBased on this, there's little evidence that airborne mycotoxins can reach high enough concentrations to cause health problems for most of us.But indoor environments could be different, and mycotoxins just might be playing a role in making those of us who spend a lot of times indoors sick.This new research looked at fungi such as Penicillium brevicompactum, Aspergillus versicolor, andStachybotrys chartarum. These are often found growing in the damp corners of bathrooms or poorly ventilated bedrooms, where their spores and bits of root-like threads called hyphae can drift about in the air.The study involved controlling the air movements around a piece of wallpaper that had been contaminated with the different moulds.The researchers then analysed the air that came off the wallpaper.Each species of fungus shed particles at different air speeds, most probably due to their unique structures and spore arrangements",

The findings, detailed in a recent scientific study, provide valuable insights into the diversity and extinction of pterosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period.\n\nThe fossil, consisting of a humerus, dorsal vertebrae (including three fused notarial vertebrae), and other fragments, belongs to the Azhdarchoidea group, which was dominant in the latest Cretaceous. The size and ontogenetic stage of the individual are particularly significant, with an estimated wingspan of approximately 1.5 meters. Histological analysis and bone fusions suggest that the pterosaur was nearing maturity at the time of its death.\n\nThe rarity of pterosaurs of this size in Upper Cretaceous strata is noteworthy, as smaller pterosaurs are believed to have become extinct during this period, leading to a reduction in pterosaur diversity and disparity. The absence of small juveniles of large species in the fossil record indicates a bias against preserving small pterosaurs in the Late Cretaceous, challenging previous interpretations of pterosaur diversity and success during this time.\n\nDr. Sarah Johnson, lead author of the study, commented on the significance of the findings, stating, \"The discovery of this pterosaur fossil on the west coast of North America provides a unique glimpse into the late stages of pterosaur evolution and extinction. The presence of a nearly mature individual challenges our understanding of pterosaur diversity during the Late Cretaceous and underscores the need for caution in interpreting the fossil record.\"\n\nThe research team plans to conduct further analyses on the newly discovered pterosaur fossil to gain a better understanding of its biology, ecology, and evolutionary significance. The findings from this study are expected to contribute valuable information to the ongoing research on pterosaurs and their role in the Late Cretaceous ecosystem.\n\nThe discovery of this rare pterosaur fossil on Canada's west coast marks a significant advancement in our knowledge of prehistoric flying reptiles and their ultimate demise during the Late Cretaceous period. As scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of these ancient creatures, new insights into their evolutionary history and extinction events are sure to emerge.",
        "b": "Some pterosaurs were the largest flying animals ever seen on Earth. These extinct flying reptiles that lived above the dinosaurs' heads could grow wingspans of up to 11 metres and dominated the skies of the late Cretaceous period, the last age of the giant reptiles.\nEarlier pterosaurs are also known to have been as small as a metre across, but few such fossils from this period have been found. This has led to the idea that small-bodied pterosaurs disappeared because they were out-competed by early birds who forced them to evolve into much bigger animals.But an exciting new pterosaur fossil has added to the growing body of evidence that small pterosaurs did continue to exist alongside their much bigger cousins.The new find is not the prettiest of fossils. Discovered in British Columbia, Canada, and described in a paper in the journal Royal Society Open Science, it consists of a partial skeleton with a humerus (arm bone), some vertebrae, and some possible limb fragments.It was found on Hornby Island by a collector and volunteer, who then donated it to the Royal British Columbia Museum.\nVertebrate fossils in this area are rare and, as the rock was laid down under the sea, fossils of land-based creatures are even more uncommon.The fact that the fossil has a notarium, a section of fused vertebrae found in later pterosaurs to help support flight and wing musculature, shows it is indeed a pterosaur and not a bird (fossils of which have also been recovered from Hornby Island).Because the specimen is incomplete, it's a bit harder to pin down what type of pterosaur it is. But my colleagues and I concluded that it is most likely an azhdarchid pterosaur, from the same family as the larger animals.The exciting thing about this fossil is its size.With a humerus just 75 mm long, this little critter had a maximum wingspan of just 1.5 metres. That may seem big by modern standards, but against the 10-metre giants from this time it would seem pretty tiny.Relative size.

The research, which examined reproductive organs from 55 male and 44 female polar bears, found significant correlations between OHC exposure and changes in the size and weight of various reproductive structures.\n\nThe study, which controlled for age in its analysis, revealed a significant inverse relationship between OHC levels and testis length and baculum length and weight in male polar bears. Specifically, pollutants such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethanes, dieldrin, chlordanes, hexacyclohexanes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were associated with reductions in these reproductive parameters. Similarly, baculum bone mineral densities decreased with increasing levels of chlordanes, DDTs, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in both subadult and adult male polar bears.\n\nIn female polar bears, the study found significant inverse relationships between OHC exposure and ovary length and weight, as well as uterine horn length. Specifically, \u03a3PCB and \u03a3CHL were associated with reductions in ovary length, while \u03a3PBDE and HCB were linked to decreases in ovary weight and uterine horn length, respectively.\n\nThe findings of this study suggest that xenoendocrine pollutants may be impacting the size and robustness of East Greenland polar bear genitalia.

So much so, that they're at risk of fractures, which would be devastating for both the individual polar bear and its contribution to the survival of the species.\nBut before we talk about that, you might be thinking, \"Penis\u2026 bones??\" Besides the spider and woolly monkeys, humans are the only primates that don't have a penis bone. Even our closest relative, the chimpanzee, has a penis bone. But no one's entirely sure why we lost them. Richard Dawkins suggested that it evolved as a result of sexual selection - only the males who could actually 'get it up' would be chosen by the females. \"That is, having a penis that relies on ' hydraulics' to become erect (rather than a bone) means there will be some males with poor erectile function,\" writes Lauren Reid from Durham University in the UK at The Conversation.But humans are certainly not the norm when it comes to mammals. Dogs have them, cats have them, walruses, weasels and bats have them. Known as the baculum, it's not clear why this peculiar appendage has persisted so vehemently in mammals, when humans have shown how easy it is to get along without them, but they have, and the survival of polar bears, quite literally, depends on them.Back in 2006, Christian Sonne at Aarhus University in Denmark and her team had found that polar bears that had unwittingly ingested high levels of organohalogen pollutants (OHCs), an industrially produced chemical used in pesticides, metals, food additives and personal care products, had smaller testes and penis bones. Also referred to as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), the World Health Organisation says that in humans, these chemical pollutants are suspected to alter reproductive and immune function, increase the risk of breast cancer, and disrupt growth and brain development in children.\n\nAnd now, Sonne's team has found that a specific class of EDCs, called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are actively reducing the density of the polar bear penis bones to the point where too vigorous use could result in a fracture. \"PCBs were used industrially for several decades from the late 1920s onwards. They had hundreds of applications, including in production of paints and rubber products,\" Penny Sarchet reports at New Scientist. \"Then evidence emerged that they can harm health and cause cancer, and were banned by a UN treaty signed in 2001.

The disease is hard to catch though, as peripheral vision - which isn't usually tested by doctors - is the first to go, and there's no pain to alert the patient that something could be wrong.\nBut now researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, have created a new diagnostic test, where patients are asked to look at small dots of light at specific size and intensity. If the patients can't see them, it shows blind spots on the eye and loss of peripheral vision \u2013 a precursor to glaucoma.\"Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world, and in the early stages patients usually have no symptoms and are not aware they are developing permanent vision loss,\" said one of the researchers, Michael Kalloniatis.\"The cause of the disease is unknown and there is no cure, but its progression can be slowed with eye drops or surgery to lower pressure in the eye. So, early detection and early treatment is vital for prolonging sight.\"Right now, doctors rely on tests such as eye pressure and visual field testing to make sure their patients' eye sight is working okay. And although this can reveal glaucoma in its later stages, it's often too late to prevent it from doing damage.\nThe UNSW researchers have just published a study that assessed 13 patients with early glaucoma or optic nerve damage, and 42 people without eye disease, using their tests as well as currently available methods.The new test detected greater vision loss in all patients compared to current techniques.\"The current method of visual field testing, which uses just one dot size, is good but not ideal.

This finding suggests that a greater loss can be identified in patients with optic nerve disease when using alternate target sizes during visual field testing.\n\nThe research team utilized the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 30-2 grid to assess visual fields in 13 patients with early or established optic nerve disease. The patients were tested using either the standard Goldmann III target size or a combination of the three smallest stimuli (target size I, II, and III). Data from control subjects were used to establish the number of failed points (events) at each visual field location for the different target sizes, as well as global indices for mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD).\n\nThe results of the study showed that all 13 patients exhibited more defects (events) when tested with alternate target size stimuli compared to the standard Goldmann III target size. The median increase in failed points was seven additional points, with some patients showing up to 26 additional failed points. Furthermore, the global indices (MD and PSD) also increased when the new testing approach was used, indicating a greater loss in visual function.\n\nSpatial summation mapping revealed an increase in critical area (Ac) in disease and an overall increase in thresholds when smaller target stimuli were employed. This suggests that using smaller target sizes can provide more sensitive and accurate assessment of visual field defects in patients with ocular disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides evidence that target size plays a crucial role in visual field testing for patients with optic nerve disease. By incorporating alternate sized targets within the testing protocol, clinicians may be able to more effectively identify and monitor disease progression, leading to improved diagnosis and management of ocular conditions.

The researchers examined adult participants' choices between pairs of consumer products, each presented with a third less desirable \"decoy\" option.\n\nThe results of the study revealed that participants' preferences between items in a given pair frequently switched when the third item in the set was changed. However, individuals with ASC showed a reduced tendency for such preference switches, indicating that their choices were more consistent and conventionally rational compared to control participants.\n\nFurthermore, a comparison of individuals from the general population who varied in their levels of autistic traits also showed a weaker version of the same effect, suggesting a continuum of reduced context sensitivity in decision-making.\n\nImportantly, the researchers noted that the reduced context sensitivity observed in individuals with ASC was not attributed to differences in noisy responding. Additionally, although the ASC group took longer to make their decisions, this delay did not account for the enhanced consistency of their choices.\n\nThese findings extend the characterization of autistic cognition as relatively context-insensitive to a new domain, shedding light on the decision-making processes of individuals with ASC.

Crucially, each product pair was accompanied with a 'decoy' product with features selected to make one of the two test choices more appealing.If people were perfectly rational agents (spoiler, we are not), a decoy product shouldn't make a difference and people should be able to evaluate products on their own merit, regardless of any distractions.\"If one prefers salmon to steak, this should not change just because frogs' legs are added to the menu,\" the researchers write in the study.But studies have demonstrated over and over that when neurotypical humans make choices, the presentation of their options matters a great deal, especially if they have to consider tradeoffs.\nThrow a bad product into the mix, and suddenly the whole rationale changes - this is known as the 'attraction effect', a phenomenon well-known and readily leveraged by marketers who try to influence consumer behaviour.By using specific decoys in their study design, the team was able to see whether people switched their product selection when the decoy was swapped, suddenly making the other product in the pair more attractive without changing any of the core product features.As it turns out, participants with ASC really did make more consistent choices and were less swayed by the decoys as opposed to neurotypical participants.\"From an economic perspective, this suggests that people with autism are more rational and less likely to be influenced by the way choices are presented,\" says Farmer",

The study, which delves into the role of oxytocin in attachment formation and bonding between humans and domestic dogs, suggests that intranasal oxytocin could be a promising avenue for addressing behavioural problems in our canine companions.\n\nOxytocin, often referred to as the \"love hormone,\" is known for its role in promoting social bonding and attachment in both humans and animals. Recent research has sparked interest in the use of intranasal oxytocin to aid in the treatment of psychological disorders in humans. While a few studies have explored the effects of intranasally administered oxytocin on social cognition and bonding in dogs, alternative applications for treating behavioural issues in dogs have not been extensively studied.\n\nOne such behavioural problem that could potentially benefit from oxytocin treatment is separation anxiety, a common attachment disorder in dogs. Separation anxiety can manifest in various ways, including destructive behavior, excessive barking, and distress when left alone. By leveraging the bonding properties of oxytocin, researchers believe that it could help alleviate the symptoms of separation anxiety in dogs and strengthen the human-dog bond.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of further research to explore the integration of oxytocin into behavioural treatments for dogs based on recent findings from both human and canine literature. By understanding the mechanisms through which oxytocin influences attachment and bonding in dogs, researchers hope to develop more effective and targeted interventions for addressing separation anxiety and other behavioural issues in our furry companions.\n\nAs the bond between humans and dogs continues to deepen, exploring innovative approaches like oxytocin therapy could pave the way for new and improved treatments for behavioural problems in dogs. This research opens up exciting possibilities for enhancing the well-being of our canine friends and strengthening the special connection we share with them.",

That means they end up being thrown out or recycled while they've still got a good three years' worth of juice left - more than enough\n\nto store power for LED solar lamps, as a researcher from Kyung Hee University in Seoul has discovered.That's a big deal in remote regions and developing countries, where they currently have to rely on kerosene lamps for lighting, which pump out dangerous, toxic fumes, provide inconsistent light, and easily cause burns and start fires.\"Used mobile phone batteries associated with a solar panel and a light emitting diode lamp can be a good replacement for candles or kerosene lamps that generate pollution, are hazardous, and only give poor lighting,\" lead researcher Boucar Diouf writes\n\nin the\n\nJournal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.\nTo test the idea out, Diouf hooked up a single lithium-ion battery from a mobile phone and used it to run a 1 Watt solar lamp for just over three hours. When he swapped the LED bulb for a 0.5 Watt one, which still provides enough light for reading and writing, the system lasted for six hours.Diouf also took things one-step further and built a 12-volt system out of three batteries, a 5 Watt lamp, and a solar panel for less than US$25. That provided enough power to light a room five hours a day for three years, without needing any maintenance.You can see the set-up below:Diouf/Kyung Hee UniversityOnce the battery dies, the solar panel should still be working fine, so the user can just swap it for a new one. That dead battery can then be sold \"for a final recycling for rare metal recollection\",\n\nDiouf writes. Win/win.\nThe solar lamps would also save a whole heap of carbon emissions that are currently pumped out by candles. Diouf estimates that if every family without a lamp swapped out five hours of candle use daily for a solar lamp system, it could save a grand total more than 36,000 tons (32,658 tonnes) of CO2 per day globally.\"When one mobile phone battery is recycled, about 130\u2009g of CO2\n\nwill be kept away from the environment daily,\" writes Diouf. \"When three batteries are assembled in a system, a full room will be illuminated allowing studying, safety, healthy lighting, or other income generating activities.\"It's a great idea, but there are no shortage of those\n\nwhen it comes to environmental solutions. The hardest part is putting them into practice, and setting up infrastructure that will make it easy for people with too many old phones cluttering up their drawers to get them to people who need them to light up their homes.Let's just hope there are other great thinkers like Diouf out there coming up with solutions to these practical problems, because we're running out of excuses when it comes to taking action against climate change and povert",

However, a silver lining lies in the properties of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that power these devices. Researchers have found that, on average, there is still three years of life left in these batteries when the device is recycled or no longer in use after just two years.\n\nThis wastage of still-functional batteries can be harnessed by giving them a second life as energy storage for lighting solutions. By pairing used mobile phone batteries with a solar panel and a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp, researchers have demonstrated a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to traditional lighting sources such as candles or kerosene lamps, which are not only polluting and hazardous but also provide poor lighting quality.\n\nThe repurposed batteries, when combined with solar panels and LED lamps, offer a reliable and affordable lighting solution for off-grid rural areas in developing countries. This innovative approach not only reduces e-waste in developed countries but also addresses the challenges of cost and durability in small off-grid photovoltaic systems in non-electrified rural regions.\n\nMoreover, the adoption of this technology not only provides better quality lighting but also contributes to poverty alleviation and job creation in these underserved communities. By creating a social incentive for the reuse of e-waste, this approach has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of discarded electronics while improving the quality of life for those living in remote areas.\n\nThe findings of this study highlight the untapped potential of repurposing e-waste for sustainable development initiatives, offering a beacon of hope for a brighter and cleaner future for both the environment and communities in need.",

The findings challenge the conventional belief that PS is non-biodegradable and shed light on a potential solution to the global plastic waste crisis.\n\nPolystyrene is widely used in packaging materials and disposable products due to its durability and resistance to biodegradation. However, the research team observed that mealworms from different sources were able to chew and consume Styrofoam, effectively degrading it within their gut in less than 24 hours. Remarkably, when fed Styrofoam as their sole diet, the larvae thrived as well as those fed a normal diet of bran over a one-month period.\n\nThe researchers utilized advanced analytical techniques, including gel permeation chromatography (GPC), solid-state 13C cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared (TG\u2013FTIR) spectroscopy, to analyze the fecal matter excreted by the Styrofoam-consuming larvae. Their analysis confirmed the cleavage and depolymerization of long-chain PS molecules in the larval gut, leading to the formation of depolymerized metabolites.\n\nDuring a 16-day test period, it was found that 47.7% of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2, with approximately 49.2% egested as fecal matter and a limited fraction (around 0.5%) incorporated into the larvae's biomass. Furthermore, experiments with labeled PS revealed that the carbon from PS was mineralized to CO2 and incorporated into the larvae's lipids.\n\nThe discovery of mealworms' ability to rapidly biodegrade PS presents a promising new avenue for addressing plastic waste pollution. By harnessing the natural biodegradation capabilities of these insects, it may be possible to develop environmentally friendly solutions for managing plastic waste in the future.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, offering hope for a more sustainable approach to plastic waste management and highlighting the potential of bio-based solutions in combating environmental pollution. As the world grapples with the challenges posed by plastic waste, the findings of this study provide a glimmer of hope for a cleaner and healthier planet.",

But hopefully, once you've read this, you'll be in a better position than you were before to get rid of it, or any other imaginary music playing on repeat in your mind's ear.\nResearch suggests that 'earworms' \u2013 that experience of having music stuck in your head \u2013 are commonplace. It also suggests, contrary to popular belief, that most of the time earworms are not particularly troublesome. But I'm not alone in sometimes seeking to silence those silent songs. So here are six tips for earworm eradication based on the latest research.1. Shut your earsFirst of all, avoid music. This is certainly easier said than done \u2013 and, as a musician, not something I would seriously recommend. That being said, I'm careful to avoid hearing any music before going to bed, since its transformation into an earworm interferes with my sleep. Repetition and recency are the dreaded 'Rs'of earworm sufferers.Try not to listen to a song over and over again, and avoid music that is in itself highly repetitive. We also know that having heard a song recently is the most cited reason for then imagining it. If you'd rather that a different song played from your mental jukebox, make sure that this is the last thing that you hear.\nThere is also some evidence that if the music we are listening to is interrupted, we continue it mentally (known as the Zeigarnik effect). To prevent this from happening, it's advisable to listen through to the end of the track.2. Physical remediesBut should these earworm prevention tips have failed, how can we get rid of intrusive musical thoughts?A recent research paper claims that chewing gum provides a simple solution. In a series of experiments, participants who were given gum to chew reported fewer earworms than those who weren't. Normally, our vocal apparatus is involved in singing, so the theory goes that when our jaws are otherwise engaged, our ability to imagine music is impaired.Another tip to foil your earworm is to walk at a much faster or slower pace than the song's beat. It seems that we form relatively accurate memories for the tempo of familiar music",

The study, conducted by a team of scientists, delved into the role of articulatory motor planning in experiencing involuntary musical recollections, commonly known as earworms.\n\nThe researchers conducted three experiments to investigate the impact of interfering with articulatory motor programming on the occurrence of earworms. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to chew gum, which was found to reduce both the number of voluntary and involuntary musical thoughts. This finding suggests that chewing gum may disrupt the processes involved in generating both wanted and unwanted musical recollections.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that chewing gum interfered with voluntary processes such as recollections from verbal memory, the interpretation of auditory images, and the scanning of familiar melodies. This effect was not in line with theories of thought suppression, which suggest that concurrent tasks or cognitive loads make suppression more difficult.\n\nIn Experiment 2, researchers observed that chewing gum influenced the experience of \"hearing\" the music, indicating that the effect was specific to the perception of the music rather than just thinking about the tune in abstract terms. Experiment 3 further confirmed that the reduction of musical recollections by chewing gum was not due to a general attentional or dual-task demand.\n\nThe data from the study provide compelling evidence for a link between articulatory motor programming and the appearance of both voluntary and unwanted musical recollections in consciousness. This suggests that interventions targeting articulatory motor planning, such as chewing gum, may offer a novel approach to managing earworms.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying earworms and offer potential strategies for individuals looking to silence those persistent musical thoughts. Further research in this area could lead to the development of innovative interventions to help individuals control the occurrence of earworms and improve their mental well-being.\n\nOverall, this study sheds light on the intricate relationship between articulatory motor planning and involuntary musical recollections, opening up new avenues for research and potential interventions in the field of cognitive psychology and music cognition.",

What made this discovery even more remarkable was the fact that it was made by a young farm boy from Kansas with no formal training in astronomy. Clyde Tombaugh, born in Illinois in 1906, would go on to make one of the most significant astronomical discoveries of the 20th century.\n\nTombaugh's journey into the world of astronomy began as a teenager when he became fascinated by the night sky, observing celestial bodies through his uncle's telescope. His passion for astronomy led him to build his own telescopes, and by the time he was 20, he had already constructed his third backyard telescope.\n\nIn 1928, Tombaugh caught the attention of Vesto M. Slipher, the director of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Slipher offered Tombaugh a job to search for \"Planet X,\" a hypothetical planet beyond Neptune that had been predicted by Percival Lowell, the founder of the observatory.\n\nLowell, a businessman and astronomer, had spent years searching for evidence of intelligent life on Mars before turning his attention to the hunt for a new planet in our solar system. He had noticed anomalies in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus, leading him to believe that there must be another planet with a mass comparable to Neptune's orbiting the sun.\n\nAfter Lowell's death in 1916, the search for Planet X was put on hold due to a legal battle with Lowell's widow. It wasn't until 1927 that the Lowell Observatory was able to resume the search, with Tombaugh taking on the task using a new 13-inch refracting telescope.\n\nTombaugh's methodical approach to the search involved taking pairs of photographic plates of the night sky, carefully comparing them to detect any objects that had moved between exposures. Using a blinking comparator device, Tombaugh meticulously scanned the plates, looking for any signs of a planet beyond Neptune.\n\nAfter months of tireless work and countless cold nights in the observatory dome, Tombaugh's dedication paid off. In March 1930, he discovered Pluto, a small icy world orbiting the sun in the distant reaches of our solar system.\n\nThe announcement of Pluto's discovery was met with excitement and wonder by both the scientific community and the public. Tombaugh's remarkable achievement not only added a new member to our solar system but also inspired generations of aspiring astronomers to look up at the night sky and dream of new discoveries waiting to be made.\n\nClyde Tombaugh's story is a testament to the power of curiosity, dedication, and perseverance in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. His humble beginnings as a farm boy from Kansas did not deter him from reaching for the stars and making a lasting impact on our understanding of the universe.",

It's not a contentious process, though - some are the names the New Horizons team has been using since the beginning, others are suggestions made by members of the public.\"We're very excited to approve names recognising people of significance to Pluto and the pursuit of exploration as well as the mythology of the underworld.

Now, using sensors from 2,000 sites across the US, researchers have what they are claiming is the \"first unambiguous evidence\" of upper atmospheric bow waves in the wake of an eclipse Since the initial proposal in 1970, several attempts have been made to observe these waves. For starters,\n\na 1973 study was inconclusive.Microbarographs were used to observe a 1976 eclipse in Australia, and that study produced findings that were consistent with the eclipse bow wave hypothesis.\n\nThen, data consistent with eclipse bow waves were observed in 1987\n\n- but neither of these events produced conclusive results.In 2011, researchers from Taiwan announced they'd actually observed the waves. They used ground-based GPS satellite receivers to track a 2009 eclipse over Taiwan and Japan, looking for changes in electron content - a higher electron count means a higher level of ionisation as electrons get stripped from atoms, creating plasma.The gravity waves are essentially a higher concentration of plasma in the ionosphere, and can be ascertained by that spike in electron content.\nThe researchers observed both bow and stern waves, wavelengths between 36 and 120 kilometres\n\n(22 and 75 miles), periods of three or five minutes, and travelling through the ionosphere at 100 metres (330 feet) per second.This is the same technique researchers used to track this year's eclipse - but they had a lot more land available across which to track the shadow, a lot more sensors, and therefore a lot more data.They observed the waves as electron changes across central and eastern US, with 300-400 kilometre wavelength, periods of around 25 minutes, and travelling at speeds of 280 metres per second - too quickly to be attributed to known gravity wave disturbances we get due to typical ionospheric processes.The researchers attribute the difference in findings to the limited field of view in a narrow band used by the researchers in the 2011 study.\n\"This study reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon, and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere, and demonstrates persistent coupling processes between different components of the Earth's atmosphere, a topic of significant community interest,\" the researchers wrote in their paper.They added that their results \"present the most comprehensive set of eclipse-induced wave characteristics available to date, advance theoretical understanding, and address a long-standing controversy surrounding one of nature's most spectacular active events",

The study, conducted during the total solar eclipse on 22 July 2009 that swept over Eastern Asia, sheds light on the complex interactions between the Moon's shadow and Earth's atmosphere.\n\nSince the 1970s, scientists have theorized that the Moon's shadow moving across the Earth's atmosphere at supersonic speeds could generate bow waves. These bow waves, akin to the ripples created by a boat moving through water, were predicted to manifest as the Moon's shadow passed over specific regions of the planet.\n\nUsing advanced analysis techniques such as the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), researchers studied the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) derived from ground-based GPS receivers in Taiwan and Japan during the total solar eclipse. What they found surpassed all expectations - not only did they observe the predicted bow wave, but they also identified a stern wave on the equator side of the eclipse path, as well as a stern wake trailing behind the Moon's shadow.\n\nThe bow and stern waves, characterized by acoustic gravity waves with periods of approximately 3 to 5 minutes, were observed traveling equatorward in the ionosphere at speeds of around 100 m/s. These waves represent a unique phenomenon resulting from the interaction between the Moon's shadow and the Earth's upper atmosphere during a total solar eclipse.\n\nThis groundbreaking discovery opens up new avenues for research into the dynamics of Earth's ionosphere and the effects of celestial events on our planet's atmospheric processes. By unraveling the mysteries of these bow and stern waves, scientists hope to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between solar eclipses and Earth's ionosphere, paving the way for further exploration into the hidden forces shaping our planet's atmosphere.",

        "a": "Biology is really one big horror story. You don't need to look much further than the various types of parasites that drive their hosts into the mouths of hungry predators.If you're keeping track of these tiny monsters, you should know that there's a species of flatworm that parks itself inside the eyeball of a fish, and controls when its host hides from birds or exposes itself to be eaten - all to benefit its very complicated (and creepy) life cycle.\nA team led by the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow, Russia found that a common parasite called an eye fluke, Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, evolved this rather gruesome way of navigating its way through its somewhat complex life cycle.The fluke relies on three different animals to develop from egg to adult:It mates in a bird's digestive tract, where the eggs pass into the water with the bird's faeces\nLarvae hatch from the eggs and seek out a freshwater snail to burrow into, where they mature and reproduce asexually\nThe next stage of larvae, free-swimming forms of the parasite called cercariae, leave the snail and then dig their way through a fish's hide for their final journey, which ends in the lens of the animal's eyeball in a stage called metacercariae\nA bird eats the fish, infected eyeballs and all, and the fun begins all over again.\nStudies had shown that the parasite can affect the host's vision, which was suspected to help the fluke by making it harder for the fish to detect predators.Researchers conducting this new study weren't convinced that there was a lot of evidence for this, so in 2015 they set out to study the behaviours of infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by dosing around 25 fish with immature flukes.While the trout usually swam less vigorously, a researcher tasked with catching them with a dip net \u2013 unaware of which fish were infected and which weren't \u2013 found the infected fish a little harder to catch.\nBoth of these behaviours would help the trout avoid being spotted and nabbed by a bird before the flukes had a chance to grow into sexually mature adults.While the host's behaviour clearly changed, it didn't seem to be due to any induced blindness.\"In our study, manipulations of the host behaviour arose when metacercariae were small and host vision impairment due to cataract formation was unlikely,\" they wrote in their 2015 paper.If the parasite was pulling any strings, it was through chemistry rather than simply blocking out the light inside their eyeball.Now, in their most recent study, the team noticed there were in fact two distinct forms of behaviour, most likely differentiated by changes in the maturity of the flukes.Once they'd moved through whatever the fluke equivalent of puberty is, it was game on - the researchers noticed that the trout became more active and moved closer to the surface.\nThey also found that while both infected and non-infected fish would freeze as the silhouette of a bird passed overhead, the infected ones started moving sooner.The evidence suggests that the fish are being manipulated by their tiny hitchhikers to avoid being eaten while young, and then head for the bird's gut when old enough to reproduce sexually.\"Our findings suggest that immature larvae of D. pseudospathaceum induce changes in host behaviour that can protect them from predation,\" the researchers wrote in their 2015 study.They now\n\nadd in this new paper that the more mature \"metacercariae can change rainbow trout's behavior predisposing them to avian predation\".Of course, eye flukes aren't the only nightmare fuel parasites out there.Toxoplasmosis gondii is a well-known single-celled parasite that infects rodents and turns them into suicidal cat-lovers, even long after the parasites have cleared out",

The findings shed light on the intricate relationship between parasitic infections and the ecological dynamics of predator-prey interactions in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe experiments conducted by the research team revealed that three-spined sticklebacks infected with low intensities of eye fluke exhibited compromised vision, leading to difficulties in accurately selecting prey. Furthermore, the infected fish displayed a shortened reactive distance to potential prey, indicating a potential alteration in their hunting strategy.\n\nDr. Smith, the lead researcher of the study, highlighted the implications of these results on the fitness of individual fish within the population. \"Our findings suggest that eye fluke infection not only impairs the visual capabilities of three-spined sticklebacks but also influences their foraging efficiency and ultimately their survival and reproductive success,\" Dr. Smith explained.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores the broader implications for the field of prey selection research. By demonstrating the significant impact of parasitic infections on predator behavior, the research opens up new avenues for investigating the complex interplay between host-parasite interactions and predator-prey dynamics in aquatic environments.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for understanding the ecological consequences of parasitic infections on fish populations and highlight the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects. As the research continues to unravel the intricate connections between parasites, predators, and prey, it offers valuable insights into the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems.\n\nOverall, this study provides a compelling glimpse into the hidden world of parasitic infections and their far-reaching effects on the behavior and ecology of aquatic organisms.

The event, attended by a multitude of physicists, shed light on the promising future of quantum computing technology.\n\nJohn Martinis, a leading figure in Google's quantum computing team, revealed the company's ambitious target of constructing and testing a 49-qubit quantum computer by the end of the year. This cutting-edge computer will utilize qubits composed of superconducting circuits, each meticulously prepared in a precise quantum state based on a two-state system. The successful completion of this test will mark a significant milestone in the advancement of quantum computing technology.\n\nSergio Boixo, a colleague of Martinis at Google, emphasized the immense potential of a quantum computer with around 50 qubits, stating that it would be capable of performing tasks that surpass the capabilities of even the fastest classical computers. Quantum computers are anticipated to revolutionize computational tasks by offering an exponential increase in speed for specific chores such as prime number factorization and exact simulations of organic molecules.\n\nThe key to the superior performance of quantum computers lies in the concept of entanglement, where entangled qubits enable the manipulation of multiple states simultaneously. This unique feature of quantum systems opens up new possibilities for solving complex problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers.\n\nThe collaborative efforts of leading tech companies and academic institutions in the field of quantum computing are propelling the development of this revolutionary technology. With the promise of unprecedented computational power and capabilities, quantum computers are poised to redefine the landscape of computing and scientific research in the near future.",
        "b": "The 4th International Conference on Quantum Technologies held in Moscow last month was supposed to put the spotlight on Google, who were preparing to give a lecture on a 49-qubit quantum computer they have in the works.\nA morning talk presented by Harvard University's Mikhail Lukin, however, upstaged that evening's event with a small announcement of his own \u2013 his team of American and Russian researchers had successfully tested a 51-qubit device, setting a landmark in the race for quantum supremacy.Quantum computers are considered to be part of the next generation in revolutionary technology; devices that make use of the odd 'in-between' states of quantum particles to accelerate the processing power of digital machines.The truth is both fascinating and disappointing. It's unlikely we'll be playing Grand Theft Auto VR8K-3000 on a quantum-souped Playstation 7 any time soon. Sorry, folks.Quantum computing isn't all about swapping one kind of chip for a faster one.What it does do is give us a third kind of bit where typical computers have only two. In quantum computing, we apply quantum superposition \u2013 that odd cloud of 'maybes' that a particle occupies before we observe its existence cemented as one of two different states \u2013 to solving highly complex computational problems.\nWhile those kinds of problems are a long, tedious process that tax even our best supercomputers, a quantum computer's \"qubit\" mix of 1s, 0s, and that extra space in between can make exercises such as simulating quantum systems in molecules or factorising prime numbers vastly easier to crunch.That's not to say quantum computing could never be a useful addition for your home desktop. But to even begin dreaming of the possibilities, there are a whole number of problems to solve first.One of them is to ramp up a measly handful of qubits from less than 20 to something that can begin to rival our best classical supercomputers on those trickier tasks.That number? About 50-odd, a figure that's often referred to in rather rapturous terms as quantum supremacy.The Harvard device was based on an array of super-cooled atoms of rubidium held in a trap of magnets and laser 'tweezers' that were then excited in a fashion that allowed their quantum states to be used as a single system.\nThe researchers were able to control 51 of these trapped atoms in such a way that they could model some pretty complex quantum mechanics, something well out of reach of your everyday desktop computer.While the modelling was mostly used to test the limits of this kind of set-up, the researchers gained useful insights into the quantum dynamics associated with what's called many-body phenomena. Fortunately they were still able to test their relatively simpler discoveries using classical computers, finding their technique was right on the money.The research is currently on the pre-publish website arXiv.com, awaiting peer review. But the announcement certainly has the quantum computing community talking about the possibilities and consequences of achieving such limits.The magical number of 50 qubits is more like a relative horizon than a true landmark. Not much has changed in the world of quantum computing with the Harvard announcement, and we still have a long way to go before this kind of technology will be useful in making any significant discoveries.\nGoogle's own plan for a 49-qubit device uses a completely different process to Lukin's, relying on multiple-qubit quantum chips that employ a solid-state superconducting structure called a Josephson junction.They've proven their technology with a simpler 9-qubit version, and plan to gradually step up to their goal.Without going into detail, each of the technologies has its pros and cons when it comes to scaling and reliability.A significant problem with quantum computing will be how to make the system as reliable and error-free as possible. While classical computing can duplicate processes to reduce the risk of mistakes, the probabilistic nature of qubits makes this impossible for quantum calculations.There's also the question on how to connect a number of units together to form ever larger processors.\nWhich methods will address these concerns best in the long run is anybody's guess. \"There are several platforms that are very promising, and they are all entering the regime where it is getting interesting, you know, system sizes you cannot simulate with classical computers,\" Lukin said to Himanshu Goenka from International Business Times.\"But I think it is way premature to pick a winner among them. Moreover, if we are thinking about truly large scales, hundreds of thousands of qubits, systems which will be needed for some algorithms, to be honest, I don't think anyone knows how to go there.\"It's a small step on the road to a hundred thousand qubits, but it doesn't make passing this milestone any less significant.\n\nHappy 51, Harvar",

For a lot of us, it can be a pretty brutal introduction to adulthood.But more and more experts are beginning to question whether the majority of these surgeries are even necessary. And a growing body of research indicates that we might be putting people through the risk of expensive tooth removal for no reason.To be clear, not all wisdom teeth removals are unnecessary. Wisdom teeth can become infected, cause tooth decay or cysts, damage neighbouring teeth, and cause a huge amount of pain if left in people's jaws.In these cases, the evidence is clear that it's far better for a patient to have these 'third molars' - the official name for wisdom teeth - removed.\nBut it's the other cases that researchers are beginning to question - the cases where wisdom teeth are impacted but are otherwise healthy, or don't have any symptoms at all.The UK gave up on routinely removing wisdom teeth without solid evidence back in 1998, after a study at the University of York concluded that there was no scientific evidence to support it.That same year, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh said that for patients who don't have a condition related to third molars,\n\nremoval is \"not advisable\".Still, in many countries, including the US and Australia, routine wisdom teeth removal remains the standard procedure. The reason given is that leaving them in is simply putting off the inevitable, because patients with wisdom teeth will face infection or complications later on.\nBased on that logic,\n\nin 2011,\n\n10 million wisdom teeth were removed from Americans' mouths, and a 2015 study estimated that seven times more people are hospitalised for the removal of impacted wisdom teeth in Australia than in the UK.\n\nBut new research suggests that it might be overkill.\"Everybody is at risk for appendicitis, but do you take out everyone's appendix?\" Greg J. Huang, chairman of orthodontics at the University of Washington in Seattle\n\ntold Rony Carin Rabin over at\n\nThe New York Times.\"I'm not against removing wisdom teeth, but you should do an assessment and have a good clinical reason.\"So what does the research say? The more recent evidence to support getting wisdom teeth out \"just in case\" comes from a 2014 review that looked at seven papers examining what happened when young adults left their wisdom teeth in. And while, overall, the study showed that leaving wisdom teeth in\n\ndid\n\nlead to an increased risk of complications later on, that wasn't the full story.\n\"The review concluded that the risk of having to undergo removal appeared to increase as subjects aged,\" Rob Wile explains for Fusion.\"But at least one of the studies in the [review] concluded no such thing. Rather,\n\nthe British study\n\nfound that 83.13 percent of patients survived the one-year study period symptom-free, and just 5 percent had to have teeth removed.\"Rabin over at The New York Times also notes that while several studies have linked keeping wisdom teeth in with ongoing problems, \"There does not appear to be a single randomised clinical trial - the gold standard for scientific proof - comparing similar patients who have and have not undergone prophylactic wisdom teeth removal.\"On the other hand, there's\n\na solid and growing body of research showing the opposite - that a lot of wisdom teeth removal is unnecessar",

        "a": "Title: Study Reveals How Mosquitoes Navigate Towards Human Hosts Using Odor Cues\n\nA recent wind-tunnel study has shed light on the fascinating behavior of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in their quest to locate human hosts for a blood meal. The study, conducted by a team of researchers, focused on the upwind flight and source location of these mosquitoes in response to plumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas and odors emanating from human feet.\n\nWhen tested individually, both CO2 and human foot odor were found to attract the mosquitoes, with more than 70% of the insects locating the sources in less than 3 minutes. However, when the two cues were presented simultaneously in choice tests, the results were surprising. The study found that the mosquitoes did not orientate along the CO2 plume but instead navigated towards the source of foot odor, with over 80% successfully locating it.\n\nInterestingly, when a plume of CO2 was presented within a broader plume of human foot odor at a lower concentration, the mosquitoes did not locate the CO2 source. Instead, they exhibited upwind flight behavior towards the diffuse foot odor plume, indicating a strong preference for human odor cues over CO2 when in close proximity to a potential host.\n\nThe findings of this study suggest that while CO2 plays a crucial role in attracting mosquitoes from a distance, once they are in the vicinity of a human host, their orientation and landing are primarily guided by the complex blend of human odors. This indicates a shift in the mosquitoes' behavior, where CO2 becomes less influential in their decision-making process as they zero in on their target.\n\nThese insights into the navigation and host-seeking behavior of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes could have important implications for the development of more effective mosquito control strategies. By understanding how these insects respond to different odor cues, researchers may be able to devise novel approaches to disrupt their ability to locate and feed on human hosts, ultimately helping to reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.",

They'll nest inside your mattress and feast on your flesh at night, and they develop resistance to pesticides really quickly.\nSo once you have them, getting them gone is really tricky and requires professional help.And there has been a resurgence around the world in the last decade, possibly exacerbated by the accessibility of low-cost travel options.Bed bugs, or Cimex lectularius, are small, can't fly, and prefer living in holes in their host's sleeping area, yet infestations are common around the world in travel accommodations.The likeliest explanation is that they're hitchhiking rides in travellers' luggage.There are steps you can take to minimise the risk of that happening to you, according to researchers from the University of Sheffield in the UK.Namely, taking care of your dirty laundry - because it turns out that C. lectularius likes your clothes when they're grubby.To get to that point, first the team thought about mosquitoes, another insect that feeds on the blood of mammals.\nMosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, which is present in mammalian exhalation. However, in the presence of the smell of a human body, the mosquito will preference that over CO2.It's possible that bed bugs have similar instincts, so the team set up two identical, temperature controlled rooms to figure out if that was the case.Containers of 10 bed bugs, 5 male and 5 female, were placed in the rooms.

The study, led by Gallup et al. in 2002, focused on observing the responses of subjects to their reflections in mirrors to determine their level of self-recognition.\n\nThe key test employed in the study involved assessing whether the subjects could use their reflections to identify and respond to a mark placed on their face, head, or other parts of their body. This test, as outlined by Bard et al. in 2006, is considered the definitive measure of self-recognition. The mark is discreetly applied to the subjects while they are distracted or under anesthesia, making it visible only when they view themselves in a mirror.\n\nThe ability to recognize oneself in a mirror and respond to a mark on the body is a significant indicator of self-awareness and cognitive abilities. This study sheds light on the cognitive processes involved in self-recognition and provides valuable insights into the development of self-awareness in animals and children.\n\nThe findings of this research have the potential to enhance our understanding of the complexities of self-perception and consciousness across different species.

        "b": "Self-awareness might seem like the most basic part of life to us humans, but it's a surprisingly rare concept when it comes to other animals. While great apes, dolphins, orcas, rhesus macaques, Eurasian magpies, and a single Asiatic elephant have all passed the self-recognition test, everything from pandas and pigeons to sea lions, gorillas, and several species of monkey have failed to show signs of consciousness.\nDogs were also on that list of failures - until now. Traditionally, self- consciousness is evaluated via the 'mirror test'. If an animal uses its own reflection to examine or touch a red mark that's been applied to its body without its knowledge, scientists can confirm that they possess some sense of self. But what if the animal isn't that visually oriented?\"I believed that because dogs are much less sensitive to visual stimuli with respect to what, for example, humans and many apes are, it is likely that the failure of this and of other species in the mirror test is mainly due to the sensory modality chosen by the investigator to test the self-awareness and not, necessarily, to the absence of this latter,\" says evolutionary biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti from Tomsk State University in Russia.Gatti was prompted into this line of thinking by the fact that in past mirror tests, dogs have shown no interest in looking at their reflection in the mirror, but they will go ahead and sniff the area and possibly even urinate around it. While this got them a big old \"fail\" in previous studies, Gatti thought the behaviour warranted a closer look.\n\nBack in 2001, renowned animal behaviour expert, Marc Bekoff, investigated the 'mirror sniffing' phenomenon via an experiment dubbed the 'yellow snow test'. Yep it's exactly what it sounds like. Over a five-year period, Bekoff took his dog Jethro on walks during the winter months, and timed how long he would sniff clumps of snow soaked in his own or other dogs' urine.\nThe AnimalWise blog explains:\n\"Bekoff would wait until Jethro or other known female and male dogs urinated on snow, and then scoop up the clump of yellow snow as soon as Jethro was elsewhere and did not see him pick it up or move it (Bekoff used clean gloves each time and took other precautions to minimise odour and visual cues).\nBekoff then moved the yellow snow varying distances down the path so that Jethro would run across the displaced urine: (i) within about 10 seconds, (ii) between 10 and 120 seconds later, or (iii) between 120 and 300 seconds later. After Jethro arrived, Bekoff recorded how long he sniffed at the yellow snow, whether he urinated over it using the typical male raised-leg posture, and whether urination immediately followed the sniffing ('scent marking').\"\nNot surprisingly, Jethro paid a lot less attention to his own urine than he did to that of other dogs, so Bekoff concluded that his pet had to have some sense of self to be able to distinguish between scents. But with a sample size of one, the experiment wasn't exactly going to set the scientific community on fire.Gatti decided to come up with something a little more convincing. Called the Sniff Test of Self-Recognition (STSR), the experiment involved collecting urine samples from four stray dogs and systematically exposing them to the scents. He repeated this four times a year at the beginning of every season.\n\"I placed within a fence five urine samples containing the scent of each of the four dogs and a 'blank sample', filled only with cotton wool odourless,\" he says. \"The containers were then opened and each dog was individually introduced to the inside of the cage and allowed to freely move for 5 minutes. The time taken by each dog to sniff each sample was recorded.\"Just like Jethro, each dog spent way more time smelling the urine samples of other dogs than their own, which supports the hypothesis that they know their own scent and aren't that interested in it. The result was stronger the older the dog, which suggests that self-awareness develops with age.\n\nIt might seem obvious that dogs would know their own scent, but if you've ever seen a dog bark at its own reflection, or completely ignore it - totally unaware of its own appearance and movements - you can see the significance.\"I demonstrated that even when applying it to multiple individuals living in groups and with different ages and sexes, this test provides significant evidence of self-awareness in dogs and can play a crucial role in showing that this capacity is not a specific feature of only great apes, humans, and a few other animals, but it depends on the way in which researchers try to verify it,\" says Gatti.\nThe findings are published in the journal Ethology, Ecology and Evolution.Now, I know what you're thinking: that sample size of four is pretty crap. And yep, it is, so we can't really call this an official \"pass\" just yet. But the fact that we may well need to rethink the mirror test and figure out how to better align it with how certain species see the world is certainly worthy of a proper investigation. Certain behaviours such as empathy have been linked to self-awareness, and thanks to the 'yawn test', there's evidence that dogs feel empathy towards their owners.We'll just have to wait and see if scientists are prepared to conduct a giant yellow snow test to put this conundrum to bed once and for al",

But since 2012, efficiencies have dramatically improved. \n\nAccording to an editorial in Nature Materials, \"the exceptional performance of hybrid perovskite materials may revolutionise the field of renewable energy with cheap solar cells having power-conversion efficiencies comparable to those of silicon photovoltaic devices\".\n\nNot only are the materials being investigated by researchers more abundant and more affordable than silicon, they are also very good at absorbing light.\n\nAccording to an article from MIT Technology Review written in August 2013, \"while conventional silicon solar panels use materials that are about 180 micrometers thick, the new solar cells use less than one micrometer of material to capture the same amount of sunlight. Furthermore, the pigment is a semiconductor that can effectively transport the electric charge created when light hits it\".\nThe materials are also relatively easy to incorporate into working devices: the pigment can be spread on a sheet of glass, and covered with several layers of other materials that enable the movement of electrons through the cell - sort of like a sandwich.IEEE's Spectrum points out, however, that two main barriers have impeded \"rapid progress\" for perovskite solar cells.\n\nThe first issue is that the cells' power conversion efficiency often varies depending on how it is measured.\n\nThis performance variability - known as hysteresis\n\n-\n\nwas highlighted in the afortementioned Nature Materials editorial, which raised concerns about the validity of efficiency values being reported.\n\nSecondly, researchers have been working on extending the range of the light wavelengths that perovskite cells can trap, and convert to electricity. Doing so is necessary to achieve efficiencies comparable to silicon cells",

However, a peculiar phenomenon known as hysteresis in the current-voltage curves of these solar cells has presented a challenge in fully realizing their potential.\n\nIn a recent study published in a leading scientific journal, researchers have delved into the origins of this anomalous hysteresis and its impact on the performance of perovskite solar cells. The study highlights that while the efficiency of these solar cells continues to rise, understanding and addressing the hysteresis is crucial for further advancements in their performance.\n\nThe researchers identified several factors that influence the extent of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells, shedding light on how this phenomenon can be mitigated or exacerbated. By demonstrating stabilized power output under working conditions, the study suggests that presenting this parameter alongside traditional power conversion efficiency metrics could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the solar cells' performance.\n\nThe study hypothesizes three possible origins of the hysteresis effect, sparking discussions on its implications for device efficiency and future research directions in the field of perovskite solar cells. Resolving the mystery of hysteresis is deemed essential for unlocking the full potential of these solar cells and achieving a significant leap in their performance.\n\nAs researchers continue to unravel the complexities of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells, the findings from this study offer valuable insights that could pave the way for further advancements in the development of these next-generation photovoltaic technologies. By addressing this challenge, scientists aim to propel perovskite solar cells towards even higher efficiencies and broader applications in the renewable energy sector.",

It's complicated, but some 30 years of psychological research suggest there might just be a few methods that are worth a try.Use a person's body against themGot a date coming up? Maybe you should consider taking them to see a horror movie. \"Misattribution of arousal\" is a popular theory in social psychology that suggests people sometimes mislabel feelings from their body.For example, you experience an elevated heart rate when you are anxious, but also when you are excited.Psychologists have therefore been experimenting on whether it is possible to use this idea to manipulate individuals into thinking they are experiencing particular emotions, such as believing they are attracted when they're actually scared This is because removing the \"you\" removes the accusatory element.Another linguistic trick is to use nouns rather than verbs when discussing an outcome you want to happen.In one study people were asked \"how important is it to you to be a voter in tomorrow's election?\" versus \"how important is it to you to vote in tomorrow's election?\" When people were asked about \"being a voter\", this primed their self-identity as a person who votes.The people who were asked about being a \"voter\" were 11 percent more likely to vote in a state election the next day, compared to those who were asked about \"voting\".There are also various other body and language tricks you can employ that have been shown to increase people's liking or trust in you, such as subtly mimicking people's body posture, looking people in the eye more frequently and saying their name more often Use rewards and punishments variablyDoes your loved one need some \"behaviour shaping\"? Maybe a bit more hanging up the bathmat, and a bit less using your toothbrush?We all know that you can increase the likelihood that someone will do something by rewarding it, and decrease it through punishment.But, operant conditioning psychology shows that for prolonged manipulation, it is better not to reward or punish every instance of the behaviour.So if you want someone to keep doing something (or to stop doing something), you can simply alter the schedule by which you dole out rewards or punishments to maximise their compliance.A variable reinforcement schedule like this works by the slightly creepy \"will they, won't they\" principle \u2013 where the uncertainty makes people learn faster and maintain a behaviour longer once the reward or punishment is removed.In the same way, not knowing how many more plays you need before you win is part of what makes gambling and the lottery so addictive.Ask for something you don't wantA large body of popular research suggests that if you are trying to get something, you may help your case by also asking for something you don't want.The \"foot-in-the-door method\" refers to the fact that, once a person has agreed to a very small request, they are more likely to agree to another, much larger request \u2013 significantly more so than if they were only posed with the large request.It was first suggested this must occur because people use their own behaviour as a cue to their internal attitudes.Since they were not pressured externally into agreeing, the person unconsciously infers their acquiescence is due to a positive attitude towards the asker or the issue.The effect seems to hold even when the second request is a completely different type, or when made by a different person.Given this, it was thought that perhaps the first \"yes\" changes the individual's own disposition towards saying yes to things in general (\"I am clearly such a yes man\").On the flip side, if you ask for something outrageously large that a person would never agree to, you actually raise your chances of agreement to a second smaller request.This may also be a form of reciprocity effect: the person being asked is compelled to make a compromise, in response to the asker making a concession.In sum, social psychology may not change your life \u2026 but it may just help you get the last biscuit.Harriet Dempsey-Jones, Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Neurosciences, University of Oxford.This article was originally published by\n\nThe Conversation.

The study, which involved sending approximately 10,000 solicitation letters to potential donors, revealed compelling insights into the role of gifts in charitable giving.\n\nThe experiment, which included three different conditions, aimed to explore the impact of gifts on donation behavior. One-third of the letters contained no gift, another third contained a small gift, and the remaining third contained a large gift. The assignment of these treatments was done randomly to ensure the validity of the results.\n\nThe findings of the study demonstrated a clear correlation between the inclusion of gifts in solicitation letters and the frequency of donations. Compared to the group that received no gift, the relative frequency of donations increased by 17 percent when a small gift was included and by a substantial 75 percent when a large gift was included.\n\nThis research not only sheds light on the economic importance of gift exchange in charitable giving but also extends the current understanding of this phenomenon. While previous studies on gift exchange have primarily been confined to laboratory settings, this field experiment provides valuable real-world data that further enriches the existing body of research in this area.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant for charitable organizations seeking to optimize their fundraising strategies. By leveraging the power of gift exchange, nonprofits may be able to enhance donor engagement and ultimately increase donation rates.\n\nAs the study pioneers a new approach to investigating gift exchange in a natural setting, it opens up avenues for future research and underscores the potential of incorporating gifts into fundraising efforts to drive positive outcomes in the realm of charitable giving.",

        "a": "Title: Study Reveals Role of Atmospheric CO2 in Pliocene Glaciations\n\nA recent study has shed light on the factors contributing to the onset of intensive glaciations on Greenland, Scandinavia, and North America during the Pliocene epoch between 3.6 and 2.7 million years ago. The study, conducted by a team of researchers, suggests that a decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels may have played a significant role in triggering these glaciations, alongside other tectonic and oceanic events occurring during the same period.\n\nThe researchers presented detailed atmospheric CO2 estimates derived from boron isotopes in planktic foraminifer shells spanning the period from 4.6 to 2.0 million years ago. The study revealed that maximal Pliocene atmospheric CO2 estimates gradually declined from around 410 \u03bcatm to early Pleistocene values of 300 \u03bcatm at 2.0 Ma. Even after the onset of large-scale ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere, maximal pCO2 estimates remained higher than values characteristic of early Pleistocene interglacials.\n\nOn the other hand, minimal atmospheric CO2 levels during the Pliocene also showed a gradual decrease from 310 to 245 \u03bcatm at 3.2 Ma, coinciding with the start of transient glaciations on Greenland. The study found that values characteristic of early Pleistocene glacial atmospheric CO2 of 200 \u03bcatm were abruptly reached after 2.7 Ma during the late Pliocene transition.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the trend observed in atmospheric CO2 levels is consistent with the idea that ocean stratification and iron fertilization increased after 2.7 Ma in the North Pacific and Southern Ocean. This may have led to increased glacial CO2 storage in the oceanic abyss after 2.7 Ma onwards, contributing to the onset of glaciations during the Pliocene epoch.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay of atmospheric CO2 levels, tectonic events, and oceanic processes during the Pliocene epoch, offering a better understanding of the factors driving climate change and glaciation events in Earth's history. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when studying past climate changes and their implications for the future.",
        "b": "According to the latest figures, levels of atmospheric carbon have officially surpassed 400 parts per million (ppm), and there's little hope of returning them to safe levels - the situation is now permanent.\nWhat's the big deal about 400 ppm? Well, the 'safe' level of CO2 in the atmosphere is considered to be 350 ppm, and the last time Earth experienced levels that were consistently this high was roughly 4 million years ago. That means humans have literally never experienced CO2 like this before.According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the CO2 value for September 2016 will definitely be above 400 ppm, and will likely be around 401 ppm. And here's the thing - September typically has the lowest atmospheric CO2 levels of the year.\"Is it possible that October 2016 will yield a lower monthly value than September and dip below 400 ppm? Almost impossible,\" Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Program, writes in a blog post.Keeling says that by November this year, we could be pushing towards new highs, and perhaps even breaking the 410 ppm barrier.\n\"[I]t already seems safe to conclude that we won't be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year - or ever again for the indefinite future,\" he adds.Even if, by some miracle, we all stopped emitting carbon dioxide tomorrow, it would take decades to get us back below the 400 ppm threshold - and we all know that's never going to happen.\"At best (in that scenario), one might expect a balance in the near term, and so CO2 levels probably wouldn't change much - but would start to fall off in a decade or so,\" Gavin Schmidt, NASA's chief climate scientist, told Brian Kahn at Climate Central.\n\n\"In my opinion, we won't ever see a month below 400 ppm.\"For years now, scientists have been predicting that we'd hit the 400 ppm threshold and eventually tip over. Back in 2013, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii - described as the world's \"gold standard\" carbon dioxide observatory - hit the 400 ppm mark, and gradually, all other observing stations followed suit.\nIn May 2016, the world collectively passed the 400 ppm threshold, with the South Pole Observatory in Antarctica being the last to clear 400 ppm.\n\nAnd this September, which should have been our low point for the year, failed to deliver, and now we're stuck with this mess until we can figure out how to significantly decrease our emissions.So when was the last time the planet had CO2 levels like this? Analysis of carbon levels in ice cores can give us indications of atmospheric CO2 as far back as 800,000 years ago, and scientists have estimated that it's \"inconceivable\" that they would have been much above 300 ppm at that time.According to\n\nDavid Etheridge, principal research scientist at Australia's CSIRO,\n\nanalysis of sea sediments can push our estimates of historic CO2 levels back to about 2 million years ago. Based on these values, scientists have created climate models that give us an idea of what conditions on Earth were like tens of millions of years ago.\nAs\n\nGraham Readfearn reported for The Guardian earlier this year, a 2009 study in Science found the last time in Earth's history that atmospheric CO2 levels were this high for a sustained period was between 15 and 20 million years ago.\n\nMore recently,\n\na 2011 study in Paleoceanography found that atmospheric CO2 levels could have been comparable to today's levels much later than that - between 2 and 4.6 million years ago.Regardless of whether Earth has experienced these levels 15 or 4 million years ago, humans have never been around to experience them until now. And that means there's really no telling what's going to happen next.With July and August being the two hottest months on record EVER, let's hope Elon Musk's plans for Mars domination\n\ncan give humanity a Plan B soon",

Now a small study by UK researchers has found that they're the direct result of polluted air.\"This is a discovery finding, and now what should start is a whole new examination of this as a potentially very important environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease,\" one of the team, Barbara Maher from Lancaster University, told Damian Carrington at The Guardian.\"Now there is a reason to go on and do the epidemiology and the toxicity testing, because these particles are so prolific and people are exposed to them.\"Maher and her team examined brain tissue from 37 people in Manchester, England, and Mexico City, aged between 3 years old and 92. Each of them contained particles of a type of iron oxide called magnetite, and not just traces of them - they were abundant.\n\"You are talking about millions of magnetite particles per gram of freeze-dried brain tissue - it is extraordinary,\" says Maher.The next step was to figure out where these particles were coming from. When the team looked at the particles in the front regions of the brains of six of the volunteers, they found two types of magnetite in the tissue - round particles of magnetite and angular magnetite crystals, and the round ones outnumbered the crystals by about 100 to one.\"Crystal forms are more likely to have a natural source - such as iron that has come out of the body's cells,\" Clare Wilson explains for New Scientist. \"But round particles normally come from melting iron at high temperatures, which happens when fuel is burned.\"A couple of caveats here - the evidence is circumstantial, and the only way to really prove that these particles are sourced from air pollution is to actually trace them all the way from the atmosphere to the brain tissue.\nBut Maher says they also found particles of metals such as platinum that are very rarely found naturally in the body, but are found in many car engines.\n\nThe second big limitation here is that the sample size is tiny, and while the result of abundant round magnetite particles was found in 100 percent of the participants, it's far too early to extrapolate meaning from that for the wider population.But if larger studies do end up finding similar results in a wider, more diverse group of participants, what are the implications?\"Magnetite in the brain is not something you want to have, because it is particularly toxic there,\" Maher told The Guardian, adding that they can produce reactive oxygen molecules called free radicals, which have been linked to ageing and neurological disease.\"Oxidative cell damage is one of the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease, and this is why the presence of magnetite is so potentially significant, because it is so bioreactive,\" she says.\nPrevious research looking at cells grown in the lab has found that iron oxide could be present in the amyloid plaques that have been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease, and a study from earlier in the year also linked the presence of magnetite to damage in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.\n\nWe're still very much in the early stages of figuring out what's going on here, but even if the Alzheimer's evidence is yet to be confirmed, what we do know is that air pollution is seriously bad for all of us.As a study from 2015 found, air pollution is likely contributing to the premature deaths of some 3.3 million people around the world every year, and that figure could double by 2050, so whatever pollution is doing to us, one thing's for sure - it's nothing good.Maher and her team's research has been published in\n\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences",

These nanoparticles, which are distinct from endogenously formed particles, exhibit rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures, indicating a formation process involving cooling from an initially heated iron-bearing source material.\n\nOf particular concern is the size of these magnetite particles, with many being less than 200 nm in diameter. This small size allows them to enter the brain directly through the olfactory nerve, potentially crossing the damaged olfactory unit. The ability of nanoscale magnetite to respond to external magnetic fields and its known toxicity to the brain, including the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), raise alarms about the possible health implications of exposure to airborne particulate matter containing magnetite nanoparticles.\n\nThe study underscores the link between enhanced ROS production and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that exposure to airborne magnetite nanoparticles could pose a significant risk to human health. The findings emphasize the need for further research to investigate the potential hazards associated with exposure to these nanoparticles and to develop strategies to mitigate their impact on brain health.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of magnetite nanoparticles in the human brain, originating from external sources such as urban airborne pollution, highlights a pressing public health concern.

        "a": "Researchers have uncovered what they say is a new class of ultra-low-density ice, which crystallises amid extreme negative pressure on water molecules.While many of us are only familiar with the kind of frozen water that keeps our drinks nice and chilled, regular ice on Earth is just one of around 20 known phases of ice \u2013 and the new forms discovered by researchers in Japan appear to have the lowest density of all known ice crystals.\nThe new ice is called aeroice, and its discovery by researchers at Okayama University is part of an emerging wave of research into how water freezes.A lot of previous studies have seen huge amounts of pressure applied to water molecules to create kinds of ultra-dense ice that don't naturally occur on Earth under ordinary atmospheric conditions, but here the team was focussed on the opposite cause and effect \u2013 the absence of pressure to make ice that isn't dense.\"Our research, which surveys an entire negative-pressure region for the first time, provides a significant stepping stone in exploring this vast and intricate territory on the phase diagram,\" says lead researcher Masakazu Matsumoto.As it stands, there are 17 recognised solid crystalline phases of water that can form all different kinds of ice. Of these, only two occur naturally on Earth, hexagonal ice and cubic ice.\nIt's the former, known as Ice Ih, that makes up almost all the ice on our planet, but another type called Ice Ic can form in Earth's upper atmosphere.All the other kinds of ice phases are what happens when water molecules are frozen in extreme conditions \u2013 often involving severe variations in pressure to replicate how ice might form in exotic or far-flung environments, such as when icy planetary bodies collide in space.Anyway, of the 17 known ice phases \u2013 which are named in order of their discovery \u2013 only two have lower density than normal ice. These are the latest additions to the lineup, called Ice XVI and Ice XVII.Ice XVI was discovered in 2014 by researchers who found ice could form in a kind of 3D crystalline cage called a zeolite structure.In the right conditions, this frozen cage could take shape around a guest molecule \u2013 in this case, neon atoms \u2013 which could then be extracted from the structure, resulting in what became the lowest density phase of ice yet discovered.Masakazu MatsumotoAbove, you can see an example of zeolitic ice on the left, with the molecular structure of one of the types of aeroice on the right.\nNot to be outdone by Ice XVI, simulations by another team of researchers surpassed the milestone in 2016 with Ice XVII, using a similar molecule trapping-and-extracting technique, that theoretically results in ice with 25 percent less density than Ice XVI.The new discovery by Matsumoto's team, aeroice, again stems from molecular rearrangements conducted at negative pressure, but this time involving silica (aka silicon dioxide, SiO2).In simulations, the team removed the two oxygen atoms from SiO2 molecular structure and then swapped out each molecule's single silicon atom for a single oxygen atom, before adding hydrogen atoms.The end result produces a kind of ice with a density about half that of liquid water (~0.5 g/cm3), but despite that extreme low-density, the researchers say aeroices are more stable than any other kinds of zeolite ice that have been engineered to date.\nAdditional simulations suggest aeroices could become even less dense \u2013 between 0 and 0.5 grams per cubic centimetre \u2013 with additional tampering.By adding polyhedral building blocks (structures with six planes or more), the molecules could maintain their crystalline stability while making the overall structure sparser, which would lower the density \u2013 meaning any number of aeroices could ultimately be possible.\"Ices with lower density than normal ice are also found to be manifold,\" says Matsumoto.\"These new structures are the aeroices, and they can be more stable than any zeolitic ice at certain thermodynamic conditions under negative pressure.\"While the findings may be largely of academic interest right now, the potential applications of discoveries like this are huge, ranging from understanding how water behaves in nanotubes and nanopores, to discovering how ice might behave for off-world colonists exploring the far reaches of the Solar System.That's a lot to think about, sure, and it'd probably go down better with a cool beverage in your hand.The findings are reported in The Journal of Chemical Physics",

This discovery challenges existing notions about the nature of ice structures and opens up new possibilities for understanding the properties of water in unconventional forms.\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings of the study is the proposal of \"aeroices,\" even less dense structures than the zeolitic ice phase.
