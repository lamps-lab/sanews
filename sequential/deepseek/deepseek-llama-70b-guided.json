    "output": "Okay, so I need to determine whether the given article is written by a human or generated by AI. Let me read through the article carefully and analyze its characteristics.\n\nFirst, the article starts with a statement about the universe expanding faster than expected, mentioning dark radiation. It then goes into some details about the research findings, including percentages of expansion rates and possible implications like the universe ripping apart. There's a quote from an Australian researcher, Brad Tucker, which adds a personal touch. \n\nThe article continues by explaining the composition of the universe\u2014stars, planets, gas making up only 5%, with the rest being dark matter and dark energy. It mentions specific researchers, like Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, and institutions involved. The methods used, such as observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, Cepheid stars, and Type Ia supernovae, are detailed. \n\nThe Hubble constant value is given as 73.2 km/s/Mpc, and the time it would take for cosmic distances to double is mentioned. The article then discusses various theories, including phantom dark energy, dark radiation, and the possibility of dark matter having unexpected characteristics or Einstein's theory of gravity being incomplete.\n\nNow, considering the characteristics of human-written vs. AI-generated content. Human-written articles tend to have a more conversational and narrative tone, with personal quotes and a flow that tells a story. They often include specific details, names, and institutions, which adds credibility and a personal touch.\n\nAI-generated content, on the other hand, is usually more analytical and factual. It might present information in a straightforward manner without the same level of narrative flow. Sometimes, AI can \"hallucinate\" information, meaning it might include details that aren't entirely accurate or are based on patterns rather than actual data.\n\nLooking at the article, it includes direct quotes from researchers, specific names, and detailed methodologies. The structure is clear and informative, presenting the information in a logical sequence. There's a balance between explaining the science and providing context, which is typical of human writing. The inclusion of specific measurements and the mention of publication in The Astrophysical Journal adds to the credibility, which is something a human writer would include to support the research's validity.\n\nI don't notice any obvious hallucinations or inaccuracies in the information presented. The language is precise and technical in parts but still maintains a readable flow. The use of quotes and specific researcher names suggests a human touch, as AI might not always include such personal elements unless trained on similar data.\n\nTherefore, considering"
