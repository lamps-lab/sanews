Bat-catching spiders have been reported from virtually every continent with the exception of Antarctica (∼90% of the incidences occurring in the warmer areas of the globe between latitude 30° N and 30° S). Most reports refer to the Neotropics (42% of observed incidences)  Asia (28.8%)  and Australia-Papua New Guinea (13.5%). Bat-catching spiders belong to the mygalomorph family Theraphosidae and the araneomorph families Nephilidae  Araneidae  and Sparassidae. In addition to this  an attack attempt by a large araneomorph hunting spider of the family Pisauridae on an immature bat was witnessed. Eighty-eight percent of the reported incidences of bat catches were attributable to web-building spiders and 12% to hunting spiders. Large tropical orb-weavers of the genera Nephila and Eriophora in particular have been observed catching bats in their huge  strong orb-webs (of up to 1.5 m diameter). The majority of identifiable captured bats were small aerial insectivorous bats  belonging to the families Vespertilionidae (64%) and Emballonuridae (22%) and usually being among the most common bat species in their respective geographic area. While in some instances bats entangled in spider webs may have died of exhaustion  starvation  dehydration  and/or hyperthermia (i.e.  non-predation death)  there were numerous other instances where spiders were seen actively attacking  killing  and eating the captured bats (i.e.  predation). This evidence suggests that spider predation on flying vertebrates is more widespread than previously assumed."

The women responded to a second food frequency questionnaire in 1997.Main outcome measure Multivariable survival models were applied to determine the association between milk consumption and time to mortality or fracture.Results During a mean follow-up of 20.1 years  15 541 women died and 17 252 had a fracture  of whom 4259 had a hip fracture. In the male cohort with a mean follow-up of 11.2 years  10 112 men died and 5066 had a fracture  with 1166 hip fracture cases. In women the adjusted mortality hazard ratio for three or more glasses of milk a day compared with less than one glass a day was 1.93 (95% confidence interval 1.80 to 2.06). For every glass of milk  the adjusted hazard ratio of all cause mortality was 1.15 (1.13 to 1.17) in women and 1.03 (1.01 to 1.04) in men. For every glass of milk in women no reduction was observed in fracture risk with higher milk consumption for any fracture (1.02  1.00 to 1.04) or for hip fracture (1.09  1.05 to 1.13). The corresponding adjusted hazard ratios in men were 1.01 (0.99 to 1.03) and 1.03 (0.99 to 1.07). In subsamples of two additional cohorts  one in males and one in females  a positive association was seen between milk intake and both urine 8-iso-PGF2α (a biomarker of oxidative stress) and serum interleukin 6 (a main inflammatory biomarker).Conclusions High milk intake was associated with higher mortality in one cohort of women and in another cohort of men  and with higher fracture incidence in women. Given the observational study designs with the inherent possibility of residual confounding and reverse causation phenomena  a cautious interpretation of the results is recommended."

Few randomized controlled trials give the effect of diet or nutrients on major health outcomes. Dietary guidelines or recommendations tend to be based on observations from prospective cohort studies  possibly describing the eating habits of people who happen to live longer for a multitude of reasons rather than the effects of a particular diet or nutrient. Dietary guidelines may also be designed to provide recommended intakes of specific nutrients  sometimes based on the lowest level of evidence (that is  opinion) and reflecting the assumption that normal intakes in Europe or North America represent those that are optimal.1 As such  it is hardly surprising that dietary guidelines are not always confirmed by experimental evidence from trials  such as the harmful effects of saturated fats2 or the benefits of calcium.3 In a linked paper (doi:10.1136/bmj.g6015) 4 Michaëlsson and colleagues question the role of milk  an item that often features in dietary guidelines.5 Based on observational evidence  Michaëlsson and colleagues raise the possibility that milk could increase the risk "

The aim of this study is to reconstruct diverse diet  social stratification  and migration of the inhabitants of Roman Ephesus and the distinct group of gladiators. Stable carbon  nitrogen  and sulphur isotope analysis were applied  and inorganic bone elements (strontium  calcium) were determined. In total  53 individuals  including 22 gladiators  were analysed. All individuals consumed C3 plants like wheat and barley as staple food. A few individuals show indication of consumption of C4 plants. The δ13C values of one female from the gladiator cemetery and one gladiator differ from all other individuals. Their δ34S values indicate that they probably migrated from another geographical region or consumed different foods. The δ15N values are relatively low in comparison to other sites from Roman times. A probable cause for the depletion of 15N in Ephesus could be the frequent consumption of legumes. The Sr/Ca-ratios of the gladiators were significantly higher than the values of the contemporary Roman inhabitants. Since the Sr/Ca-ratio reflects the main Ca-supplier in the diet  the elevated values of the gladiators might suggest a frequent use of a plant ash beverage  as mentioned in ancient texts."

Here  we used multiprocess phenotypic profiling  combining high-resolution 3D confocal microscopy and multiparametric image analysis  to simultaneously survey the fission yeast genome with respect to three key cellular processes: cell shape  microtubule organization  and cell-cycle progression. We identify  validate  and functionally annotate 262 genes controlling specific aspects of those processes. Of these  62% had not been linked to these processes before and 35% are implicated in multiple processes. Importantly  we identify a conserved role for DNA-damage responses in controlling microtubule stability. In addition  we investigate how the processes are functionally linked. We show unexpectedly that disruption of cell-cycle progression does not necessarily affect cell size control and that distinct aspects of cell shape regulate microtubules and vice versa  identifying important systems-level links across these processes."

Participants (n = 153) belonging to one of four groups (monolingual musician  bilingual musician  bilingual non-musician  or monolingual non-musician) were matched on age and socioeconomic status and administered task switching and dual-task paradigms. Results demonstrated reduced global and local switch costs in musicians compared with non-musicians  suggesting that musical training can contribute to increased efficiency in the ability to shift flexibly between mental sets. On dual-task performance  musicians also outperformed non-musicians. There was neither a cognitive advantage for bilinguals relative to monolinguals  nor an interaction between music and language to suggest additive effects of both types of experience. These findings demonstrate that long-term musical training is associated with improvements in task switching and dual-task performance."

While it is well understood that more frequent and intense climate events in many areas are resulting in a decline in crop yields  the impact on crop quality is less acknowledged  yet it is critical for food systems that benefit both farmers and consumers through high-quality products. This study examines tea (Camellia sinensis; Theaceae)  the world's most widely consumed beverage after water  as a study system to measure effects of seasonal precipitation variability on crop functional quality and associated farmer knowledge  preferences  and livelihoods. Sampling was conducted in a major tea producing area of China during an extreme drought through the onset of the East Asian Monsoon in order to capture effects of extreme climate events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change. Compared to the spring drought  tea growth during the monsoon period was up to 50% higher. Concurrently  concentrations of catechin and methylxanthine secondary metabolites  major compounds that determine tea functional quality  were up to 50% lower during the monsoon while total phenolic concentrations and antioxidant activity increased. The inverse relationship between tea growth and concentrations of individual secondary metabolites suggests a dilution effect of precipitation on tea quality. The decrease in concentrations of tea secondary metabolites was accompanied by reduced farmer preference on the basis of sensory characteristics as well as a decline of up to 50% in household income from tea sales. Farmer surveys indicate a high degree of agreement regarding climate patterns and the effects of precipitation on tea yields and quality. Extrapolating findings from this seasonal study to long-term climate scenario projections suggests that farmers and consumers face variable implications with forecasted precipitation scenarios and calls for research on management practices to facilitate climate adaptation for sustainable crop production."

Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  and gamma-glutamyl transaminase (GGT) were measured. We examined the relationship between coffee intake and enzymatic levels using weighted multiple variable logistic (abnormally elevated levels of enzymes) and linear regression (continuous enzymatic levels). Total coffee consumption was inversely associated with abnormal levels of all four liver enzymes and continuous levels of AST  ALP  and GGT.

Different weight ratios of Al2O3/CSC (Al2O3:CSC = 1:1  2:1  and 3:1) were fabricated  and the corresponding As(V) removal performance revealed that the synthesized 2Al2O3/CSC (mass ratio) possessed the best separation property and the highest adsorption capacity. A natural groundwater sample collected from Togtoh county  Inner Mongolia (China)  with an initial concentration of 233 μg/L As(V) was applied to test the 2Al2O3/CSC application in actual groundwater purification. After processing with 2Al2O3/CSC  the As(V) concentration was reduced to 8.0 μg/L  which met the quality standard of World Health Organization (WHO). A regeneration test indicated that the 2Al2O3/CSC could be reused for at least six times without significant decrease in the adsorption capacity. The as-synthesized 2Al2O3/CSC with the maximum removal capacity of 96.9 mg/g for As(V) would be a promising material for the efficient removal of As(V) from groundwater with high As(V) concentrations in actual applications."

But in places that lack the equipment or technical know-how required to remove it  it still laces drinking water and makes people sick. To tackle this problem  scientists have come up with a new low-cost  simple way to remove arsenic using leftovers from another known health threat — cigarettes. They report their method in ACS' journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research. Jiaxing Li and colleagues explain that naturally occurring and industry-related arsenic contaminates groundwater at high levels in many countries  including Chile  China  Hungary and Mexico. The odorless  tasteless element can cause skin discoloration  stomach pain  partial paralysis and a range of other serious health problems. While the technology for removing arsenic from water exists and is in widespread use in industrialized areas  it is expensive and impractical for rural and developing regions. Scientists have been exploring the use of natural waste materials such as banana peels and rice hulls for removing arsenic from water  but these so far have shown limited efficiency. Recognizing that the porous structure of cigarette ash could be better suited to this purpose  Li's team decided to test it. In a simple  inexpensive  one-step method  the researchers prepared cigarette ash with a coating of aluminum oxide. When they tested the material with contaminated ground water  they found it removed more than 96 percent of the arsenic  reducing its levels to below the standard set by the World Health Organization. Because cigarette ashes are discarded in countries around the world and can be easily collected in places where public smoking is allowed  it could be part of a low-cost solution for a serious public health issue  they say."

This study investigated the effects of three different pretreatments (grinding plus blanching; only grinding; only blanching) for cranberry juice processing on the concentrations of anthocyanins  flavonols  and procyanidins throughout processing. Flavonols and procyanidins were retained in the juice to a greater extent than anthocyanins  and pressing resulted in the most significant losses in polyphenolics due to removal of the seeds and skins. Flavonol aglycones were formed during processing as a result of heat treatment. Drying of cranberry pomace resulted in increased extraction of flavonols and procyanidin oligomers but lower extraction of polymeric procyanidins. The results indicate that cranberry polyphenolics are relatively stable during processing compared to other berries; however  more work is needed to determine their fate during storage of juices."

We analyzed urine samples from 16 California residents in 2011 for 6 chlorinated and nonchlorinated dialkyl or diaryl phosphates (DAPs)  the expected major metabolites of the most prominent PFRs  and qualitatively screened for 18 other metabolites predicted from in vitro studies.

As far as we know  this is the first study to measure these 6 DAP metabolites simultaneously and to detect other PFR metabolites in US urine samples.

We investigated two HIV-infected patients with no HIV-related disease and no detection with routine tests of plasma HIV RNA or cell-associated HIV DNA. We used Sanger and deep sequencing to retrieve HIV DNA sequences integrated in the human genome and tested the host humoral and cellular immune responses. We noticed that viruses from both patients were inactivated by the high prevalence of the transformation of tryptophan codons into stop codons (25% overall (3–100% per gene) and 24% overall (0–50% per gene)). In contrast  the humoral and/or cellular responses were strong for one patient and moderate for the other  indicating that a productive infection occurred at one stage of the infection. We speculate that the stimulation of APOBEC  the enzyme group that exchanges G for A in viral nucleic acids and is usually inhibited by the HIV protein Vif  has been amplified and made effective from the initial stage of the infection. Furthermore  we propose that a cure for HIV may occur through HIV endogenization in humans  as observed for many other retroviruses in mammals  rather than clearance of all traces of HIV from human cells  which defines viral eradication."

Zebra finches  a representative songbird and a premier model for understanding the neurobiology of vocal production and learning  learn song in a manner analogous to how humans learn speech. Here we show that when allowed access  finches readily drink alcohol  increase their blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) significantly  and sing a song with altered acoustic structure. The most pronounced effects were decreased amplitude and increased entropy  the latter likely reflecting a disruption in the birds’ ability to maintain the spectral structure of song under alcohol. Furthermore  specific syllables  which have distinct acoustic structures  were differentially influenced by alcohol  likely reflecting a diversity in the neural mechanisms required for their production. Remarkably  these effects on vocalizations occurred without overt effects on general behavioral measures  and importantly  they occurred within a range of BEC that can be considered risky for humans. Our results suggest that the variable effects of alcohol on finch song reflect differential alcohol sensitivity of the brain circuitry elements that control different aspects of song production. They also point to finches as an informative model for understanding how alcohol affects the neuronal circuits that control the production of learned motor behaviors."

This behavior has been attributed to the large configurational entropy when five of more elements at near-equiatomic ratios are mixed together.[1 2]These high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have demonstrated the potential for superior properties in many cases. A fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of phase stability of HEAs is still a topic of active research. Guo and Liu demonstrated that compositions likely to form solid solution HEAs have enthalpies of mixing between −22 and 7 kJ/mol and very small differences in atomic radius. The small enthalpy of mixing allows the configurational entropy to dominate the free energy and it has been proposed that the system behaves  in this case  more like an ideal solution.[3] Otto et al. recently published a systematic investigation on the effect of entropy on phase stability of HEAs.[4] The authors demonstrated that high configurational entropy is not the only sufficient criterion to predict whether an equiatomic multi-component alloy will form as a single-phase solid solution. In their study  they found only NiFeCrCoMn to be a single-phase fcc solid solution and HEA. These findings are consistent with the work of Guo and Liu [3] as all the enthalpies of mixing in the respective binary alloys are relatively small and the atoms are similar in size. The authors then replaced individual elements in an equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn alloy one at a time with elements that have the same room temperature crystal structure  similar atomic size  and similar electronegativity as comparedwith the elements being replaced. All other substitutions to the NiFeCrCoMn alloy led to a multi-phase alloy. Although the replacement elements were ‘similar’ according to Hume-Rothery rules  the authors found that the substituted elements had a stronger propensity to form secondary phases or intermetallics in their respective binary alloys. This led the system to act less like an ideal solution and resulted in the formation of a multi-phase alloy with a reduced overall entropy.[4] There has also been interest in finding descriptors to predict the likely crystallographic lattice (fcc or bcc)that the solid solution will form upon.

Previous work implicates human primary visual cortex (V1) as the neural substrate mediating this contextual effect. Here we studied in healthy adult humans how two different types of context (large or small inducers) in this illusion affected size perception by comparing each to a reference stimulus without any context. We found that individual differences in the magnitudes of the illusion produced by either type of context were correlated with V1 area defined through retinotopic mapping using functional MRI. However  participants' objective ability to discriminate the size of objects presented in isolation was unrelated to illusion strength and did not correlate with V1 area. Control analyses showed no correlations between behavioral measures and the overall V1 area estimated probabilistically on the basis of neuroanatomy alone. Therefore  subjective size perception correlated with variability in central cortical magnification rather than the anatomical extent of primary visual cortex. We propose that such changes in subjective perception of size are mediated by mechanisms that scale with the extent to which an individual's V1 selectively represents the central visual field."

Observations of oviparity and of extended parental care in M. dermatophaga are the first reproductive mode data for any species of the genus. Microcaecilia dermatophaga is the third species  and represents the third genus  for which there has been direct observation of young animals feeding on the skin of their attending mother.

Flux measurements in both the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets indicate that the micrometeorites deliver to the Earth's surface ∼2000× more extraterrestrial material than brought by meteorites. Mineralogical and chemical studies of Antarctic micrometeorites indicate that they are only related to the relatively rare CM and CR carbonaceous chondrite groups  being mostly chondritic carbonaceous objects composed of highly unequilibrated assemblages of anhydrous and hydrous minerals. However  there are also marked differences between these two families of solar system objects  including higher C/O ratios and a very marked depletion of chondrules in micrometeorite matter; hence  they are “chondrites-without-chondrules.” Thus  the parent meteoroids of micrometeorites represent a dominant and new population of solar system objects  probably formed in the outer solar system and delivered to the inner solar system by the most appropriate vehicles  comets. One of the major purposes of this paper is to discuss applications of micrometeorite studies that have been previously presented to exobiologists but deal with the synthesis of prebiotic molecules on the early Earth  and more recently  with the early history of the solar system."

A few previous reports and our expanded psychophysical studies here reveal that humans can detect IR at wavelengths longer than 1 000 nm and perceive it as visible light  a finding that has not received a satisfactory physical explanation. We show that IR light activates photoreceptors through a nonlinear optical process. IR light also caused photoisomerization of purified pigments and a model chromophore compound. These observations are consistent with our quantum mechanical model for the energetics of two-photon activation of rhodopsin. Thus  humans can perceive IR light via two-photon isomerization of visual pigment chromophores. Vision relies on photoactivation of visual pigments in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina. The human eye structure and the absorption spectra of pigments limit our visual perception of light. Our visual perception is most responsive to stimulating light in the 400- to 720-nm (visible) range. First  we demonstrate by psychophysical experiments that humans can perceive infrared laser emission as visible light. Moreover  we show that mammalian photoreceptors can be directly activated by near infrared light with a sensitivity that paradoxically increases at wavelengths above 900 nm  and display quadratic dependence on laser power  indicating a nonlinear optical process. Biochemical experiments with rhodopsin  cone visual pigments  and a chromophore model compound 11-cis-retinyl-propylamine Schiff base demonstrate the direct isomerization of visual chromophore by a two-photon chromophore isomerization. Indeed  quantum mechanics modeling indicates the feasibility of this mechanism. Together  these findings clearly show that human visual perception of near infrared light occurs by two-photon isomerization of visual pigments."

The holotype consists of an incomplete skull  partly articulated axial skeleton  and fragmentary appendicular skeleton. A well-preserved braincase and skull roof provide rare insights into the poorly known neurocranial anatomy of mamenchisaurids and reveal a unique combination of characters such as an accessory tuber at the base of planar basipterygoid process and parietal excluding frontal from the anterior margin of the supratemporal fenestra. The cervical vertebrae have a distinct finger-like process extending from the postzygapophyseal process beside a zygapophyseal contact. Qijianglong is the first mamenchisaurid from the Late Jurassic of China that is definitively distinct from Mamenchisaurus  indicating greater morphological and taxonomic diversity of the poorly represented Late Jurassic mamenchisaurids. The occurrence of Qijianglong is consistent with a scenario in which mamenchisaurids formed an endemic sauropod fauna in the Late Jurassic of Asia. Phylogenetically  Qijianglong represents a relatively plesiomorphic mamenchisaurid lineage. The mamenchisaurids form an ancient clade of basal eusauropod dinosaurs that likely appeared in the Early Jurassic. A cladistic analysis highlights the interrelationships of mamenchisaurids and suggests guidelines for mamenchisaurid taxonomic revision. It may be desirable to restrict generic names to the type species in order to avoid confusion."

Here  we report that these differential prooxidative effects are associated with sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)  an important mitochondrial redox modulator. Methods and results EGCG rapidly induced mitochondria-localized reactive oxygen species in human oral squamous carcinoma cells (SCC-25  SCC-9) and premalignant leukoplakia cells (MSK-Leuk1)  but not in normal human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF-1). EGCG suppressed SIRT3 mRNA and protein expression  as well as  SIRT3 activity in SCC-25 cells  whereas it increased SIRT3 activity in HGF-1 cells. EGCG selectively decreased the nuclear localization of the estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα)  the transcription factor regulating SIRT3 expression  in SCC-25 cells. This indicates that EGCG may regulate SIRT3 transcription in oral cancer cells via ERRα. EGCG also differentially modulated the mRNA expressions of SIRT3-associated downstream targets including glutathione peroxidase 1 and superoxide dismutase 2 in normal and oral cancer cells. Conclusion: SIRT3 represents a novel potential target through which EGCG exerts differential prooxidant effects in cancer and normal cells. Our results provide new biomarkers to be further explored in animal studies."

Preliminary modeling showed that the reentry of ejecta would have caused a global infrared (IR) pulse sufficient to ignite global fires within a few hours of the Chicxulub impact. This heat pulse and subsequent fires explain the terrestrial survival patterns in the earliest Paleocene  because all the surviving species were plausibly able to take shelter from heat and fire underground or in water. However  new models of the global IR heat pulse as well as the absence of charcoal and the presence of noncharred organic matter have been said to be inconsistent with the idea of global fires that could have caused the extinctions. It was suggested that the soot in the debris layer originated from the impact site itself because the morphology of the soot  the chain length of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  and the presence of carbon cenospheres were said to be inconsistent with burning the terrestrial biosphere. These assertions either are incorrect or have alternate explanations that are consistent with global firestorms. We show that the apparent charcoal depletion in the Cretaceous-Paleogene layer has been misinterpreted due to the failure to correct properly for sediment deposition rates. We also show that the mass of soot potentially released from the impact site is far too low to supply the observed soot. However  global firestorms are consistent with both data and physical modeling."

Eyes from the duck-billed platypus and four key evolutionary basal vertebrates (Pacific hagfish  north hemisphere sea lamprey  and Australian and South American lungfishes) were prepared for light microscopy. In addition to a standard panel of stains  tissues were immunostained against a variety of rod and cone opsins. Finally  published opsin sequences of platypus and several other vertebrate species were aligned and compared with immunohistochemical results. A complete scleral cartilage similar to that seen in birds  reptiles and amphibians encloses the platypus eye. This feature is present in sharks and rays  and in extant relatives of tetrapods  the lungfishes. The choroid lacks a tapetum. The retina is largely avascular and is rod-dominated  with a minority of red- and blue- cone immunoreactive photoreceptors. Like marsupials and many nonmammalian vertebrates  cones contain clear inner segment droplets. Double cones were present  a feature not found in eutherian mammals or marsupials. Evaluation of opsins indicates that red and blue immunoreactive cone opsins  but not rhodopsin  are present in the most basal of the extant species examined  the Pacific hagfish. Rhodopsin appears in the Australian and South American lungfishes  establishing emergence of this pigment in an extant relative of tetrapods. Unlike eyes of eutherian mammals  the platypus eye has retained morphologic features present in early tetrapods such as amphibians and their evolutionarily basal sister group  the lungfishes.

Yet closing one's eyes in front of a stranger could sometimes create social discomfort  which other studies suggest can impair memory reports. This paper reports two experiments exploring the extent to which the memory benefits of eyeclosure are enhanced when efforts are taken to build interviewer/witness rapport  thus potentially reducing discomfort. Methods: In both studies participants observed filmed events and  afterwards  half underwent a basic rapport-building exercise with an interviewer. All participants then answered closed questions about specific details of the event  and half were instructed to close their eyes throughout this questioning. We recorded the proportion of questions answered correctly  incorrectly  or with ‘don't know’ responses. Results: Both eyeclosure and rapport-building separately enhanced correct responding. The data offer no evidence  though  that rapport-building moderated this eyeclosure benefit. This is despite the fact that rapport-building did appear to moderate the effect of eyeclosure on participants' self-reported comfort during the interviews. Conclusions These studies give us initial cause for doubt over a hypothesized – but heretofore untested – social psychological constraint on the benefits of eyeclosure."

Genetic analyses suggest this is the longest documented case of sperm storage for any species of shark (45 months). On January 2012  a pup of Chiloscyllium punctatum Müller & Henle 1838 was born at the Steinhart Aquarium of the California Academy of Sciences (CAS; Fig. 1). What makes this event unusual is that one female of C. punctatum laid this egg after at least 45 months of complete isolation from males. The last time the three potential mothers of the pup could have been in contact with a male was at the Aquarium of the Pacific  from which they were acquired in September 2007. The three females were moved to the temporary location of the Steinhart Aquarium in downtown San Francisco  where they started producing eggs immediately. These eggs were not closely monitored at the time and were eventually discarded. A year later  the females were moved to new aquarium facilities in Golden Gate Park  in an exhibit where all other shark specimens are female blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus (Quoy & Gaimard 1824)  and the only male individual is a Javanese cownose ray Rhinoptera javanica Müller & Henle 1841. Recent studies have documented hybridization between closely related chondrichthyans (Morgan et al.  2012) but the phylogenetic distance between the male R. javanica and the female C. punctatum is such that successful reproduction would be highly improbable. After a few weeks in the exhibit  the females started producing up to six egg cases per week. It was not possible to determine which females produced the eggs or how many eggs each female produced. Starting on January 2011  egg cases were collected from the enclosure and relocated to a separate shark egg exhibit  where their development was monitored. Two of the egg cases started showing embryonic development on 16 November 2011. One of the eggs hatched on 21 January 2012  while the other did not fully develop. Considering that the females had not been in contact with males for an extended period  there are two hypotheses that could explain the origin of the pup: (1) long-term sperm storage by one of the female C. punctatum or (2) facultative parthenogenesis  which has been previously demonstrated for the closely related whitespotted bamboo shark Chiloscyllium plagiosum (Bennett 1830) (Feldheim et al.  2010)."

In-vitro studies reveal the tattoo sensor’s linear response toward physiologically relevant glucose levels with negligible interferences from common coexisting electroactive species. The iontophoretic-biosensing tattoo platform is reduced to practice by applying the device on human subjects and monitoring variations in glycemic levels due to food consumption. Correlation of the sensor response with that of a commercial glucose meter underscores the promise of the tattoo sensor to detect glucose levels in a noninvasive fashion. Control on-body experiments demonstrate the importance of the reverse iontophoresis operation and validate the sensor specificity. This preliminary investigation indicates that the tattoo-based iontophoresis-sensor platform holds considerable promise for efficient diabetes management and can be extended toward noninvasive monitoring of other physiologically relevant analytes present in the interstitial fluid."

Despite the variety of existing materials with high surface areas and high CO2 uptake performances  the cost of the materials remains a dominant factor in slowing their industrial applications. Here we report preparation and CO2 uptake performance of microporous carbon materials synthesized from asphalt  a very inexpensive carbon source. Carbonization of asphalt with potassium hydroxide (KOH) at high temperatures (>600 °C) yields porous carbon materials (A-PC) with high surface areas of up to 2780 m2 g–1 and high CO2 uptake performance of 21 mmol g–1 or 93 wt % at 30 bar and 25 °C. Furthermore  nitrogen doping and reduction with hydrogen yields active N-doped materials (A-NPC and A-rNPC) containing up to 9.3% nitrogen  making them nucleophilic porous carbons with further increase in the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas up to 2860 m2 g–1 for A-NPC and CO2 uptake to 26 mmol g–1 or 114 wt % at 30 bar and 25 °C for A-rNPC. This is the highest reported CO2 uptake among the family of the activated porous carbonaceous materials. Thus  the porous carbon materials from asphalt have excellent properties for reversibly capturing CO2 at the well-head during the extraction of natural gas  a naturally occurring high pressure source of CO2.

Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants (age; 22.9±3.1 yrs) each observed  then rated  eight purpose-made videos (3 min duration) that depicted actors with either their right or left hand in visibly warm (warm videos) or cold water (cold videos). Four control videos with the actors' hand in front of the water were also shown. Temperature of participant observers' right and left hands was concurrently measured using a thermistor within a Wheatstone bridge with a theoretical temperature sensitivity of <0.0001°C.

Results: Participants rated the videos showing hands immersed in cold water as being significantly cooler than hands immersed in warm water  F(1 34) = 256.67  p<0.001.

This is particularly apparent when mating increases the risk of predation  either by increasing conspicuousness  reducing mobility or inhibiting an individual's ability to detect predators. Individuals may mitigate the risk of predation by altering their reproductive behavior (e.g. increasing anti-predator responses to reduce conspicuousness). The degree to which individuals modulate their reproductive behavior in relation to predation risk is difficult to predict because both the optimal investment in current and future reproduction (due to life-history strategies) and level of predation risk may differ between the sexes and among species. Here  we investigate the effect of increased predation risk on the reproductive behavior of dumpling squid (Euprymna tasmanica). Results: Females  but not males  showed a substantial increase in the number of inks (an anti-predator behavior) before mating commenced in the presence of a predator (sand flathead Platycephalus bassensis). However  predation risk did not affect copulation duration  the likelihood of mating  female anti-predator behavior during or after mating or male anti-predator behavior at any time. Conclusions: Inking is a common anti-predator defense in cephalopods  thought to act like a smokescreen  decoy or distraction. Female dumpling squid are probably using this form of defense in response to the increase in predation risk prior to mating. Conversely  males were undeterred by the increase in predation risk. A lack of change in these variables may occur if the benefit of completing mating outweighs the risk of predation. Prioritizing current reproduction  even under predation risk  can occur when the chance of future reproduction is low  there is substantial energetic investment into mating  or the potential fitness payoffs of mating are high."

The new species is endemic to Sulawesi Island  Indonesia. This is the fourth valid species of Limnonectes described from Sulawesi despite that the radiation includes at least 15 species and possibly many more. Fewer than a dozen of the 6455 species of frogs in the world are known to have internal fertilization  and of these  all but the new species either deposit fertilized eggs or give birth to froglets. The Indonesian island of Sulawesi in central Indonesia is home to a largely unstudied radiation of fanged frogs in the genus Limnonectes Fitzinger  1843 (Anura: Dicroglossidae Anderson  1871). To date  only three species are recognized from Sulawesi  but at least 15 species occur on the island [1]  [2]  [3]. It was recently proposed that Sulawesi fanged frogs represent an adaptive radiation based on patterns of morphological diversification among co-distributed species  and correspondence of morphological features (body size  webbing) with habitat utilization [3]. Adult body size ranges from ∼2 g to more than 900 g in members of the Sulawesi assemblage  with large-bodied species found in close association with fast moving rivers  and small-bodied species occupying more terrestrial niches in forest leaf-litter and on the banks of slow moving streams. Iskandar and Tjan [4] first documented that there are multiple undescribed species of Limnonectes on Sulawesi  and indicated that one of the constituent species utilizes an unusual ovoviviparous reproductive strategy. Here we describe that species  and provide additional details on its reproductive mode."

For this task  a sensor array based on cross-responsive mechanism was designed. A special gas chamber was made to insure sensor array exposed to VOCs sufficiently and evenly  and FLUENT software was used to simulate the performance of the gas chamber. The data collection and processing system was used to detect fluorescent changes of the sensor arrays before and after reaction  and to extract unique patterns of the tested VOCs. Four selected VOCs  p-xylene  styrene  isoprene  and hexanal  were detected by the proposed device. Unsupervised pattern recognition methods  hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis  were used to analyze data. The results showed that the methods could 100% discriminate the four VOCs. What is more  combined with artificial neural network  the correct rate of quantitative detection was up to 100%  and the device obtained responses at concentrations below 50 ppb. In conclusion  the proposed detection device showed excellent selectivity and discrimination ability for the VOCs related to lung cancer. Furthermore  our preliminary study demonstrated that the proposed detection device has brilliant potential application for early clinical diagnosis of lung cancer."

We examined iron-binding plasma proteins from AD patients and healthy controls from the Australian Imaging  Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing using size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Peak area corresponding to transferrin (Tf) saturation was directly compared to routine pathological testing. We found a significant decrease in transferrin-associated iron in AD that was missed by routine pathological tests of transferrin saturation  and that was able to discriminate between AD and controls. The AD cases showed no significant difference in transferrin concentration  only a decrease in total transferrin-bound iron. These findings support that a previously identified decrease in plasma iron levels in AD patients within the AIBL study is attributable to decreased loading of iron into transferrin  and that this subtle but discriminatory change is not observed through routine pathological testing."

It did not change the number of spleen-derived lymphocytes in BALB/c mice  the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes  and the level of IgG or IgM in Sprague–Dawley rat. The contact angle  tensile strength  and weight loss temperature of collagen nanofibers were 21.2°  6.72 ± 0.44 MPa  and 300 °C  respectively. The nanofibers could promote the viabilities of human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs)  inducing epidermal differentiation through the gene expression of involucrin  filaggrin  and type I transglutaminase of HaCaTs  and they could also accelerate migration of HaCaTs with the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Besides  the nanofibers could upregulate the protien level of Col-I in HDFs both via a direct effect and TGF-β1 secreted from HaCaTs  thus facilitating the formation of collagen fibers. Furthermore  the collagen nanofibers stimulated the skin regeneration rapidly and effectively in vivo. These biological effects could be explained as the contributions from the biomimic extracellular cell matrix structure  hydrophilicity  and the multiple amino acids of the collagen nanofibers."

Specifically  we translated 83 kB of information to 4991 DNA segments  each 158 nucleotides long  which were encapsulated in silica. Accelerated aging experiments were performed to measure DNA decay kinetics  which show that data can be archived on DNA for millennia under a wide range of conditions. The original information could be recovered error free  even after treating the DNA in silica at 70 °C for one week.

An important target in this area is the bacterial attachment and subsequent biofilm formation on medical devices (e.g.  catheters). Here we describe nonfouling  lubricant-infused slippery polymers as proof-of-concept medical materials that are based on oil-infused polydimethylsiloxane (iPDMS). Planar and tubular geometry silicone substrates can be infused with nontoxic silicone oil to create a stable  extremely slippery interface that exhibits exceptionally low bacterial adhesion and prevents biofilm formation. Analysis of a flow culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa through untreated PDMS and iPDMS tubing shows at least an order of magnitude reduction of biofilm formation on iPDMS  and almost complete absence of biofilm on iPDMS after a gentle water rinse. The iPDMS materials can be applied as a coating on other polymers or prepared by simply immersing silicone tubing in silicone oil  and are compatible with traditional sterilization methods. As a demonstration  we show the preparation of silicone-coated polyurethane catheters and significant reduction of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation on the catheter surface. This work represents an important first step toward a simple and effective means of preventing bacterial adhesion on a wide range of materials used for medical devices."

The study design encompassed an initial 4 wk of wash-out  followed by 4 wk of coffee intake and 4 wk of second wash-out. At the start and after each study phase blood samples were taken to monitor biomarkers of oxidative stress response. In addition  body weight/composition and intake of energy/nutrients were recorded.

Using all three available AFOLU datasets employed for analysis in the IPCC AR5  rather than just one as done in the IPCC AR5 WGIII Summary for Policy Makers  our analyses point to a down-revision of global AFOLU shares of total anthropogenic emissions  while providing important additional information on subsectoral trends. Our findings confirm that the share of AFOLU emissions to the anthropogenic total declined over time. They indicate a decadal average of 28.7 ± 1.5% in the 1990s and 23.6 ± 2.1% in the 2000s and an annual value of 21.2 ± 1.5% in 2010. The IPCC AR5 had indicated a 24% share in 2010. In contrast to previous decades  when emissions from land use (land use  land use change and forestry  including deforestation) were significantly larger than those from agriculture (crop and livestock production)  in 2010 agriculture was the larger component  contributing 11.2 ± 0.4% of total GHG emissions  compared to 10.0 ± 1.2% of the land use sector. Deforestation was responsible for only 8% of total anthropogenic emissions in 2010  compared to 12% in the 1990s. Since 2010  the last year assessed by the IPCC AR5  new FAO estimates indicate that land use emissions have remained stable  at about 4.8 Gt CO2 eq yr−1 in 2012. Emissions minus removals have also remained stable  at 3.2 Gt CO2 eq yr−1 in 2012. By contrast  agriculture emissions have continued to grow  at roughly 1% annually  and remained larger than the land use sector  reaching 5.4 Gt CO2 eq yr−1 in 2012. These results are useful to further inform the current climate policy debate on land use  suggesting that more efforts and resources should be directed to further explore options for mitigation in agriculture  much in line with the large efforts devoted to REDD+ in the past decade."

The arguments are often heated and personal; but they also illustrate some of the most fascinating challenges for epidemiology  risk communication  and evidence based policy. With regard to the use of bicycle helmets  science broadly tries to answer two main questions. At a societal level  “what is the effect of a public health policy that requires or promotes helmets?” and at an individual level  “what is the effect of wearing a helmet?” Both questions are methodologically challenging and contentious. The linked paper by Dennis and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj.f2674) investigates the policy question and concludes that the effect of Canadian helmet legislation on hospital admission for cycling head injuries “seems to have been minimal.”1 Other ecological studies have come to different conclusions 2 but the current study has somewhat superior methodology—controlling for background trends and modelling head injuries as a proportion of all cycling injuries."

Two hundred and forty-four community members and 280 police officers in Victoria  Australia (total sample 61% male  mean age=43.3  SD = 13.3) completed the SRAQ. Full information factor analysis identified three underlying stalking-related attitudes: “stalking isn't serious”  “stalking is romantic” and “victims are to blame”. Males endorsed all to a greater extent than females  whereas police and community only differed in that police believed stalking to be more serious. Stronger stereotype endorsement was related to judgements of not guilty in a fictional stalking case. These results indicate that attitudes and beliefs that downplay  excuse and normalise stalking behaviour can be measured  and have some influence on recognition of stalking behaviour."

Objectives: To assess hair colour and greying in a large world sample of human subjects  and to revisit the validity of the 50/50/50 rule of thumb  which states that ‘at age 50 years  50% of the population has at least 50% grey hair’. Methods: The natural hair colour of 4192 healthy male and female volunteers was assessed using a sensorial expert evaluation through the comparison of each volunteer’s hair with standard swatches. Hair colour was studied according to age  gender and ethnic or geographical origin. Results: Overall we observed that between 45 and 65 years of age  74% of people were affected by grey hair with a mean intensity of 27%. Men harboured significantly more grey hair than women. Both age at onset and rate of greying with age appeared to be clearly linked to ethnic/geographical origin. Subjects of Asian and African descent showed less grey hair than those of caucasian origin  at comparable ages  confirming previously reported data. Conclusions: Calculating the percentage of people showing at least 50% grey hair coverage at age 50 years leads to a global range of 6–23%  according to ethnic/geographical origin and natural hair colour: well below that expressed by the ‘50’ rule of thumb."

In such cases  some simple adaptations to standard CBT for insomnia are useful. This article reviews the typical assessment and CBT for adult insomnia  which have substantial empirical support for its efficacy. A case illustrates the core treatment processes and demonstrates that improving sleep in the context of conditions like chronic pain can lead to better management of such conditions. Chronic insomnia  whether it presents alone or in combination with another medical or psychiatric disorder  tends to persist in the absence of direct intervention. Cognitive–behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is one treatment with strong support for its efficacy and growing support for its effectiveness (Leshner  2005).

It is widely accepted  however  that multicomponent CBT-I is the preferred approach. In this article  I review the typical assessment strategies and differential diagnoses for adult insomnia.

Unlike prefabricated sensors  this approach empowers the end user with the ability of “on-demand” and “on-site” designing and fabricating of biocatalytic sensors to suit their specific requirement.

In the spider Stegodyphus lineatus Latreille 1817 (Eresidae)  maternal care is extreme and irreversible: mothers regurgitate food for the young and then die when consumed by them (matriphagy). We examined whether the mother's midgut tissues undergo structural changes in preparation for regurgitation and matriphagy. Our histological data show that the midgut diverticula (MD) tissues start to degrade during the egg sac incubation period. When the young emerge from the egg sac  the midgut tissues are partly liquefied and are retained within the MD. The degradation process intensifies when the female feeds her young by regurgitation and liquid tissue is observed within and among the diverticula lobes. The presence of the lumen of a diverticulum during the regurgitation process suggests that degenerated tissues enter the lumen and form the regurgitated fluid. At matriphagy  the abdomen is filled with liquid containing nutritional vacuoles  which the young imbibe after piercing the female's abdomen. We conclude that the MD undergoes a gradual degradation process that maximizes the nutritional potential of the female's body and finally enables complete consumption of her soma. These changes are consistent with the extreme semelparous reproductive system of S. lineatus  where a female invests all of her resources into a single reproductive event. This is the first demonstration of the mechanism underlying suicidal maternal care in an arthropod."

By modifying the amount of thermally responsive PNIPAAm network in the hydrogels  the gels showed reversible length changes of 41%–49% when heated and cooled between 20 and 60 °C. Blocked stresses generated in tension were in the range of 10–21 kPa. We were able to fabricate a smart valve that controls the flow of water by printing a dynamic alginate/PNIPAAm ICE gel ink alongside other static materials. The valve automatically closed upon exposure to hot water  reducing the flow rate by 99%  and opened in cold water. With CAD modeling this 4D printing technique can be easily extended to make other types of moving structures.

Here we report an artificial photosynthetic scheme that functions via a similar two-step process by developing a biocompatible light-capturing nanowire array that enables a direct interface with microbial systems. As a proof of principle  we demonstrate that a hybrid semiconductor nanowire–bacteria system can reduce CO2 at neutral pH to a wide array of chemical targets  such as fuels  polymers  and complex pharmaceutical precursors  using only solar energy input.

Measures included an ankle worn activity monitor  an external light monitor and the Barr Baby Day Diary in which parents recorded periods of sleep  crying  feeding and other behaviours at 5-min intervals throughout the 24-h period. Fifty-six babies (26 males and 30 females) were monitored across three consecutive days at 6  9 and 12 weeks of age. There was an early evening peak in crying which was associated with reduced sleep at 6 weeks. Across the trials there was a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of sleep occurring at night. Sleeping well at 6 weeks was a good indication of more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks. Babies who slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in the early afternoon period. These data suggest that light in the normal domestic setting influences the development of the circadian system."

Mice that drank water laced with the programmed bacteria ate less  had lower body fat and staved off diabetes — even when fed a high-fat diet — offering a potential weight-loss strategy for humans. The team will describe their approach in one of nearly 11 000 presentations at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS)  the world’s largest scientific society  taking place here through Thursday. Obesity strongly increases the risk for developing several diseases and conditions  such as heart disease  stroke  type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. One in three Americans is obese  and efforts to stem the epidemic have largely failed. Lifestyle changes and medication typically achieve only modest weight loss  and most people regain the weight. In recent years  numerous studies have shown that the population of microbes living in the gut may be a key factor in determining the risk for obesity and related diseases  suggesting that strategically altering the gut microbiome may impact human health. One advantage to microbial medicine would be that it's low maintenance  says Sean Davies  Ph.D. His goal is to produce therapeutic bacteria that live in the gut for six months or a year  providing sustained drug delivery. This is in contrast to weight-loss drugs that typically need to be taken at least daily  and people tend not to take their medications as directed over time. “So we need strategies that deliver the drug without requiring the patient to remember to take their pills every few hours ” Davies says."

Some women  though  find themselves unable to breast feed. Although some of them turn to clinicians and health visitors for advice  as many as three quarters of new mothers now look to the internet for guidance.1 Online these women find emotive  moralising discourse around breast feeding and often fear inducing warnings that formula is inferior to human milk for infant feeding. They may also find sites that facilitate the buying  selling  and trading of breast milk  as well as high profile media sites featuring celebrities who are engaged in this trade. In the absence of warnings about the dangers of buying milk online  this option might seem healthy and beneficial—the better choice if one can’t breast feed oneself.2 What mothers  and many healthcare workers  don’t realise is that this market is dangerous  putting infant health at risk. The online market in human milk  growing fastest in the United States  is now also gaining popularity elsewhere  largely among mothers ineligible for milk from milk banks. Although a narrow group of adult consumers (including people with cancer  gym enthusiasts  and fetishists) buy milk online  most buyers are parents who require other women’s milk for supplementation or as the sole source of nutrition for their infants. In countries such as the United States where milk banks charge up to $4 (£2.7; €3.7) an ounce  online milk is often the cheaper option. Unlike regulated bank milk  no expense is incurred in routine pasteurisation or testing for disease or contamination  and collection  storage  and shipping requirements are negotiated between buyer and seller  enabling prices to be kept lower.3 Troublingly  these cost saving measures lead to a high risk of communicable disease transmission  contamination  and tampering.4 Unlike donors at licensed milk banks online sellers are not required to undergo any serological screening  meaning that diseases such as hepatitis B and C  HIV  human T cell lymphotropic virus  and syphilis may not be detected.5 6 7 One study comparing milk bought online with that from licensed milk banks found that 21% of the samples bought online were positive for cytomegalovirus  compared with only 5% of bank samples.6 Samples bought online also showed higher overall bacterial growth  with only 9 of the 101 samples not having detectable bacterial growth. This is partly owing to the lack of pasteurisation but also to poor shipping and storage conditions. One study of 102 samples purchased online found that 25% of samples arrived with severely damaged packaging and were no longer frozen  leading to more rapid bacterial growth and contamination.7 Other studies identified occasional contamination with bisphenol A8 and illicit drugs5 and tampering including the addition of cow’s milk or water to increase volume (as milk is sold online per ounce).9 Such contamination cannot easily be detected before infant feeding."

Method: We conducted a search of PubMed from 1996 to 2010 using the terms ‘autism ’‘learning ’‘memory ’ and ‘neuroimaging.’ We limited our review to studies correlating learning and memory function with neuroimaging features of the brain. Results: The early literature supports the following preliminary hypotheses: (1) abnormalities of hippocampal subregions may contribute to autistic deficits in episodic and relational memory; (2) disturbances to an amygdala-based network (which may include the fusiform gyrus  superior temporal cortex  and mirror neuron system) may contribute to autistic deficits in socio-emotional learning and memory; and (3) abnormalities of the striatum may contribute to developmental dyspraxia in individuals with ASD. Interpretation Characterizing the disturbances to learning and memory systems in ASD can inform our understanding of the neural bases of autistic behaviors and the phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD."

Using a multigenerational experiment with a marine fish  we provide the first evidence that parents developing from early life at elevated temperatures can adjust their offspring gender through nongenetic and nonbehavioural means. However  this adjustment was not possible when parents reproduced  but did not develop  at elevated temperatures. Complete restoration of the offspring sex ratio occurred when parents developed at 1.5 °C above the present-day average temperature for one generation. However  only partial improvement in the sex ratio occurred at 3.0 °C above average conditions  even after two generations  suggesting a limitation to transgenerational plasticity when developmental temperature is substantially increased. This study highlights the potential for transgenerational plasticity to ameliorate some impacts of climate change and that development from early life may be essential for expression of transgenerational plasticity in some traits."

Here  employing a serial reaction time task (SRTT) paradigm  we examined the question whether sleep can provide explicit knowledge on an implicitly acquired skill. At learning  young healthy subjects (n = 20) were first trained on the SRTT. Then  implicit knowledge was assessed on two test blocks  in which grammatically incorrect target positions were occasionally interspersed by the difference in reaction times between grammatically correct and incorrect target positions. To assess explicit sequence knowledge  thereafter subjects performed on a generation task in which they were explicitly instructed to predict the sequential target positions. In half the subjects  learning took place before a 9-hour retention interval filled with nocturnal sleep (sleep group)  in the other half  the retention interval covered a 9-hour period of daytime wakefulness (wake group). At subsequent retesting  both testing on the generation task and the SRTT test blocks was repeated. At learning before the retention interval  subjects displayed significant implicit sequence knowledge which was comparable for the sleep and wake groups. Moreover  both groups did not display any explicit sequence knowledge as indicated by a prediction performance not differing from chance on the generation task. However  at retesting  there was a distinct gain in explicit knowledge in the subjects who had slept in the retention interval  whereas generation task performance in the wake group remained at chance level. SRTT performance in the test blocks at retesting did not indicate any further gain in skill (i.e.  unchanged reaction time differences between grammatically correct and incorrect target positions) independently of whether subjects had slept or remained awake after learning. Our results indicate a selective enhancement of explicit memory formation during sleep. Because before sleep subjects only had implicit knowledge on the sequence of target transitions  these data point to an interaction between implicit and explicit memory systems during sleep-dependent off-line learning."

We approached the problem of the mechanism behind this innovation using an approach bridging paleontology  comparative anatomy  and experimental developmental biology. First  we used fossil and extant data to show the beak is distinctive in consisting of fused premaxillae that are geometrically distinct from those of ancestral archosaurs. To elucidate underlying developmental mechanisms  we examined candidate gene expression domains in the embryonic face: the earlier frontonasal ectodermal zone (FEZ) and the later midfacial WNT-responsive region  in birds and several reptiles. This permitted the identification of an autapomorphic median gene expression region in Aves. To test the mechanism  we used inhibitors of both pathways to replicate in chicken the ancestral amniote expression. Altering the FEZ altered later WNT responsiveness to the ancestral pattern. Skeletal phenotypes from both types of experiments had premaxillae that clustered geometrically with ancestral fossil forms instead of beaked birds. The palatal region was also altered to a more ancestral phenotype. This is consistent with the fossil record and with the tight functional association of avian premaxillae and palate in forming a kinetic beak."

Design Population based study. Setting Child and Adolescent Twin Study and national patient register  Sweden. Participants 19 993 twins (190 with autism spectrum disorder) and all children (n=1 078 975; 4620 with autism spectrum disorder) born in Sweden over a 10 year period from 1993 to 2002. Main: outcome measures Annual prevalence of the autism symptom phenotype (that is  symptoms on which the diagnostic criteria are based) assessed by a validated parental telephone interview (the Autism-Tics  ADHD and other Comorbidities inventory)  and annual prevalence of reported diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder in the national patient register. Results: The annual prevalence of the autism symptom phenotype was stable during the 10 year period (P=0.87 for linear time trend). In contrast  there was a monotonic significant increase in prevalence of registered diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder in the national patient register (P<0.001 for linear trend).Conclusions: The prevalence of the autism symptom phenotype has remained stable in children in Sweden while the official prevalence for registered  clinically diagnosed  autism spectrum disorder has increased substantially. This suggests that administrative changes  affecting the registered prevalence  rather than secular factors affecting the pathogenesis  are important for the increase in reported prevalence of autism spectrum disorder."

It is found to be 11 °C cooler than a commercial white cool roof nearby. A combination of specially chosen polymers and a silver thin film yields values near 100% for both solar reflectance  and thermal emittance at infrared wavelengths from 7.9 to 13 μm. If a surface is under intense sunlight and open to warm air  cooling to below ambient has up to now been an elusive target. The technical goal is super-cool roofing with thermal performance well above that of existing cool roofs. Stringent spectral requirements at solar and infrared (IR) wavelengths are needed  leading to quite limited choices for suitable coating materials and layer structure. Metal alone  except silver  cannot provide the required level of solar reflectance of above 96% and the thermal emittance of common metals is far too low to cool. Placing silver under a glass or polymer material with very low solar absorptance may cool well as high emittance Er results. However  options such as PMMA and most glasses absorb too much solar radiation. Low iron glass and various polyesters including PET absorb very little solar energy if thin  but their IR spectral response is not ideal for this task. Cooling is enhanced if IR spectral response in the thermal emission band involves a mix of moderate reflectance at those wavelengths where the atmosphere irradiates the earth under clear sky conditions and very high absorptance hence emission in the range from 7.9 μm < λ < 14 μm  called the “sky window ” which is largely free of incoming radiation as it views the cold of space. Super-cool surfaces require solar reflectance and sky window absorptance to be close to 100%. The admix of IR reflectance and absorptance in the down-welling atmospheric radiation band is less stringent but together with the sky window setting determines the value of overall thermal emittance Er which dictates the heat output rate at the roof temperature Tr. This radiative rate is an important practical consideration. Its final choice depends on total rate of heat input including the contribution of absorbed down-welling atmospheric radiation. We concluded that the desired combination of solar and IR criteria could be met using two or more specially chosen polyesters on a silver layer. At the set thickness  their IR absorptance had to be very strong in slightly different sections of the sky window with moderate transmittance at incoming wavelengths. A suitable surface was produced and set up outdoors. It remained subambient throughout a hot summer day including under the peak intense solar intensity of 1060 W m−2  with ambient at 27 °C  and high IR intensity from the atmosphere of 400 W m−2. "

We used fMRI in healthy adults to test the hypothesis that this stance is primed by the default mode of human brain function present when the mind is at rest. We report three findings that support this hypothesis. First  brain regions activated by actively adopting an intentional rather than nonintentional stance to a social stimulus were anatomically similar to those demonstrating default responses to fixation baseline in the same task. Second  moment-to-moment variation in default activity during fixation in the dorsomedial PFC was related to the ease with which participants applied an intentional—but not nonintentional—stance to a social stimulus presented moments later. Finally  individuals who showed stronger dorsomedial PFC activity at baseline in a separate task were generally more efficient when adopting the intentional stance and reported having greater social skills. These results identify a biological basis for the human tendency to adopt the intentional stance. More broadly  they suggest that the brain's default mode of function may have evolved  in part  as a response to life in a social world."

Faults identified from seafloor morphology were verified in the subsurface using existing seismic reflection data including single-channel and multichannel seismic profiles compiled over the past three decades. The two fault systems are parallel and are capable of large lateral offsets and reverse slip during earthquakes. The geometry of the fault systems shows evidence of multiple segments that could experience throughgoing rupture over distances exceeding 100 km. Published earthquake hypocenters from regional seismicity studies further define the lateral and depth extent of the historic fault ruptures. Historical and recent focal mechanisms obtained from first-motion and moment tensor studies confirm regional strain partitioning dominated by right slip on major throughgoing faults with reverse-oblique mechanisms on adjacent structures. Transpression on west and northwest trending structures persists as far as 270 km south of the Transverse Ranges; extension persists in the southern Borderland. A logjam model describes the tectonic evolution of crustal blocks bounded by strike-slip and reverse faults which are restrained from northwest displacement by the Transverse Ranges and the southern San Andreas fault big bend. Because of their potential for dip-slip rupture  the faults may also be capable of generating local tsunamis that would impact Southern California coastlines  including populated regions in the Channel Islands."

This therapy uses phages (natural bacterial enemies) to kill pathogens. However  it encounters many obstacles such as delivery barriers into the tissues and bacterial resistance to phages. Here  we use phages for delivering a programmable DNA nuclease  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated (Cas)  to reverse antibiotic resistance and eliminate the transfer of resistance between strains. This approach combines CRISPR-Cas delivery with lytic phage selection of antibiotic-sensitized bacteria. The strategy may reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in treated surfaces and on skin of medical personnel  as it uses phages in a unique way that overcomes many of the hurdles encountered by phage therapy. Abstract: The increasing threat of pathogen resistance to antibiotics requires the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Here we present a proof of concept for a genetic strategy that aims to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics and selectively kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We use temperate phages to deliver a functional clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated (Cas) system into the genome of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The delivered CRISPR-Cas system destroys both antibiotic resistance-conferring plasmids and genetically modified lytic phages. This linkage between antibiotic sensitization and protection from lytic phages is a key feature of the strategy. It allows programming of lytic phages to kill only antibiotic-resistant bacteria while protecting antibiotic-sensitized bacteria. Phages designed according to this strategy may be used on hospital surfaces and hand sanitizers to facilitate replacement of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with sensitive ones."

After developing a numerical model to properly design our cavity for high efficiencies in close cooperation with the EM Drive’s inventor  we built a breadboard out of copper with the possibility to tune the resonance frequency in order to match the resonance frequency of the magnetron which was attached on the side of the cavity. After measuring the Q-factor of our assembly  we connected the EMDrive to a commercial 700 W microwave magnetron. After a thermal mapping of the surfaces  we performed thrust measurements with a knife-edge balance as well as with a torsion balance in vacuum chamber. Our measurements reveal thrusts as expected from previous claims after carefully studying thermal and electromagnetic interferences. For the first time  measurements were also performed in high vacuum. Due to a low Q factor of <50  we observed thrusts of +/-20 µN. We identified the magnetic interaction of the power feeding lines going to and from the liquid metal contacts as the most important possible side-effect that is not fully characterized yet. Our test campaign can not confirm or refute the claims of the EMDrive but intends to independently assess possible side-effects in the measurements methods used so far. Nevertheless  we do observe thrusts close to the actual predictions after eliminating many possible error sources that should warrant further investigation into the phenomena. "

        "text": "Superhydrophobic surfaces can be obtained by tailoring both the chemistry and roughness topography  mimicking the Lotus leaf characteristics. Most of the synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces reported have been composed of micro and nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based coatings. The particles which tailor the topography are bonded to the base polymers by weak secondary forces. Consequently  the topography integrity is highly affected by handling and surface drag making them unsuitable for long term applications. This work is focused on promoting covalent bonding between the NPs and the base polymer to obtain durable superhydrophobic surfaces. The rough topography was achieved by ultraviolet (UV) curing of SiO2 NPs containing a photoreactive benzophenone moiety in addition to methylated fumed silica NPs which can bind covalently to the polymer base coating  on UV radiation. The hydrophobic chemistry was obtained by fluoroalkylsilane top coating. Coating durability was evaluated using surface air drag and accelerated weathering conditions (UV radiation  humidity and temperature). Results indicated that the proposed approach resulted in superhydrophobic surfaces having high contact angle (>150°) and low sliding angle (<10°) with improved long term durability."

However  previous studies show that ratings of likeness vary across different photographs of the same face  suggesting that some images capture identity better than others. Two experiments were designed to examine the relationship between likeness judgments and face matching accuracy. In Experiment 1  we compared unfamiliar face matching accuracy for self-selected and other-selected high-likeness images. Surprisingly  images selected by previously unfamiliar viewers – after very limited exposure to a target face – were more accurately matched than self-selected images chosen by the target identity themselves. Results also revealed extremely low inter-rater agreement in ratings of likeness across participants  suggesting that perceptions of image resemblance are inherently unstable. In Experiment 2  we test whether the cost of self-selection can be explained by this general disagreement in likeness judgments between individual raters. We find that averaging across rankings by multiple raters produces image selections that provide superior identification accuracy. However  benefit of other-selection persisted for single raters  suggesting that inaccurate representations of self interfere with our ability to judge which images faithfully represent our current appearance."

Factor analysis revealed three factors: physical aggression (killing  torture  and hitting)  direct verbal aggression (shouting and rage)  and indirect verbal aggression (being ironic and hindering). The basic factor structure of the Japanese  the Spanish  and the USA samples was similar. In all samples  men showed a higher justification of physical aggressive acts in any situation and of indirect verbal aggression in nondefensive circumstances. Cultural differences were found in the degree of justification of the three factors: in all kinds of situations  Japanese students showed a lower justification of indirect verbal aggression but a higher justification of direct verbal aggression than USA and Spain samples. Physical aggression in defensive situations is justified more by Americans than by Japanese and Spanish students. These findings suggest the existence of a common basic moral code about physical aggressive acts  but there seems to be a cultural influence on moral codes concerning verbal aggressive acts. Oriental cultures  with an interdependent construal of self  seem to be more permissive of direct verbal aggression compared with Western cultures  but they have less tolerance for indirect verbal aggression. There were practically no significant differences between American and Spanish scores."

However  the results of clinical trials investigating the effect of ketogenic diets on appetite are inconsistent. To evaluate quantitatively the effect of ketogenic diets on subjective appetite ratings  we conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of studies that assessed appetite with visual analogue scales before (in energy balance) and during (while in ketosis) adherence to VLED or KLCD. Individuals were less hungry and exhibited greater fullness/satiety while adhering to VLED  and individuals adhering to KLCD were less hungry and had a reduced desire to eat. Although these absolute changes in appetite were small  they occurred within the context of energy restriction  which is known to increase appetite in obese people. Thus  the clinical benefit of a ketogenic diet is in preventing an increase in appetite  despite weight loss  although individuals may indeed feel slightly less hungry (or more full or satisfied). Ketosis appears to provide a plausible explanation for this suppression of appetite. Future studies should investigate the minimum level of ketosis required to achieve appetite suppression during ketogenic weight loss diets  as this could enable inclusion of a greater variety of healthy carbohydrate-containing foods into the diet."

Employing standard cross-cultural methods  this research report is the first attempt to use a large sample set (eHRAF World Cultures  SCCS  and a selective ethnographer survey) to document the presence or absence of the romantic–sexual kiss (n = 168 cultures). We defined romantic–sexual kissing as lip-to-lip contact that may or may not be prolonged. Despite frequent depictions of kissing in a wide range of material culture  we found no evidence that the romantic–sexual kiss is a human universal or even a near universal. The romantic–sexual kiss was present in a minority of cultures sampled (46%).

        "text": "With all but two countries worldwide  Pakistan and Afghanistan  declared polio-free  the eradication of the devastating viral disease in the near future is a real possibility. A study published on August 27th in PLOS Pathogens reports results from an individual in the UK with an immune disease whose stool samples have contained large amounts of live polio virus for over 20 years. Patients like this one  the authors suggest  could start new polio outbreaks and complicate polio eradication as currently planned. There are three strains of wild polio virus (1  2  and 3) and two different types of polio vaccine. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is safe and effective in inducing neutralizing antibodies that protect against paralytic polio. It does not  however  induce substantial mucosal immunity and so prevent excretion of virus. Oral polio vaccine (OPV; which contains weakened  or \"attenuated\" live virus) is effective  and besides neutralizing antibodies induces mucosal immunity  thereby killing viruses in the gastro-intestinal tract and reducing excretion. OPV is less safe than IPV; on extremely rare occasions  it causes vaccine-associated paralytic polio  and because some shedding into the stool still occurs  it can also lead to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). Over 90% of such cVDPV are due to the strain 2 component  which has not been seen in the \"wild\" since 1999 and thus appears eradicated. As strain 2 OPV is also responsible for up to 38% of vaccine-associated paralytic polio cases  WHO plans to implement shortly a switch from trivalent OPV (containing strains 1 2 3) to bivalent OPV (containing only strains 1 and 3) in routine immunization programs. Following eradication  the plan is to stop use of all OPV in routine immunizations  while IPV immunizations are likely to continue for some time. In this study  Javier Martin  from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control  Potters Bar  UK  and colleagues  analyzed more than 100 stool samples collected between 1995 and 2015 from a white male. The individual received a full course of childhood immunizations  including OPV at 5  7  and 12 months  with a booster at about 7 years of age. He was later diagnosed with an immunodeficiency  which can affect the ability of the immune system to kill viruses in the digestive tract. The researchers found high levels of strain 2 polio virus in all stool samples analyzed. Analysis of the RNA of these iVDPV strains (i.e. strains of vaccine-derived polio virus from immune-deficient individuals) showed that the excreted viruses were different from the weakened vaccine strain  and that they had started to diverge from it an estimated 28 years ago  around the time of this individual's last known vaccination with OPV. All iVDPV strains had mutations that reversed the attenuating features of the vaccine strain  and over time they also acquired a range of other mutations  many affecting the antigenic structure of the virus. All tested iVDPV samples were able to cause paralysis in transgenic mice that had a human poliovirus receptor. Despite the extensive changes found in the iVDPV strains compared with the vaccine strain  the researchers found that human sera readily neutralized even the most divergent strain--reassuring results  they say  \"in that they indicate that vaccinated humans are well protected against infection with these highly drifted iVDPV strains\". However  they also state that \"because the sera tested correspond to a selected group of UK healthy adults between 28-65 years of age who had been vaccinated with a full course of four OPV doses plus at least one dose of IPV  whereas the UK switched from OPV to IPV for polio immunization in 2004  it would be helpful to test sera from cohorts that have only received IPV\". Putting the research into context of other studies on iVDPV  they emphasize that \"of the total of 73 iVDPV cases that have been described between 1962 and 2014  only seven involved infections lasting more than five years. The case described here represents by far the longest period of excretion described from such a patient and the only identified individual known to be excreting highly evolved vaccine-derived poliovirus at present\". However  the researchers also mention that several highly mutated VDPV strains that showed molecular properties typical of iVDPVs have recently been isolated from sewage samples in Slovakia  Finland  Estonia  and Israel  suggesting that an unknown number of chronic excreters exist elsewhere. The researchers conclude that \"enhanced surveillance including sewage sampling and stool surveys to search for the presence of iVDPV strains and the development of efficient anti-viral treatments to interrupt virus replication in immune-deficient individuals are needed to be able to identify and manage the possible risks of iVDPV strains spreading and causing disease in patients and the general population  particularly in the light of changes in vaccination strategies as part of the polio eradication endgame and the absence of an established outbreak response strategy\". They add that \"new polio vaccines such as those based on non-infectious virus-like particles or even new genetically designed stable live-attenuated versions with no associated risk of producing VDPVs  might be required to complete polio eradication\"."

Yet  few studies have focused on the effects of the total particulate matter from incense burning on human health. Here  we evaluate the health risks associated with the total particulate matter generated from burning incense indoors for the first time. The total particulate matter and major chemical components of two types of incense smoke were characterized using an electrical low pressure impactor and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Their genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were compared with mainstream tobacco smoke using in vitro assays. Our results show that both the particulate number and mass of incense smoke were dominated by ultrafine to fine particles. In addition  many aromatic  irritant  and toxic compounds were identified in the particulate fraction. In vitro assessments showed that the genotoxicity of the particulate matter from one particular incense sample was higher than the reference cigarette sample with the same dose. All particulate matter fractions from the incense investigated were found to possess greater cytotoxicity on Chinese hamster ovary cells than smoke from the reference cigarette. Collective assessment of these data will affect the evaluation of incense products and facilitate measures to reduce exposure to their smoke. Clearly  there needs to be greater awareness and management of the health risks associated with burning incense in indoor environments."

Regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with PP placement  type of PP utilized  and factors associated with revisions. Results: A total of 1 763 260 men were diagnosed with ED  3% (53 180) of whom underwent PP insertion. The utilization of PP for ED decreased from 4.6% in 2002 to 2.3% in 2010 (P < 0.01). This temporal decline in utilization was significant across all demographic factors including age  ethnicity  and geographic location. Men aged 65–74  from the U.S. South and West  and those with Charlson comorbidity scores >1 were more likely to have a PP inserted for ED (P < 0.01). African American men were more likely to have a semirigid PP placed compared with a multicomponent inflatable PP  and were more likely to undergo a revision or removal of the PP compared with Caucasian men (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The surgical management of ED with PP changed significantly between 2001 and 2010. The overall utilization of PP decreased  but its use in patients with significant medical comorbidities increased.

The scientists will present new research on flavor-saving methods at the 250th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS)  the world’s largest scientific society. The meeting features more than 9 000 reports on new advances in science and other topics. It is being held here through Thursday. “Ideally  tomatoes should be picked ripe and then sold immediately  as they are at farm stands ” says Jinhe Bai  Ph.D. But this isn’t always possible for commercially sold tomatoes  which are often stored and then shipped over long distances. To prevent tomatoes from becoming too ripe before they reach the store  growers pick them when they are still green. Packers then use a gas called ethylene to trigger fruit ripening  and after that the tomatoes are stored and shipped at low temperatures. The problem is that chilling tomatoes degrades their flavor  says Bai. In an effort to improve the flavor quality  his team developed a slightly different method. “To produce a better tasting tomato  we added a hot water pre-treatment step to the usual protocol that growers follow ” he explains. “We found that this pre-treatment step prevents flavor loss due to chilling.” Describing the process in more detail  Bai explains that he and his colleagues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture  Agricultural Research Service  and the University of Florida dipped Florida-grown green tomatoes in hot water (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit) for five minutes and then let them cool at room temperature. Next they chilled the fruit to between 41 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit  the temperatures commercial producers use for shipping. After the tomatoes fully ripened  the researchers tested them for flavor and aroma. They found that tomatoes heated before chilling had higher levels of flavor compounds (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one  2-methylbutanal and 2-phenylethanol) than non-heated fruit  and they tasted better  Bai says. “Chilling suppresses production of oxygen  nitrogen and sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds  ketones  alcohols and aldehydes  including 13 important aroma components of tomato flavor. But hot water-treated fruit actually produced higher concentrations of these important aroma contributors  even with subsequent chilling.” Currently  they are monitoring flavor compounds at additional time points — when the tomatoes are green  soon after the process is performed and when they are partially ripened. This information will be combined with data on fully ripened tomatoes to help the team develop a better commercial process. Bai says that his team’s approach is an easy  inexpensive fix to the flavor problem. Many post-harvest technologies sacrifice flavor to prevent bruising or spoiling  he points out. “Our methods can easily be implemented in the current commercial system without risking fruit decay ” he explains. They also tried alternative methods to hot water  such as incubating green tomatoes with methyl salicylate  also known as wintergreen oil  an antifungal fumigant that is “generally recognized as safe” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He says he and his colleagues have successfully preserved flavor with another method  too. With this procedure  they picked the tomatoes at a later stage than growers usually do. Instead of picking them when they were all green  the researchers waited and collected them when the fruits were half-green and half-pink (the breaker stage). Then  they treated them with 1-methylcyclopropene (a gas approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). They did this to make the fruit more tolerant to cell death and deterioration at higher storage temperatures. Thus the chilling step was avoided and the flavor maintained. The researchers plan to closely compare the flavor-saving qualities of all techniques. Once the researchers determine if one of the methods is better  they will approach food processing firms to determine if they are interested in adopting the technique  Bai says."

As (bio)chemical engineers we see DNA as a possibility of preserving large amounts of information: about 750 megabytes of genetic information are stored in every cell of our body and theoretically one gram of DNA could store > 300'000 terabytes of information.[1] Furthermore  it is known from archeology studies that if well preserved  DNA can endure for several hundred thousand years.[2] Within this presentation we will show how we can use modern chemical and information engineering tools for the safeguarding of actual digital information in the form of DNA. For this we have combined the information theory concept of forward error correction with the chemical tool of DNA encapsulation.[3 4] In a first experimental validation of the idea 83kB of digital information were encoded by a Reed-Solomon error correction code and translated to DNA sequences (4991 sequences each 117bp long). The DNA sequences were synthesized by a microarray technology and encapsulated into a silica matrix. This encapsulation resulted in very low DNA degradation rates  which were measured by accelerated aging experiments in various atmospheres. Following a simulated 2'000 year room temperature storage of the DNA the digital information could be recovered without error by the aid of the error correction capabilities introduced during the coding. Aside of giving an insight into the state of the art of information preservation in DNA we will also discuss future challenges and needs of digital data preservation in the form of chemical information."

Our proposal is based on deploying thousands of low-cost micro-satellites in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO)  each capable of providing Terabit/s data rates with signal latencies better than or equal to ground based systems. Mobile connectivity has transformed daily life across the globe becoming one of the most dramatic game-changing technologies the world has ever seen. As more people connect to the Internet  increasingly chat to friends and family  watch videos on the move  and listen to streamed music on their mobile devices  mobile data traffic continues to grow at unprecedented rates. Actually  this surge in demand is following what we can informally call an omnify principle. Here  omnify stands for Order of Magnitude Increase every Five Years. Which means  demand for data increases 10 times every 5 years and will continue to increase at this pace with expected 1 000 times increase in the next 15 years. This increase in demand is similar to the memory and computing power growth following Moore’s law which offered a million fold more memory capacity and the processing power in the last 30 years. For wireless communications  it is more appropriate to measure advances in 5 years and 10 years timeframe as a new generation wireless technology is developed every 10 year and a major upgrade on each generation follows 5 years afterwards as shown in Figure 1. Global mobile traffic already surpassed 1 Exabyte/ month mark in 2013 and is projected to grow 10 fold exceeding 10 Exabytes/ month within 5 years in 2018 [1]. With this trend  in 2028 global mobile traffic will cross the 1 Zetabyte/ month which is equivalent to 200 Gigabytes/month for 5 Billion users. Wi-Fi offload accounts for almost as much traffic as on mobile networks and also follows a similar growth trend with another Zetabyte/ month mobile traffic flowing over Wi-Fi networks by 2028."

Most research on projecting species range shifts under climate change has not been translated to informing priority management strategies on the ground. We develop a prioritization framework to assess strategies for managing threats to biodiversity under climate change and apply it to the management of invasive animal species across one-sixth of the Australian continent  the Lake Eyre Basin. We collected information from key stakeholders and experts on the impacts of invasive animals on 148 of the region's most threatened species and 11 potential strategies. Assisted by models of current distributions of threatened species and their projected distributions  experts estimated the cost  feasibility  and potential benefits of each strategy for improving the persistence of threatened species with and without climate change. We discover that the relative cost-effectiveness of invasive animal control strategies is robust to climate change  with the management of feral pigs being the highest priority for conserving threatened species overall. Complementary sets of strategies to protect as many threatened species as possible under limited budgets change when climate change is considered  with additional strategies required to avoid impending extinctions from the region. Overall  we find that the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness was relatively unaffected by including climate change into decision-making  even though the benefits of the strategies were lower. Future climate conditions and impacts on range shifts become most important to consider when designing comprehensive management plans for the control of invasive animals under limited budgets to maximize the number of threatened species that can be protected."

Spectroscopic analysis shows that this light is emitted by a cold and dense plasma and also that lines coming from the cathode plate material are present revealing a local cathodic sputtering effect. We examine the conditions for the levitation to occur and show that the levitation is essentially of thermal origin.

Research Methods and Procedures: We evaluated prospective data on 20 064 U.S men  46 to 81 years of age  who participated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Data on body weight  dietary factors  and lifestyle variables were obtained by validated questionnaires. We examined weight gain during 10 years of follow-up. Results: Overall  5857 men had a weight gain of 5 kg or greater during 10 years of follow-up. Breakfast consumption was inversely associated with the risk of 5-kg weight gain after adjustment for age [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]  0.72 to 0.82)]  and this association was independent of lifestyle and BMI at baseline [HR = 0.87 (95% CI  0.82 to 0.93)]. Fiber and nutrient intakes partially explained the association between breakfast consumption and weight gain. The inverse association between breakfast consumption and weight gain was more pronounced in men with a baseline BMI of 25 kg/m2 or lower [multivariate HR = 0.78 (95% CI  0.70 to 0.87)] than in men who were overweight at baseline [HR = 0.92 (95% CI  0.85 to 1.00)]. Furthermore  we observed that an increasing number of eating occasions in addition to three standard meals was associated with a higher risk of 5-kg weight gain [HR = 1.15 (95% CI  1.06 to 1.25  for ≥2 vs. 0 additional eating occasions)]. Discussion: These findings suggest that the consumption of breakfast may modestly contribute to the prevention of weight gain as compared with skipping breakfast in middle-aged and older men. Introduction: The prevalence of overweight and obesity has rapidly increased during recent decades and is associated with an increased burden of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer (1). The prevalence of people not consuming breakfast every day has increased over the last decades  in children  adolescents (2)  and adults (3). The consumption of breakfast has been postulated to be an important factor in preventing weight gain. Breakfast consumption could reduce total caloric intake during the day by consuming less food later in the day (4)  possibly as a result of more stable blood glucose levels in breakfast consumers as compared with breakfast non-consumers (5). Additionally  a higher frequency of meal consumption could have favorable effects on metabolic responses (6). The type of foods consumed at breakfast might contribute to a lower BMI by improving overall dietary intake (7)  particularly the amount of fiber (8  9). Several cross-sectional studies reported inverse associations between the consumption of breakfast and BMI (8  10  11  12). However  the possibility exists that the observed inverse cross-sectional association between the consumption of breakfast and BMI is caused by the skipping of breakfast in overweight subjects in an attempt to reduce total energy intake. Few prospective studies have been performed to examine the association between breakfast consumption and weight gain in children (13)  adolescents (14  15)  and adults (16  17). The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between breakfast consumption and weight gain in an adult male population over a 10-year period."

This study aimed to determine: (1) if changes in exercise frequency in young adulthood predict simultaneous changes in fruit/vegetable intake (transfer as co-occurrence); and (2) if exercise frequency affects future fruit/vegetable intake (transfer as carry-over). Methods: 6244 respondents of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 were followed at ages 18–22 (Time-1)  23–27 (Time-2)  and 27–31 (Time-3). Repeated measures analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple regression determined if the change in exercise frequency between Time-1 and Time-2 was associated with simultaneous and sequential changes in fruit/vegetable intake frequency  controlling for sex  race/ethnicity  education  income  body mass index  and baseline fruit/vegetable intake. Results: Only 9% continued exercising for 30 minutes more than 5 days/week  while 15% transitioned to adequate exercise and another 15% transitioned to inadequate exercise; for both fruits and vegetables  intake of once per day or more increased with age. Males were more likely to exercise adequately and females to consume fruits/vegetables adequately. Exercise frequency transition was linearly associated with concurrent fruit/vegetable intake during Time-1 and Time-2. The highest increase in mean fruit/vegetable intake occurred for participants who transitioned from inadequate to adequate exercise. A significant Time-2 exercise frequency effect on Time-3 fruit/vegetable intake emerged  after accounting for baseline intake. Increase in Time-2 exercise by one day/week resulted in increased Time-3 fruit and vegetable intakes by 0.17 and 0.13 times/week  respectively. Conclusion: Transfer effects  although usually discussed in interventions  may also be applicable to voluntary behavior change processes. Newly engaging in and continuing exercise behavior over time may establish exercise habits that facilitate improved fruit/vegetable consumption. Interventions that facilitate transferring resources across behaviors likely will enhance this effect."

In our current campaign we offer a nicotine-degrading enzyme from Pseudomonas putida  NicA2  a flavin-containing protein. To explore its potential  a kinetic evaluation of the enzyme was conducted  which included determination of Km  kcat  buffer/serum half-life  and thermostability. Additionally  the catabolism profile of NicA2 was elucidated to assess the potential toxicity of the nicotine-derived products. In characterizing the enzyme  a favorable biochemical profile of the enzyme was discovered  making NicA2 a prospective therapeutic candidate. This approach provides a new avenue for the field of nicotine addiction therapy."

Participants 199 293 men and 288 082 women aged 30 to 79 years at baseline after excluding participants with cancer  heart disease  and stroke at baseline. Main exposure measures Consumption frequency of spicy foods  self reported once at baseline. Main outcome measures Total and cause specific mortality. Results During 3 500 004 person years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median 7.2 years)  a total of 11 820 men and 8404 women died. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1  4.4  4.3  and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week  1 or 2  3 to 5  and 6 or 7 days a week  respectively. Spicy food consumption showed highly consistent inverse associations with total mortality among both men and women after adjustment for other known or potential risk factors. In the whole cohort  compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week  the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96)  0.86 (0.80 to 0.92)  and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2  3 to 5  and 6 or 7 days a week  respectively. Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week  those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality. The inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was stronger in those who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer  ischemic heart diseases  and respiratory diseases. Conclusion In this large prospective study  the habitual consumption of spicy foods was inversely associated with total and certain cause specific mortality  independent of other risk factors of death."

The custom scaffolds are deterministically fabricated via a microextrusion printing principle using 3D models  which are reverse engineered from patient anatomies by 3D scanning. The bifurcating pathways are augmented with 3D printed biomimetic physical cues (microgrooves) and path-specific biochemical cues (spatially controlled multicomponent gradients). In vitro studies reveal that 3D printed physical and biochemical cues provide axonal guidance and chemotractant/chemokinetic functionality. In vivo studies examining the regeneration of bifurcated injuries across a 10 mm complex nerve gap in rats showed that the 3D printed scaffolds achieved successful regeneration of complex nerve injuries  resulting in enhanced functional return of the regenerated nerve. This approach suggests the potential of 3D printing toward advancing tissue regeneration in terms of: (1) the customization of scaffold geometries to match inherent tissue anatomies; (2) the integration of biomanufacturing approaches with computational modeling for design  analysis  and optimization; and (3) the enhancement of device properties with spatially controlled physical and biochemical functionalities  all enabled by the same 3D printing process."

Its small size makes it bioavailable to thousands of species across nearly all trophic levels. Because of the difficulty of large-scale cleanup  environmental managers  scientists  and environmentalists have stressed that the best solution to microplastic pollution is source reduction. Recently  one source of microplastic has received much attention in the media and from policy makers: plastic microbeads. Microbeads are plastic fragments or beads ranging in size from roughly 5 μm to 1 mm. They are made from synthetic polymers including polyethylene  polylactic acid (PLA)  polypropylene  polystyrene  or polyethylene terephthalate. Microbeads are used in hundreds of products  often as abrasive scrubbers  including face washes  body washes  cosmetics  and cleaning supplies  and are used as a replacement for natural exfoliating materials  such as pumice  oatmeal  or walnut husks. Microbeads are designed to be discarded down the drain. Because of their small size  some microbeads are littered into the environment via final effluent or biosolids (sewage sludge) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)1−3 and have become one of the many types of microplastic debris reported in aquatic habitats. Microplastics enter aquatic habitats via several sources. How much of this contamination is caused by microbeads? We do not yet know. Because of the large volume in production and current end-of-life strategy  microbeads have the potential to be a source of many microplastic particles to aquatic habitats. One approach for estimating the contamination is to quantify microbeads in effluent from WWTPs. To provide an example of the potential for environmental contamination  we use the limited available information to estimate how many microbeads may be entering aquatic habitats from the United States alone."

Using long-lived smokers as a phenotype ( n = 90)—a group whose survival may signify innate resilience—we conducted a genome-wide association study comparing them to smokers at ages 52–69 ( n = 730). These results were used to conduct a functional interaction network and pathway analysis  to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that collectively related to smokers’ longevity. We identified a set of 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms (all of which had p <5×10 −3 in the genome-wide association study) that were located within genes making-up a functional interaction network. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were then used to create a weighted polygenic risk score that  using an independent validation sample of nonsmokers ( N = 6 447)  was found to be significantly associated with a 22% increase in the likelihood of being aged 90–99 ( n = 253) and an over threefold increase in the likelihood of being a centenarian ( n = 4)  compared with being at ages 52–79 ( n = 4 900). Additionally  the polygenic risk score was also associated with an 11% reduction in cancer prevalence over up to 18 years (odds ratio: 0.89  p = .011). Overall  using a unique phenotype and incorporating prior knowledge of biological networks  this study identified a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms that together appear to be important for human aging  stress resistance  cancer  and longevity."

Now researchers are finding clues that help explain how the substance works. Their conclusions suggest that one day it could come in a new  therapeutic form. Their study appears in ACS’ The Journal of Physical Chemistry B. About 10 years ago  researchers reported that capsaicin can kill prostate cancer cells in mice while leaving healthy cells unharmed. But translating that dose to humans would require them to eat a huge number of chili peppers per day. Figuring out how capsaicin works could help researchers transform it into an effective drug in the form of an injection or pill. Researchers have figured out that the molecule binds to a cell’s surface and affects the membrane  which surrounds and protects the cell. That finding prompted Ashok Kumar Mishra and Jitendriya Swain to try to gain a deeper understanding of capsaicin’s effects so it might be harnessed in the future for new medicines. The scientists were able to detect how the compound interacts with cell membranes by monitoring its natural fluorescence. The study showed that capsaicin lodges in the membranes near the surface. Add enough of it  and the capsaicin essentially causes the membranes to come apart. With additional research  this insight could help lead to novel tools against cancer or other conditions."

Patients on anticoagulant therapy such as heparin have diminished clotting potential and are at risk for hemorrhaging. Here we describe a self-assembling nanofibrous peptide hydrogel (termed SLac) that on its own can act as a physical barrier to blood loss. SLac was loaded with snake-venom derived Batroxobin (50 μg/mL) yielding a drug-loaded hydrogel (SB50). SB50 was potentiated to enhance clotting even in the presence of heparin. In vitro evaluation of fibrin and whole blood clotting helped identify appropriate concentrations for hemostasis in vivo. Batroxobin-loaded hydrogels rapidly (within 20s) stop bleeding in both normal and heparin-treated rats in a lateral liver incision model. Compared to standard of care  Gelfoam  and investigational hemostats such as Puramatrix  only SB50 showed rapid liver incision hemostasis post surgical application. This snake venom-loaded peptide hydrogel can be applied via syringe and conforms to the wound site resulting in hemostasis. This demonstrates a facile method for surgical hemostasis even in the presence of anticoagulant therapies."

Methods: A two-wave longitudinal design was used to examine the protective effect of positive sibling relationships on child adjustment for children experiencing stressful life events. Mothers reported on stressful life events and child adjustment. Older siblings assessed the quality of relationship between themselves and target children. Results: Sibling affection moderated the relationship between stressful life events and internalizing symptomatology but not the relationship between stressful life events and externalizing symptomatology. Notably  the protective effect of sibling affection was evident regardless of mother–child relationship quality.

Using an inclusive measure of sibling aggression  this study investigated  firstly  prevalence of sibling aggression and associations with family and household characteristics  and secondly  the relationship between sibling aggression and peer bullying. Participants were 4 237 adolescents from Wave 1 of Understanding Society. Four types of sibling aggression were measured: physical  verbal  stealing and teasing  and combined into composite measures of victimization and perpetration. Regression analysis identified associations with demographic characteristics  family and sibling composition  parent–child relationships and socioeconomic status and explored the link between sibling aggression and involvement in peer bullying. Using a broad definition  sibling aggression was found to be widespread  with 46% of all participants being victimized and 36% perpetrating aggression. Household and family characteristics  including a large family size  male siblings  and financial difficulties were associated with greater rates of sibling aggression. Parenting behavior showed the strongest relationship: harsh parenting increased the risk of sibling aggression while positive parenting protected against it. Sibling aggression was also homotypically related to involvement in peer bullying. Victimization by siblings significantly increased the odds of being a victim of peer bullying  and perpetrators of sibling aggression were more likely to be both peer bullies and bully-victims. Considering the adverse effects of sibling aggression on physical and mental health  the study provides pointers for efforts to reduce the risk of sibling aggression. Furthermore  the link with peer bullying suggests that school anti-bullying efforts should also take account of children's sibling relationships. Aggr.

Methods: The 101 participants included 27 recent light users of Ecstasy (one to four times in the last 3 months)  23 recent heavier Ecstasy users (five or more times) and 51 non-users. Rivermead paragraph recall provided an objective measure for immediate and delayed recall. The prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire provided a subjective index of memory deficits. Cortisol levels were taken from near-scalp 3-month hair samples. Results: Cortisol was significantly raised in recent heavy Ecstasy users compared with controls  whereas hair cortisol in light Ecstasy users was not raised. Both Ecstasy groups were significantly impaired on the Rivermead delayed word recall  and both groups reported significantly more retrospective and prospective memory problems. Stepwise regression confirmed that lifetime Ecstasy predicted the extent of these memory deficits. Conclusions: Recreational Ecstasy is associated with increased levels of the bio-energetic stress hormone cortisol and significant memory impairments. No significant relationship between cortisol and the cognitive deficits was observed. Ecstasy users did display evidence of a metacognitive deficit  with the strength of the correlations between objective and subjective memory performances being significantly lower in the Ecstasy users.

We studied the emergence of this loss of contact with reality based on current models of normal brain function. Working with clinical individuals experiencing early psychosis and nonclinical individuals with high levels of psychosis proneness  we show that their visual perception is characterized by a shift that favors prior knowledge over incoming sensory evidence. Given that these alterations in information processing are evident early on in psychosis and even in association with subtle perceptual changes indicating psychosis proneness  they may be important factors contributing to the emergence of severe mental illnesses. Abstract: Many neuropsychiatric illnesses are associated with psychosis  i.e.  hallucinations (perceptions in the absence of causative stimuli) and delusions (irrational  often bizarre beliefs). Current models of brain function view perception as a combination of two distinct sources of information: bottom-up sensory input and top-down influences from prior knowledge. This framework may explain hallucinations and delusions. Here  we characterized the balance between visual bottom-up and top-down processing in people with early psychosis (study 1) and in psychosis-prone  healthy individuals (study 2) to elucidate the mechanisms that might contribute to the emergence of psychotic experiences. Through a specialized mental-health service  we identified unmedicated individuals who experience early psychotic symptoms but fall below the threshold for a categorical diagnosis. We observed that  in early psychosis  there was a shift in information processing favoring prior knowledge over incoming sensory evidence. In the complementary study  we capitalized on subtle variations in perception and belief in the general population that exhibit graded similarity with psychotic experiences (schizotypy). We observed that the degree of psychosis proneness in healthy individuals  and  specifically  the presence of subtle perceptual alterations  is also associated with stronger reliance on prior knowledge. Although  in the current experimental studies  this shift conferred a performance benefit  under most natural viewing situations  it may provoke anomalous perceptual experiences. Overall  we show that early psychosis and psychosis proneness both entail a basic shift in visual information processing  favoring prior knowledge over incoming sensory evidence. The studies provide complementary insights to a mechanism by which psychotic symptoms may emerge."

It remains unclear whether cancer survivors adhere to existing dietary guidelines and whether survivors' diets differ from those of individuals without cancer over the long term. METHODS: The authors evaluated dietary intake and quality in 1533 adult cancer survivors who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2010 compared with dietary intake and quality in 3075 individuals who had no history of cancer and were matched to the cancer survivors by age  sex  and race/ethnicity. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls. The 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) was used to evaluate diet quality. RESULTS The mean±standard deviation HEI-2010 total score was 47.2±0.5 in the cancer survivors and 48.3±0.4 in the noncancer group (P=.03). Compared with the noncancer group  cancer survivors had a significantly lower score for empty calories (13.6 vs 14.4; P=.001)  which corresponded to worse adherence to dietary intake of calories from solid fats  alcohol  and added sugars. Cancer survivors also had significantly lower dietary intake of fiber than the noncancer group (15.0 vs 15.9 g per day; P=.02). In relation to recommended intake  survivors' mean dietary intake of vitamin D  vitamin E  potassium  fiber  and calcium was 31%  47%  55%  60%  and 73%  respectively; whereas their mean dietary intake of saturated fat and sodium was 112% and 133%  respectively  of the recommended intake. CONCLUSIONS Cancer survivors had poor adherence to the US Department of Agriculture 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans  and their intake patterns were worse than those in the general population for empty calories and fiber."

Beverages and snack foods purchased from coffee chains may contribute excess energy and nutrients to the diet if they are consumed in addition to usual meals. The present study investigated the energy  saturated fat and sugar content of beverages and sweet snacks from major coffee chains and compared the nutrient content to daily intake (DI) reference values for adults. Methods: Nutrition information per serve was sourced from the Australian websites of five coffee chains with the largest number of outlets in New South Wales and compared to DI reference values for adults for energy  saturated fat and sugars. Energy per serve was compared to 600kJ  the Australian Dietary Guidelines recommendation for one serve of a discretionary food. Results: Eighty-four per cent (n=238) of sweet snacks and 65% (n=79) of cold beverages provided more than two equivalent serves (1200kJ) of a discretionary food. Sixteen (13%) cold beverages and 47 (16%) sweet snacks provided over 50% DI of saturated fat. Sixty-six (54%) cold beverages and 47 (16%) sweet snacks had more than half the DI of sugars. Conclusions Food and beverage items from coffee chains may contribute to excess intake of energy and other nutrients of public health concern if consumed in addition to meals.

Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier forever changed the practice and concepts of chemistry by forging a new series of laboratory analyses that would bring order to the chaotic centuries of Greek philosophy and medieval alchemy. Lavoisier’s work in framing the principles of modern chemistry led future generations to regard him as a founder of the science.Contents Beliefs in Chemistry at Lavoisier’s Time Combustion and the Attack on Phlogiston A New Chemistry Emerges The Life of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794) Further Reading Landmark Designation and Acknowledgments Cite this Page “The Chemical Revolution” commemorative booklet “The Chemical Revolution” commemorative booklet produced by the National Historic Chemical Landmarks program of the American Chemical Society in 1999 (PDF). Beliefs in Chemistry at Lavoisier’s Time When the 17-year-old Lavoisier left Mazarin College in Paris in 1761  chemistry hardly could be called a true science. Unlike physics  which had come of age through the work of Isaac Newton a century earlier  chemistry was still mired in the legacy of the Greek philosophers. The four elements of Aristotle — earth  air  fire  and water — had been slowly modified by the medieval alchemists  who added their own arcane language and symbolism. Thrown into this mix was the concept of phlogiston. Developed by the German scientist Georg Ernst Stahl early in the 18th century  phlogiston was a dominant chemical concept of the time because it seemed to explain so much in a simple fashion. Stahl believed that every combustible substance contained a universal component of fire  which he named phlogiston  from the Greek word for inflammable. Because a combustible substance such as charcoal lost weight when it burned  Stahl reasoned that this change was due to the loss of its phlogiston component to the air. It followed that the less residue a substance left after burning  the greater its phlogiston content. Turning from organic substances to metals  Stahl knew that a metal calx (known today as an oxide) heated with charcoal formed the original metal. He proposed that the phlogiston of the charcoal had united with the calx. Therefore  metals  which were thought to contain phlogiston  were also classified as combustibles. The difficulty with this scheme was the reverse reaction. When metals were strongly heated in air  the resulting calx weighed more than the original metal  not less  as would be expected if the lead had lost the phlogiston component. This inconsistency caused some phlogistonists to suggest that phlogiston might even have a negative weight. Lavoisier was introduced to phlogiston by Guillaume Franåois Rouelle  whose lectures he attended while pursuing a law degree. By 1772  having abandoned law to pursue a career in science  Lavoisier turned his curiosity to the study of combustion."

This article reviews research in fields outside mainstream psychology concerned with the social and psychological factors that influence how people experience and use music in their daily lives. The research in this area shows that music can have considerable effects on cognition  emotion  and behavior. It also indicates that people use music to serve various functions  from emotion regulation to self-expression to social bonding.

Here  we have revealed that an information-rich latent fingerprint has not been used to its full potential. In our approach  the content present in the sweat left behind—namely the amino acids—can be used to determine physical such as gender of the originator. As a result  we were able to focus on the biochemical content in the fingerprint using a biocatalytic assay  coupled with a specially designed extraction protocol  for determining gender rather than focusing solely on the physical image."

On the scale of everyday life  it is understandable how something as personally aversive as loneliness could be regarded as a blight on human existence. However  evolutionary time and evolutionary forces operate at such a different scale of organization than we experience in everyday life that personal experience is not sufficient to understand the role of loneliness in human existence. Research over the past decade suggests a very different view of loneliness than suggested by personal experience  one in which loneliness serves a variety of adaptive functions in specific habitats. We review evidence on the heritability of loneliness and outline an evolutionary theory of loneliness  with an emphasis on its potential adaptive value in an evolutionary timescale."

Since then  heat-sensing devices have found many real-word applications but have remained relatively expensive and rigid. But a new development featuring graphene  reported in ACS’ journal Nano Letters  could lead to a flexible  transparent and low-cost infrared vision system. The concept of humans — or aliens — having the power to see in the infrared to help fight enemies in the dark has been around for decades. Technology has allowed real-life military  police  firefighters and others to do their jobs successfully at night and in smoky conditions. It also helps manufacturers and building inspectors identify overheating equipment or circuits. But currently  many of these systems require cryogenic cooling to filter out background radiation  or “noise ” and create a reliable image. This approach  however  complicates the design of these imaging devices  and adds to the cost and the unit’s bulkiness. Tomás Palacios  Pablo Jarillo-Herrero and colleagues wanted to find a more practical solution. The researchers integrated graphene with silicon microelectromechanical systems (known as MEMS) to make their device. Testing showed it could be used to detect a person’s heat signature at room temperature without cryogenic cooling. In the future  advances could make the device even more versatile. The researchers say that a thermal sensor could be based on a single layer of graphene  which would make it transparent and flexible. Also  manufacturing could be simplified  which would bring costs down."

By integrating graphene based photothermo-electric detectors with micromachined silicon nitride membranes  we are able to achieve room temperature responsivities on the order of ∼7–9 V/W (at λ = 10.6 μm)  with a time constant of ∼23 ms. The large responsivities  due to the combination of thermal isolation and broadband infrared absorption from the underlying SiN membrane  have enabled detection as well as stand-off imaging of an incoherent blackbody target (300–500 K). By comparing the fundamental achievable performance of these graphene-based thermopiles with standard thermocouple materials  we extrapolate that graphene’s high carrier mobility can enable improved performances with respect to two main figures of merit for infrared detectors: detectivity (>8 × 108 cm Hz1/2 W–1) and noise equivalent temperature difference (<100 mK). Furthermore  even average graphene carrier mobility (<1000 cm2 V–1 s–1) is still sufficient to detect the emitted thermal radiation from a human target."

Ejaculation is used as a synonym for the external ejection of semen  but it comprises two phases: emission and expulsion. As semen collects in the prostatic urethra  the rapid preorgasmic distension of the urethral bulb is pathognomonic of impeding orgasm  and the man experiences a sensation that ejaculation is inevitable (in women  emission is the only phase of orgasm). The semen is propelled along the penile urethra mainly by the bulbocavernosus muscle. With Kegel exercises  it is possible to train the perineal muscles. Immediately after the expulsion phase the male enters a refractory period  a recovery time during which further orgasm or ejaculation is physiologically impossible. Age affects the recovery time: as a man grows older  the refractory period increases. Sexual medicine experts consider premature ejaculation only in the case of vaginal intercourse  but vaginal orgasm has no scientific basis  so the duration of intercourse is not important for a woman's orgasm. The key to female orgasm are the female erectile organs; vaginal orgasm  G-spot  G-spot amplification  clitoral bulbs  clitoris-urethra-vaginal complex  internal clitoris and female ejaculation are terms without scientific basis. Female sexual dysfunctions are popular because they are based on something that does not exist  i.e. the vaginal orgasm. The physiology of ejaculation and orgasm is not impaired in premature ejaculation: it is not a disease  and non-coital sexual acts after male ejaculation can be used to produce orgasm in women. Teenagers and men can understand their sexual responses by masturbation and learn ejaculatory control with the stop–start method and the squeeze technique. Premature ejaculation must not be classified as a male sexual dysfunction. It has become the center of a multimillion dollar business: is premature ejaculation—and female sexual dysfunction—an illness constructed by sexual medicine experts under the influence of drug companies?

By aligning the structures’ bands  we noted that structures with Sr  Ca  B  and Al have potential for usage in water splitting  and anhydrous B-birnessite is predicted to have a suitable direct band gap for light capturing. Furthermore  we also demonstrate how the effects of cations in the bulk differ from the behavior on single layer surfaces. More specifically  we show that an indirect to direct band transition is observed when we separate the bulk into a single layer oxide. This study shows a new strategy for tuning the band gap of layered materials to capture light which may couple to its intrinsic water-splitting catalytic properties  thus resembling photosynthesis."

Developing CR mimetics  compounds that reproduce the longevity benefits of CR without its side effects  is of widespread interest.

Eleven statistically significant compounds were predicted as CR mimetics using this bioinformatics approach. We then tested rapamycin  allantoin  trichostatin A  LY-294002 and geldanamycin in Caenorhabditis elegans. An increase in lifespan and healthspan was observed for all drugs except geldanamycin when fed to wild-type worms  but no lifespan effects were observed in eat-2 mutant worms  a genetic model of CR  suggesting that life-extending effects may be acting via CR-related mechanisms. We also treated daf-16 worms with rapamycin  allantoin or trichostatin A  and a lifespan extension was observed  suggesting that these drugs act via DAF-16-independent mechanisms  as would be expected from CR mimetics. Supporting this idea  an analysis of predictive targets of the drugs extending lifespan indicates various genes within CR and longevity networks. We also assessed the transcriptional profile of worms treated with either rapamycin or allantoin and found that both drugs use several specific pathways that do not overlap  indicating different modes of action for each compound.

However  salt can be easily removed by rain or automobiles and requires frequent application on roads. Besides this economic consideration  anti-icing agents compromise the mechanical properties of asphalt and have a negative impact on living organisms and the environment when used in large amounts. Incorporation of hydrophilic salts into bitumen  a hydrophobic asphalt binder  and controlled release of specific molecules from this hydrophobic medium can provide an effective solution for reducing ice formation on pavements. Bitumen has previously been modified by various polymers  including styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) for improved strength and thermomechanical properties. However  an anti-icing function was not considered in those previous designs. In a previous study  we developed a functional polymer composite consisting of potassium formate (HCOOK) salt pockets dissolved in a hydrophilic gel medium and dispersed in a hydrophobic SBS polymer matrix. Here  we developed an innovative method to obtain polymer composite-modified bitumen and investigated further the anti-icing properties of the functional bitumen. We improved incorporation of this polymer composite into bitumen and demonstrated proper distribution of the composite within bitumen through morphological and rheological analysis. We characterized the anti-icing properties of modified bitumen surfaces and demonstrated significant increases in freezing delay of composite-modified bitumen compared to base bitumen in a temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber. In addition  we characterized the release of HCOOK salt from polymer composite-modified bitumen and observed salt release within the range of 1.07–10.8% (w/w) in 67 days  depending on the composite content. The results demonstrate the potential of this polymer composite-modified bitumen for anti-icing functionality and for industrially relevant applications."

They are more closely related to vampires infected with the contagious bacterium Bacillus vampiris.2 Here  I review zombie biology and epidemiology. History Descriptions of zombies date back to the 1500s.3 Haitian zombies are probably the best described  often thought to be controlled by practitioners of voodoo.4 They may have been created via a neurotoxin  typically described as tetrodotoxin  which puts the victim in a sleep-like state.5 These voodoo or chemical zombies seem to be unrelated to the current wave of epidemics  which began with the first documented outbreak in 1968 (fig 1⇓).6 The modern outbreaks are thought to be infectious in aetiology and transmissible by bite.

This is the first self-sufficient system powered by a wearable energy generator based on microbial fuel cell technology. The scientific paper  'Self-sufficient Wireless Transmitter Powered by Foot-pumped Urine Operating Wearable MFC' is published in Bioinspiration and Biomimetics. The paper describes a lab-based experiment led by Professor Ioannis Ieropoulos  of the Bristol BioEnergy Centre at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol). The Bristol BioEnergy Centre is based in Bristol Robotics Laboratory  a collaborative partnership between the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) and the University of Bristol. Soft MFCs embedded within a pair of socks was supplied with fresh urine  circulated by the human operator walking. Normally  continuous-flow MFCs would rely on a mains powered pump to circulate the urine over the microbial fuel cells  but this experiment relied solely on human activity. The manual pump was based on a simple fish circulatory system and the action of walking caused the urine to pass over the MFCs and generate energy. Soft tubes  placed under the heels  ensured frequent fluid push-pull by walking. The wearable MFC system successfully ran a wireless transmission board  which was able to send a message every two minutes to the PC-controlled receiver module. Professor Ieropoulos says  \"Having already powered a mobile phone with MFCs using urine as fuel  we wanted to see if we could replicate this success in wearable technology. We also wanted the system to be entirely self-sufficient  running only on human power - using urine as fuel and the action of the foot as the pump.\" \"This work opens up possibilities of using waste for powering portable and wearable electronics. For example  recent research shows it should be possible to develop a system based on wearable MFC technology to transmit a person's coordinates in an emergency situation. At the same time this would indicate proof of life since the device will only work if the operator's urine fuels the MFCs.\" Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) use bacteria to generate electricity from waste fluids. They tap into the biochemical energy used for microbial growth and convert it directly into electricity. This technology can use any form of organic waste and turn it into useful energy without relying on fossil fuels  making this a valuable green technology."

Based on recent survey data  it is shown that the technology increases total factor productivity by 10% on average  with cost savings being somewhat more pronounced for smaller than for larger farms. The reduction in use of toxic herbicides and of tillage operations entails positive environmental repercussions. Aggregate welfare effects are computed over the 1996–2001 period with a three-region  partial equilibrium model  comprising Argentina  the United States  and the rest of the world. In 2001  RR soybeans created more than US$1.2 billion of economic surplus at the global level. The largest share went to consumers (53%)  followed by seed and biotechnology firms (34%)  and agricultural producers (13%). Due to comparatively weak intellectual property protection  and thus only small technology mark-ups in seed prices and widespread adoption  Argentine soybean growers receive 90% of the benefits in that country. This demonstrates that farmers in developing countries can gain considerably when they obtain access to suitable foreign innovations through technology spill-overs."

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses three complementary approaches. Promotion policies and guidelines are examined using content analysis of documents from all Australian universities. A sample of 17 universities was selected for interviews with key gatekeepers to examine promotions practice. Data on promotions by level and gender were analysed for 16 of these universities 2000‐2002.Findings The analysis of promotions policies and guidelines established a range of practice. Policies supporting women's participation and success in promotions included explicit consideration of part‐time and non‐traditional careers  clear equity statements  and gender representation on promotions committees. Interviews emphasised the importance of support for and identification of female candidates  and the need for the establishment of institution‐wide and performance targets for senior managers. Implicitly  most interviewees accepted the premise that women experienced barriers in the promotion process  including reticence in applying and stereotypically gendered notions of merit. However  the analysis of promotions data showed a more encouraging picture. Application rates and success rates for women are similar to men's and  at professorial level  slightly higher. Nonetheless women remain under‐represented at senior levels  comprising only 16 per cent of the professoriate.

We can create diamond in the form of nanodiamond (size range <100 nm) and microdiamond (>100 nm). Nanosecond laser pulses are used to melt amorphous diamondlike carbon and create a highly undercooled state  from which various forms of diamond can be formed upon cooling. The quenching from the super undercooled state results in nucleation of nanodiamond. It is found that microdiamonds grow out of highly undercooled state of carbon  with nanodiamond acting as seed crystals.The carbon to diamond conversion at ambient pressures and lower temperatures is scientifically challenging with immense technological significance.1–3 Conversion of carbon  one of the most abundant materials in the Earth’s crust  into most precious material diamond has been a cherished goal of the scientists all over the world for the longest time. Diamond is one of the most desirable materials with many applications ranging from abrasives  protective coatings  and biomedical applications to superior diamond electronics  photonics  and display devices. Conventional bulk processing involves high pressures and temperatures 1 and chemical vapor deposition for thin films requires high temperatures in the presence of hydrogen.4 These requirements lead to low production volumes and high costs. Conversion of SiC into nanodiamond has been reported at temperatures ∼1000°C under flowing hydrogen and chlorine gases at ambient pressures.5 Here  we show that a direct conversion of carbon into diamond can occur in air at ambient temperatures and pressures without any need for catalysts and hydrogen to stabilize sp3 diamond bonding."

The methodology enables the large-scale fabrication of lateral heterostructures  which offers tremendous potential for its application in integrated circuits. As the fundamental limit of Moore’s law is approaching  the global semiconductor industry is intensively looking for applications beyond CMOS electronics. [1] The atomically thin and ultra-flexible nature of two-dimensional (2D) materials (such as graphene  hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)) offer a competitive solution not only to push the forefront of semiconductor technology further  towards or perhaps beyond the Moore’s law  but also to potentially realize a vision of ubiquitous electronics and optoelectronics in the near 2 future. [2 3] Hybrid structures between 2D materials are essential building blocks with multi-functionality and broader capacity for nanoscale modern electronics and optoelectronics. [4–10] The stacking of van der Waals heterostructures in the vertical direction can be accomplished by either mechanical transfer or hetero-epitaxy  [4–6 8 9] whereas atomic stitching of 2D materials in the horizontal direction through conventional nanofabrication technology has proven to be far more challenging  mainly because of the lack of a selective etching method for each specific 2D material. Precise spatial control and self-limiting processes are highly desired to design and prepare lateral heterostructures. Researchers have attempted to build lateral heterostructures between materials with similar lattice structures and small lattice mismatch  such as graphene-hBN  and TMD-TMD lateral heterostructures. [4 10–16] However  parallel connection between two atomically layers with significant crystallographic dissimilarity  such as graphene-TMD or hBN-TMD lateral heterostructures  has never been achieved. Furthermore  most of these methods are not suitable for large-scale production."

In the paper published in ACS Photonics the researchers have demonstrated how to efficiently cool optoelectronic chips using industry-standard heatsinks in spite of high heat generation in active plasmonic components. The speed of multicore and manycore microprocessors  which are already used in high-performance computer systems  depends not so much on the speed of an individual core  but rather on the time it takes for data to be transferred between the cores. The electrical copper interconnects used in microprocessors today are fundamentally limited in bandwidth  and they cannot be used to maintain the continuing growth of the processor performance.

This isocratic method was developed from  and is comparable with  a gradient elution method and resulted in no loss of sensitivity or reduction in chromatographic peak shape. Isocratic elution allows for significantly shorter run times (6 min)  eliminates the requirement for column equilibration periods and  thus  has the advantage of facilitating a high-throughput analysis which is particularly important for regulatory testing laboratories. In excess of two hundred injections are possible  with this new isocratic methodology  within a 24-h period which is more than 50% improvement on all previously published methodologies. Good linear calibrations were obtained for all 10 PAs and four PA N-oxides (PANOs) in spiked honey samples (3.57–357.14 µg l−1; R2 ≥ 0.9987). Acceptable inter-day repeatability was achieved for the target analytes in honey with % RSD values (n = 4) less than 7.4%. Limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ) were achieved with spiked PAs and PANOs samples; giving an average LOD of 1.6 µg kg−1 and LOQ of 5.4 µg kg−1. This method was successfully applied to Australian and New Zealand honey samples sourced from supermarkets in Australia. Analysis showed that 41 of the 59 honey samples were contaminated by PAs with the mean total sum of PAs being 153 µg kg−1.

The Q-carbon is formed as result of quenching from super undercooled state by using high-power nanosecond laser pulses. We discuss the equilibrium phase diagram (P vs. T) of carbon and show that by rapid quenching kinetics can shift thermodynamic graphite/diamond/liquid carbon triple point from 5000 K/12 GPa to super undercooled carbon at atmospheric pressure in air. It is shown that nanosecond laser heating of diamond-like amorphous carbon on sapphire  glass  and polymer substrates can be confined to melt carbon in a super undercooled state. By quenching the carbon from the super undercooled state  we have created a new state of carbon (Q-carbon) from which nanodiamond  microdiamond  microneedles  and single-crystal thin films are formed depending upon the nucleation and growth times allowed for diamond formation. The Q-carbon quenched from liquid is a new state of solid carbon with a higher mass density than amorphous carbon and a mixture of mostly fourfold sp3 (75%–85%) with the rest being threefold sp2 bonded carbon (with distinct entropy). It is expected to have new and improved mechanical hardness  electrical conductivity  chemical  and physical properties  including room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) and enhanced field emission. Here we present interesting results on RTFM  enhanced electrical conductivity and surface potential of Q-carbon to emphasize its unique properties. The Q-carbon exhibits robust bulk ferromagnetism with estimated Curie temperature of about 500 K and saturation magnetization value of 20 emu g−1. From the Q-carbon  diamond phase is nucleated and a variety of micro- and nanostructures and large-area single-crystal diamond sheets are grown by allowing growth times as needed. Subsequent laser pulses can be used to grow nanodiamond into microdiamond and nucleate other nanostructures of diamond on the top of existing microdiamond and create novel nanostructured materials. The microstructural details provide insights into the mechanism of formation of nanodiamond  microdiamond  nanoneedles  microneedles  and single-crystal thin films. This process allows carbon-to-diamond conversion and formation of useful nanostructures and microstructures at ambient temperatures in air at atmospheric pressure on practical and heat-sensitive substrates in a controlled way without need for any catalysts and hydrogen to stabilize sp3 bonding for diamond formation."

        "text": "Cocaine is one of the most abused drugs in modern society  with overdoses that are frequently lethal. Molecular mechanisms underlying its toxic actions have been obscure. The present study demonstrates that cocaine’s cellular toxicity involves a signaling cascade that utilizes the gasotransmitter nitric oxide  which leads to autophagy  a cellular modification that can cause cell death. Thus  manipulations that impair nitric oxide signaling and autophagy diminish cytotoxic actions of cocaine. By contrast  alterations of apoptosis and other nonautophagic modes of cell death are ineffective. Therapies directed toward the autophagic process may be beneficial in treating cocaine neurotoxicity. Abstract: Cocaine exerts its behavioral stimulant effects by facilitating synaptic actions of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. It is also neurotoxic and broadly cytotoxic  leading to overdose deaths. We demonstrate that the cytotoxic actions of cocaine reflect selective enhancement of autophagy  a process that physiologically degrades metabolites and cellular organelles  and that uncontrolled autophagy can also lead to cell death. In brain cultures  cocaine markedly increases levels of LC3-II and depletes p62  both actions characteristic of autophagy. By contrast  cocaine fails to stimulate cell death processes reflecting parthanatos  monitored by cleavage of poly(ADP ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1)  or necroptosis  assessed by levels of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy protects neurons against cocaine-induced cell death. On the other hand  inhibition of parthanatos  necroptosis  or apoptosis did not change cocaine cytotoxicity. Depletion of ATG5 or beclin-1  major mediators of autophagy  prevents cocaine-induced cell death. By contrast  depleting caspase-3  whose cleavage reflects apoptosis  fails to alter cocaine cytotoxicity  and cocaine does not alter caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover  depleting PARP-1 or RIPK1  key mediators of parthanatos and necroptosis  respectively  did not prevent cocaine-induced cell death. Autophagic actions of cocaine are mediated by the nitric oxide-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signaling pathway. Thus  cocaine-associated autophagy is abolished by depleting GAPDH via shRNA; by the drug CGP3466B  which prevents GAPDH nitrosylation; and by mutating cysteine-150 of GAPDH  its site of nitrosylation. Treatments that selectively influence cocaine-associated autophagy may afford therapeutic benefit."

To address the limited structural stability but use the potential of the protein threads as a backbone in fiber enforced materials  we generated composite structures of hagfish slime with biopolymers.

Eligibility criteria Three types of studies were eligible for the umbrella review: systematic reviews and meta-analyses that examined observational associations between circulating vitamin D concentrations and any clinical outcome; and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials assessing supplementation with vitamin D or active compounds (both established and newer compounds of vitamin D). Results 107 systematic literature reviews and 74 meta-analyses of observational studies of plasma vitamin D concentrations and 87 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation were identified. The relation between vitamin D and 137 outcomes has been explored  covering a wide range of skeletal  malignant  cardiovascular  autoimmune  infectious  metabolic  and other diseases. Ten outcomes were examined by both meta-analyses of observational studies and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials  but the direction of the effect and level of statistical significance was concordant only for birth weight (maternal vitamin D status or supplementation).

Methods Two studies were undertaken with 12 subjects. Study 1 investigated the effect of the HFD on skeletal muscle substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Study 2 assessed the metabolic and transcriptional responses in skeletal muscle to the transition from a fasted to fed state using a high-fat meal challenge before and after 5 days of the HFD. Results Study 1 showed no effect of a HFD on skeletal muscle metabolism or insulin sensitivity in fasting samples. Study 2 showed that a HFD elicits significant increases in fasting serum endotoxin and disrupts the normal postprandial excursions of serum endotoxin  as well as metabolic and transcriptional responses in skeletal muscle. These effects after 5 days of the HFD were accompanied by an altered fasting and postprandial response in the ratio of phosphorylated- to total-p38 protein. These changes all occurred in the absence of alterations in insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for early biological adaptations to high-fat feeding that proceed and possibly lead to insulin resistance."

Using the new EXIOBASE 2.2 multiregional input-output database  which describes the world economy at the detail of 43 countries  five rest-of-the-world regions  and 200 product sectors  we are able to trace the origin of the products consumed by households and represent global supply chains for 2007. We highlight the importance of environmental pressure arising from households with their consumption contributing to more than 60% of global GHG emissions and between 50% and 80% of total land  material  and water use. The footprints are unevenly distributed across regions  with wealthier countries generating the most significant impacts per capita. Elasticities suggest a robust and significant relationship between households’ expenditure and their environmental impacts  driven by a rising demand of nonprimary consumption items. Mobility  shelter  and food are the most important consumption categories across the environmental footprints. Globally  food accounts for 48% and 70% of household impacts on land and water resources  respectively  with consumption of meat  dairy  and processed food rising fast with income. Shelter and mobility stand out with high carbon and material intensity  whereas the significance of services for footprints relates to the large amount of household expenditure associated with them."

One hundred and sixty posts from a popular question and answer community website were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach  to examine the phenomenology of inner reading voices (IRVs). Results indicated that many individuals report routinely experiencing IRVs  which often have the auditory qualities of overt speech  such as recognizable identity  gender  pitch  loudness and emotional tone. IRVs were sometimes identified as the readers’ own voices  and sometimes as the voices of other people. Some individuals reported that IRVs were continuous with audible thoughts. Both controllable and uncontrollable IRVs were reported. IRVs may provide evidence for individual variation in imagery vividness and support for inner speech accounts of AVHs. IRVs may be a useful model for studying AVHs in the non-clinical population and need further investigation."

It has also been largely assumed that when one joins two bulk materials  interfacial phonon transport can be described in terms of the modes that exist in each material separately. However  a new formalism for calculating the modal contributions to thermal interface conductance with full inclusion of anharmonicity has been recently developed  which now offers a means for checking the validity of this assumption. Here  we examine the assumption of using the bulk materials' modes to describe the interfacial transport. The results indicate that when two materials are joined  a new set of vibrational modes are required to correctly describe the transport. As the modes are analyzed  certain classifications emerge and some of the most important modes are localized at the interface and can exhibit large conductance contributions that cannot be explained by the current physical picture based on transmission probability."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (LI-ESWT) can be used as a treatment for men with erectile dysfunction of organic origin. Materials and methods. This prospective  randomized  blinded  placebo-controlled study included 112 men unable to have intercourse either with or without medication. Erectile dysfunction was assessed at screening and 5  12 and 24 weeks after treatment. Assessment was performed by interview and using the Erection Hardness Scale (EHS) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaire. The men were randomly assigned either to LI-ESWT (n = 51  active group) or placebo (n = 54  placebo group). They received five treatments over 5 weeks. Both the participants and the doctors were blinded to the treatment. After 10 weeks  the placebo group received active treatment (active placebo group). Results. Twenty-nine men (57%  active group) were able to obtain an erection after treatment and to have sexual intercourse without the use of medication. In the placebo group  only five men (9%) showed similar results (p = 0.0001). The EHS after 5 weeks showed that men in the active group experienced a significant improvement in their erectile dysfunction  but no significant result was found with the use of the IIEF – Erectile Function domain. Conclusions. This placebo-controlled study over 5 weeks shows that 57% of the men who suffered from erectile dysfunction had an effect from LI-ESWT. After 24 weeks  seven (19%  active group) and nine (23%  active placebo group) men were still able to have intercourse without medication. This study shows a possible cure in some patients  but more research  longer follow-up in the placebo group and an international multicentre randomized study are needed."

As a first step toward doing so  we conducted three studies to assess whether concerns with mortality play a role in these phenomena. Based on terror management theory and research  we hypothesized that reminders of death would increase people's desire for fame and admiration of celebrities. In Study 1  mortality salience led participants to report greater desire for fame. In Study 2  mortality salience produced greater interest in having a star in the galaxy named after oneself. In Study 3  mortality salience increased liking for abstract art when it was attributed to a celebrity. These findings suggest that the appeal of fame is based in part on the desire for symbolic continuance beyond death. Discussion focused on the implications of these findings and remaining issues."

While electronics research already explores atomic scales devices  photonics research still deals with devices at the micrometer scale. Here we demonstrate that photonic scaling  similar to electronics  is only limited by the atom. More precisely  we introduce an electrically controlled plasmonic switch operating at the atomic scale. The switch allows for fast and reproducible switching by means of the relocation of an individual or  at most  a few atoms in a plasmonic cavity. Depending on the location of the atom either of two distinct plasmonic cavity resonance states are supported. Experimental results show reversible digital optical switching with an extinction ratio of 9.2 dB and operation at room temperature up to MHz with femtojoule (fJ) power consumption for a single switch operation. This demonstration of an integrated quantum device allowing to control photons at the atomic level opens intriguing perspectives for a fully integrated and highly scalable chip platform  a platform where optics  electronics  and memory may be controlled at the single-atom level."

Adiabatic expansion in divergent flow in advance of the L2 pressure minimum cools the air and reduces its saturation vapor pressure  thereby increasing the rate of condensation in saturated air parcels and causing the relative humidity (RH) of unsaturated parcels to rise. Here we detect a statistically significant L2 signature in precipitation rate (P) in a 15 year  eight times daily  global precipitation data set acquired in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. Consistent with tidal theory and with the notion that L2 modulates P mainly by perturbing RH  P varies out of phase with pressure  and it increases at a rate of about 10% per 1% increase in RH. These measurements thus provide a measure of the sensitivity of P to planetary-scale changes in RH. Analysis of solar semidiurnal (S2) tidal statistics yields similar results."

The environment affects DNA methylation  with potentially long-lasting effects on gene expression and disease. This study examined whether DNA methylation could underlie the association between season of birth and allergy. Methods: In a subset of 18-year-old participants from the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort (n = 367)  the risks of birth season on allergic outcomes were estimated. Whole blood epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured  and season-associated CpGs detected using a training-and-testing-based technique. Validation method examined the 8-year-old Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) cohort. The relationships between DNA methylation  season of birth and allergy were examined. CpGs were analysed in IoW third-generation cohort newborns. Results: Autumn birth increased risk of eczema  relative to spring birth. Methylation at 92 CpGs showed association with season of birth in the epigenome-wide association study. In validation  significantly more CpGs had the same directionality than expected by chance  and four were statistically significant. Season-associated methylation was enriched among networks relating to development  the cell cycle and apoptosis. Twenty CpGs were nominally associated with allergic outcomes. Two CpGs were marginally on the causal pathway to allergy. Season-associated methylation was largely absent in newborns  suggesting it arises post-natally. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that DNA methylation in adulthood is associated with season of birth  supporting the hypothesis that DNA methylation could mechanistically underlie the effect of season of birth on allergy  although other mechanisms are also likely to be involved."

The concentration found is very high and not to be explained merely by contamination. The metal found in these fragments deeply modifies our knowledge of Greek and Latin writing in antiquity. Moreover  these concentration values allow the optimization of future computed tomography experiments on still-unrolled Herculaneum scrolls to enable the recovery of texts in the only surviving ancient Greco-Roman library. The possibility of using additional material to trace down ruled lines guiding the scribes' writing along straight lines is also addressed. We demonstrate that no additional material was used for this goal. Abstract: Writing on paper is essential to civilization  as Pliny the Elder remarks in his Natural History  when he describes the various types of papyri  the method of manufacturing them  and all that concerns writing materials in the mid-first century AD. For this reason  a rigorous scientific study of writing is of fundamental importance for the historical understanding of ancient societies. We show that metallic ink was used several centuries earlier than previously thought. In particular  we found strong evidence that lead was intentionally used in the ink of Herculaneum papyri and discuss the possible existence of ruled lines traced on the papyrus texture. In addition  the metallic concentrations found in these fragments deliver important information in view of optimizing future computed tomography (CT) experiments on still-unrolled Herculaneum scrolls to improve the readability of texts in the only surviving ancient Greco-Roman library."

Four corotating interaction regions (CIRs)  where the first event has possibly merged with a coronal mass ejection  are traced from Earth via Mars (using Mars Express and Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission) to comet 67P from October to December 2014. When the comet is 3.1–2.7 AU from the Sun and the neutral outgassing rate ∼1025–1026 s−1  the CIRs significantly influence the cometary plasma environment at altitudes down to 10–30 km. The ionospheric low-energy (∼5 eV) plasma density increases significantly in all events  by a factor of >2 in events 1 and 2 but less in events 3 and 4. The spacecraft potential drops below −20 V upon impact when the flux of electrons increases. The increased density is likely caused by compression of the plasma environment  increased particle impact ionization  and possibly charge exchange processes and acceleration of mass-loaded plasma back to the comet ionosphere. During all events  the fluxes of suprathermal (∼10–100 eV) electrons increase significantly  suggesting that the heating mechanism of these electrons is coupled to the solar wind energy input. At impact the magnetic field strength in the coma increases by a factor of 2–5 as more interplanetary magnetic field piles up around the comet. During two CIR impact events  we observe possible plasma boundaries forming  or moving past Rosetta  as the strong solar wind compresses the cometary plasma environment. We also discuss the possibility of seeing some signatures of the ionospheric response to tail disconnection events."

We examined molecular markers of cartilage differentiation in chicken embryos. We found that the distal end of the fibula expresses Indian hedgehog (IHH)  undergoing terminal cartilage differentiation  and almost no Parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP)  which is required to develop a proliferative growth plate (epiphysis). Reduction of the distal fibula may be influenced earlier by its close contact with the nearby fibulare  which strongly expresses PTHrP. The epiphysis-like fibulare however then separates from the fibula  which fails to maintain a distal growth plate  and fibular reduction ensues. Experimental downregulation of IHH signaling at a postmorphogenetic stage led to a tibia and fibula of equal length: The fibula is longer than in controls and fused to the fibulare  whereas the tibia is shorter and bent. We propose that the presence of a distal fibular epiphysis may constrain greater growth in the tibia. Accordingly  many Mesozoic birds show a fibula that has lost its distal epiphysis  but remains almost as long as the tibia  suggesting that loss of the fibulare preceded and allowed subsequent evolution of great fibulo–tibial disparity."

The scientific value  and therefore animal ethics  of WF studies on GM crops is a matter addressable from the wealth of data available on commercialized GM crops and WF studies on irradiated foods. We reviewed available GM crop WF studies and considered the extent to which they add to the information from agronomic and compositional analyses. No WF toxicity study was identified that convincingly demonstrated toxicological concern or that called into question the adequacy  sufficiency  and reliability of safety assessments based on crop molecular characterization  transgene source  agronomic characteristics  and/or compositional analysis of the GM crop and its near-isogenic line. Predictions of safety based on crop genetics and compositional analyses have provided complete concordance with the results of well-conducted animal testing. However  this concordance is primarily due to the improbability of de novo generation of toxic substances in crop plants using genetic engineering practices and due to the weakness of WF toxicity studies in general. Thus  based on the comparative robustness and reliability of compositional and agronomic considerations and on the absence of any scientific basis for a significant potential for de novo generation of toxicologically significant compositional alterations as a sole result of transgene insertion  the conclusion of this review is that WF animal toxicity studies are unnecessary and scientifically unjustifiable."

We sought to investigate this “inoculation hypothesis” of tattooing as a costly honest signal of fitness. We hypothesized that the immune system habituates to the tattooing stressor in repeatedly tattooed individuals and that immune response to the stress of the tattooing process would correlate with lifetime tattoo experience. Methods: Participants were 24 women and 5 men (aged 18–47). We measured immune function using secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and cortisol (sCORT) in saliva collected before and after tattoo sessions. We measured tattoo experience as a sum of number of tattoos  lifetime hours tattooed  years since first tattoo  percent of body covered  and number of tattoo sessions.

Here  we use a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model of geographic profiling  a mathematical technique developed in criminology and finding increasing application within ecology and epidemiology  to analyse the spatial patterns of Banksy artworks in Bristol and London. The model takes as input the locations of these artworks  and calculates the probability of ‘offender’ residence across the study area. Our analysis highlights areas associated with one prominent candidate (e.g.  his home)  supporting his identification as Banksy. More broadly  these results support previous suggestions that analysis of minor terrorism-related acts (e.g.  graffiti) could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur  and provides a fascinating example of the application of the model to a complex  real-world problem."

Around T Tauri stars  the size of this disk hole is expected to be on a 0.1-AU scale that is unresolved by current adaptive optics imaging  though some model-dependent constraints have been obtained by near-infrared interferometry. Here we report the first measurement of the inner disk wall around a solar-mass young stellar object  YLW 16B in the {\\rho} Ophiuchi star-forming region  by detecting the light travel time of the variable radiation from the stellar surface to the disk. Consistent time lags were detected on two nights  when the time series in H (1.6 {\\mu}m) and K (2.2 {\\mu}m) bands were synchronized while the 4.5 {\\mu}m emission lagged by 74.5 +/- 3.2 seconds. Considering the nearly edge-on geometry of the disk  the inner rim should be 0.084 AU from the protostar on average  with an error of order 0.01 AU. This size is likely larger than the range of magnetospheric truncations  and consistent with an optically and geometrically thick disk front at the dust sublimation radius at ~1500 K. The widths of the cross-correlation functions between the data in different wavebands place possible new constraints on the geometry of the disk."

Here  we describe bioinspired strategies to design DNA thermoswitches with programmable linear response ranges that can provide either a precise ultrasensitive response over a desired  small temperature interval (±0.05 °C) or an extended linear response over a wide temperature range (e.g.  from 25 to 90 °C). Using structural modifications or inexpensive DNA stabilizers  we show that we can tune the transition midpoints of DNA thermometers from 30 to 85 °C. Using multimeric switch architectures  we are able to create ultrasensitive thermometers that display large quantitative fluorescence gains within small temperature variation (e.g.  > 700% over 10 °C). Using a combination of thermoswitches of different stabilities or a mix of stabilizers of various strengths  we can create extended thermometers that respond linearly up to 50 °C in temperature range. Here  we demonstrate the reversibility  robustness  and efficiency of these programmable DNA thermometers by monitoring temperature change inside individual wells during polymerase chain reactions. We discuss the potential applications of these programmable DNA thermoswitches in various nanotechnology fields including cell imaging  nanofluidics  nanomedecine  nanoelectronics  nanomaterial  and synthetic biology."

Fast evolution of mobile electronic devices leads to their premature replacement for always newer  faster  and nicer design and therefore may be a source of environmental pollution and contributes to global warming. Fortunately  due to the properties of the lithium ion (Li-ion) battery that powers them  there is in average 3 years of life left for the battery when the device is recycled or no longer in use after 2 years. This wastage can be valued by giving to the batteries a second life as energy storage for lighting. In fact  it can be a real opportunity for access to electricity in remote rural areas of developing countries for low cost and quality lighting. We present that used mobile phone batteries associated with a solar panel and a light emitting diode lamp can be a good replacement for candles or kerosene lamps that generate pollution  are hazardous  and only give poor lighting. Such a replacement can be done for much lower cost than current expenses  better quality of light  and contributes to poverty alleviation and job creation. This reduces wastage in developed countries and overcomes the challenges of cost and durability in small off-grid photovoltaic systems in non-electrified rural areas of developing countries. The creation of social incentive can have a real effect on the reduction of e-waste."

However  for most species the role of stilt roots is not well understood. We determined how palm size and slope inclination affected the structure of stilt roots in the neotropical palms Iriartea deltoidea and Socratea exorrhiza. We expected palm height to be lower on steep slopes because the effectiveness of root support could decrease as slope inclination increases  and thus  the structure of the root cone would vary mostly with slope. Alternatively  if stilt root development is determined by palm size  their production should match stem height  with taller palms having larger cones. We measured the stilt root cone of 31 Iriartea and 36 Socratea palms in San Ramón Biological Reserve and Golfito Wildlife Refuge  Costa Rica. We divided the cone into five variables (horizontal projections of the cone base and stilt root height up and down the slope  and width of the cone base)  from which we extracted the first two principal components and used them to measure the effects of slope and palm size on stilt root structure. We found stilt roots to be determined by palm size  not by slope conditions. Stilt roots matched palm size  with larger palms having taller and larger cones  maintaining stability under diverse slope conditions."

Since 1970 the mean age at first birth has increased in each of the 23 OECD countries for which data are available  at a rate of 0.08 years per calendar year  and now averages 28 years. Over the period 1995–2011  postponement of childbearing has been increasing faster  at 0.10 years per calendar year. In Germany and the UK  the mean age at first birth exceeds 30 years (OECD 2014). Advanced-age fertility has also been increasing: in Sweden in 2013  a quarter of all births were to mothers aged 35 or older. The potential consequences of postponement are numerous  including decreasing period fertility (Bongaarts and Feeney 1998) and negative health outcomes for children as a result of reproductive aging (Jacobsson  Ladfors  and Milson 2004). Although parental socioeconomic resources typically increase with age (Powell  Steelman  and Carini 2006)  advanced maternal age is associated with increased risks of Down syndrome  childhood cancer  and autism (Durkin et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2009; Yip  Pawitan  and Czene 2006). The research documenting these negative child outcomes  however  neglects the potential benefits of being born at a later date. For many important outcomes such as health and educational attainment  secular trends across the OECD countries are positive  so being born into a later birth cohort would appear to be beneficial. We illustrate this proposition using data from Sweden and a sibling–comparison design. We show that the macro-level trends outweigh the individual-level risk factors. In the process  we find that fertility postponement even up to maternal ages above 40 is associated with positive long-term outcomes for children. These results are likely to extend to other countries where health has been improving and educational access has been expanding  such as the United States and much of Europe."

Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE causes enzyme deficiency  resulting in increased substrate concentration (6-N-trimethyllysine) and decreased product levels (3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine and γ-butyrobetaine) in plasma and urine. TMLHE deficiency is common in control males (24 in 8 787 or 1 in 366) and was not significantly increased in frequency in probands from simplex autism families (9 in 2 904 or 1 in 323).

We investigated how triclosan impacts the community structure  function and antimicrobial resistance genes in lab-scale anaerobic digesters. Previously exposed (to triclosan) communities were amended with 5  50  and 500 mg/kg of triclosan  corresponding to the median  95th percentile  and 4-fold higher than maximum triclosan concentration that has been detected in U.S. biosolids. Triclosan amendment caused all of the Bacteria and Archaea communities to structurally diverge from that of the control cultures (based on ARISA). At the end of the experiment  all triclosan-amended Archaea communities had diverged from the control communities  regardless of the triclosan concentration added. In contrast  over time the Bacteria communities that were amended with lower concentrations of triclosan (5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) initially diverged and then reconverged with the control community structure. Methane production at 500 mg/kg was nearly half the methane production in control cultures. At 50 mg/kg  a large variability in methane production was observed  suggesting that 50 mg/kg may be a tipping point where function begins to fail in some communities. When previously unexposed communities were exposed to 500 mg triclosan/kg  function was maintained  but the abundance of a gene encoding for triclosan resistance (mexB) increased. This research suggests that triclosan could inhibit methane production in anaerobic digesters if concentrations were to increase and may also select for resistant Bacteria. In both cases  microbial community composition and exposure history alter the influence of triclosan."

Additionally  the TCC addition rate was varied to determine the impacts of acclimation time. At environmentally relevant TCC concentrations (max detect = 440 mg/kg)  digesters maintained function. Digesters receiving 450 mg/kg of TCC maintained function under gradual TCC addition  but volatile fatty acid concentrations increased  pH decreased  and methane production ceased when immediately fed this concentration. The concentrations of the mexB gene (encoding for a multidrug efflux pump) were higher with all concentrations of TCC compared to a control  but higher TCC concentrations did not correlate with increased mexB abundance. The relative abundance of the gene tet(L) was greater in the digesters that no longer produced methane  and no effect on the relative abundance of the class 1 integron integrase encoding gene (intI1) was observed. Illumina sequencing revealed substantial community shifts in digesters that functionally failed from increased levels of TCC. More subtle  yet significant  community shifts were observed in digesters amended with TCC levels that did not inhibit function. This research demonstrates that TCC can select for a multidrug resistance encoding gene in mixed community anaerobic environments  and this selection occurs at concentrations (30 mg/kg) that can be found in full-scale anaerobic digesters (U.S. median concentration = 22 mg/kg  mean = 39 mg/kg)."

Brain measures reveal a corresponding change in neural discrimination as the infant brain becomes selectively sensitive to its native language(s). Whether and how bilingual experience alters the transition to native language specific phonetic discrimination is important both theoretically and from a practical standpoint. Using whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG)  we examined brain responses to Spanish and English syllables in Spanish-English bilingual and English monolingual 11-month-old infants. Monolingual infants showed sensitivity to English  while bilingual infants were sensitive to both languages. Neural responses indicate that the dual sensitivity of the bilingual brain is achieved by a slower transition from acoustic to phonetic sound analysis  an adaptive and advantageous response to increased variability in language input. Bilingual neural responses extend into the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex  which may be related to their previously described bilingual advantage in executive function skills.

Experiment 2 shows that chewing the gum affects the experience of “hearing” the music and cannot be ascribed to a general effect on thinking about a tune only in abstract terms.

We showed that cells treated with the antiviral polymers inhibited TIM receptors from trafficking virus  likely from electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions  with EC50 values ranging from 2.6 to 6.8 mg/L  depending on the type of TIM receptors. Molecular docking computations revealed an unexpected  and general  specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with viral surface proteins  and virus and cell binding assay demonstrated a significant reduction in infection after incubating virus or cells with the antiviral polymers. Moreover  the mannose-functionalized macromolecules effectively prevented the virus from infecting the immune cells. Representative viruses from each category including dengue  influenza  Chikungunya  Enterovirus 71  Ebola  Marburg  and herpes simplex were surveyed  and viral infection was effectively prevented at polymer concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L with very high selectivity (>5000) over mammalian cells.

The most likely light-curve solution is double-peaked with a slight asymmetry; however  we cannot safely rule out the possibility of having a rotation period of Prot = 22.40 ± 0.18 hr  which corresponds to a single-peaked solution. Due to the size and slow rotation  the shape of the object should be a MacLaurin ellipsoid  so the light variation should be caused by surface inhomogeneities. Its newly derived larger diameter also implies larger surface gravity and a more likely retention of volatiles—CH4  CO  and N2—on the surface."

Participants All Danes aged ≥30 and born in Denmark after 1925  subdivided into subscribers and non-subscribers of mobile phones before 1995. Main outcome measures Risk of tumours of the central nervous system  identified from the complete Danish Cancer Register. Sex specific incidence rate ratios estimated with log linear Poisson regression models adjusted for age  calendar period  education  and disposable income. Results 358403 subscription holders accrued 3.8 million person years. In the follow-up period 1990-2007  there were 10729 cases of tumours of the central nervous system. The risk of such tumours was close to unity for both men and women. When restricted to individuals with the longest mobile phone use—that is  ≥13 years of subscription—the incidence rate ratio was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.27) in men and 0.91 (0.41 to 2.04) in women. Among those with subscriptions of ≥10 years  ratios were 1.04 (0.85 to 1.26) in men and 1.04 (0.56 to 1.95) in women for glioma and 0.90 (0.57 to 1.42) in men and 0.93 (0.46 to 1.87) in women for meningioma. There was no indication of dose-response relation either by years since first subscription for a mobile phone or by anatomical location of the tumour—that is  in regions of the brain closest to where the handset is usually held to the head. Conclusions In this update of a large nationwide cohort study of mobile phone use  there were no increased risks of tumours of the central nervous system  providing little evidence for a causal association."

Up to now  if subsurface structures are under investigation  only indirect methods revealed reliable results of the atoms’ spatial arrangement. An alternative and direct method is three-dimensional imaging by means of holography. Holography was in fact proposed for electron waves  because of the electrons’ short wavelength at easily accessible energies. Further  electron waves are ideal structure probes on an atomic length scale  because electrons have a high scattering probability even for light elements. However  holographic reconstructions of electron diffraction patterns have in the past contained severe image artifacts and were limited to at most a few tens of atoms. Here  we present a general reconstruction algorithm that leads to high-quality atomic images showing thousands of atoms. Additionally  we show that different elements can be identified by electron holography for the example of FeS2."

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non‐pharmacological intervention shown to be effective for pain relief in a variety of conditions. TENS may be able to alter the body's ability to receive and perceive pain signals rather than having a direct effect on uterine contractions. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of high and low‐frequency TENS when compared to placebo  no treatment  or medical treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. Search methods: Electronic searches of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of controlled trials  The Cochrane Library (Issue 1  2009)  MEDLINE  EMBASE  CINAHL  and AMED were performed (updated April 2009) to identify relevant randomised controlled trials. The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Register of controlled trials (CISCOM) was also searched. Attempts were also made to identify trials from the UK National Research Register  the Clinical Trial Register  and the citation lists of review articles and included trials. Selection criteria: The inclusion criteria were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of TENS compared to placebo  no treatment  or medical treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. Exclusion criteria were: mild  infrequent  or secondary dysmenorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea associated with an intrauterine device (IUD). Data collection and analysis: Seven RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. No new studies were identified in the update. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Data unsuitable for meta‐analysis were reported as descriptive data and were included for discussion. The outcome measures were pain relief (dichotomous  visual analogue scale  descriptive)  adverse effects  use of analgesics additional to treatment  and absence from work or school. Main results: Overall  high‐frequency TENS was shown to be more effective for pain relief than placebo TENS (OR 7.2  95% CI 3.1 to 16.5). Low‐frequency TENS was found to be no more effective in reducing pain than placebo TENS (OR 1.48  95% CI 0.43 to 5.08). There were conflicting results regarding whether high‐frequency TENS was more effective than low‐frequency TENS. Authors' conclusions: High‐frequency TENS was found to be effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea by a number of small trials. The minor adverse effects reported in one trial require further investigation. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of low‐frequency TENS in reducing dysmenorrhoea."

Aims: The study aims to report orgasmic feelings in the left foot of a woman. Methods: A woman presented with complaints of undesired orgasmic sensations originating in her left foot. In-depth interview  physical examination  sensory testing  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-scan)  electromyography (EMG)  transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)  and blockade of the left S1 dorsal root ganglion were performed. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcomes are description of this clinical syndrome  results of TENS application  and S1 dorsal root ganglion blockade. Results: Subtle attenuation of sensory amplitudes of the left suralis  and the left medial and lateral plantar nerve tracts was found at EMG. MRI-scan disclosed no foot abnormalities. TENS at the left metatarso-phalangeal joint-III of the left foot elicited an instant orgasmic sensation that radiated from plantar toward the vagina. TENS applied to the left side of the vagina elicited an orgasm that radiated to the left foot. Diagnostic blockade of the left S1 dorsal root ganglion with 0.8L bupivacaine 0.25mg attenuated the frequency and intensity of orgasmic sensation in the left foot with 50% and 80%  respectively. Additional therapeutic blockade of the same ganglion with 0.8mL bupivacaine 0.50mg combined with pulsed radiofrequency treatment resulted in a complete disappearance of the foot-induced orgasmic sensations. Conclusion: Foot orgasm syndrome (FOS) is descibed in a woman. Blockade of the left S1 dorsal root ganglion alleviated FOS. It is hypothesized that FOS  occurring 1.5 years after an intensive care emergency  was caused by partial nerve regeneration (axonotmesis)  after which afferent (C-fiber) information from a small reinnervated skin area of the left foot and afferent somatic and autonomous (visceral) information from the vagina on at least S1 spinal level is misinterpreted by the brain as being solely information originating from the vagina."

Surgical-therapeutic attempts may be apparent by the presence of fractures  however  ritual or nonmedical motives are rarely supported by visible evidence in the bones. This article presents data on the trepanations of several individuals from South Russia dating to the Eneolitic and Bronze Age that may indicate a ritual procedure. In these crania an operation was performed in the identical location  the midline  furthermore in one of the most dangerous places  on the obelion. No evidence for traumatic or other pathological reasons for performing the operations was observable. Material and Methods: Investigations of two nearby areas of South Russia revealed 13 individuals showing complete perforations in the midline of the cranium. Another one  displaying a depression in the same place  primarily diagnosed as an incomplete trepanation  is discussed considering all differential diagnoses. The trepanations were investigated macroscopically  by plain radiography and computed tomography. The lesions were described in detail  including data on technique  position  size  shape  state of healing  and complications. Results: Males and females received the operation between the age of 10 years and mature/senile age. Only grooving and scraping techniques were used and their application differed between sexes. The majority of the patients survived the intervention for a long time. Discussion: The region of Southern Russia seems to be a center for special trepanations performed by skilled surgeons  the specific position of the perforations implying more a ritual than therapeutic reason for trepanning."

Thus  it directly investigated the partner characteristics that reflect both risk and attractiveness as well as the correlation between these two concepts. Every one of the 36 attributes were viewed as important by at least some respondents and there was wide variance in the frequency with which they were chosen. While almost 80% of the respondents felt it was important to know something about the potential partner's ‘appearance’  less than 4% felt it was important to know about ‘accessories’. In addition to ‘appearance’  only 3 other attributes were selected as one of the 15 most important by at least 60% of respondents. The gamma association across aspects between average risk and average attractiveness was −0.61  suggesting that the more one is attracted to some aspect of a potential partner  the less likely is one to view that aspect as ‘risky’. This may help explain why it sometimes appears that risk information is ignored when it concerns a partner to whom one is attracted. Somewhat surprisingly  there were remarkable similarities between gender and among ethnicities with respect to both selecting attributes that are important in partner selection and in identifying both attractive and risky aspects"

Almost two wavelengths of the Rossby wave fit across the basin  and it has a period of 120 days. The porous boundary of the Caribbean Sea results in this mode exciting a mass exchange with the wider ocean  leading to a dominant mode of bottom pressure variability which is almost uniform over the Grenada  Venezuela  and Colombia basins and has a sharp spectral peak at 120 day period.

The bendy solar cells could power wearable electronics like fitness trackers and smart glasses. The researchers report the results in the journal Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing. Thin materials flex more easily than thick ones - think a piece of paper versus a cardboard shipping box. The reason for the difference: The stress in a material while it's being bent increases farther out from the central plane. Because thick sheets have more material farther out they are harder to bend. Our photovoltaic is about 1 micrometer thick  said Jongho Lee, an engineer at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea. One micrometer is much thinner than an average human hair. Standard photovoltaics are usually hundreds of times thicker, and even most other thin photovoltaics are 2 to 4 times thicker."

In general, thinner microelectronic devices are under less strain when bent. This paper describes strategies to realize ultra-thin GaAs photovoltaics through the interlayer adhesiveless transfer-printing of vertical-type devices onto metal surfaces. The vertical-type GaAs photovoltaic devices recycle reflected photons by means of bottom electrodes. Systematic studies with four different types of solar microcells indicate that the vertical-type solar microcells, at only a quarter of the thickness of similarly designed lateral-type cells, generate a level of electric power similar to that of thicker cells. The experimental results along with the theoretical analysis conducted here show that the ultra-thin vertical-type solar microcells are durable under extreme bending and thus suitable for use in the manufacturing of wearable flexible electronics."

Here, we propose that, above a certain group-size threshold, maintaining a belief in the continued existence of authority figures after their death preserves group coordination efficiency. That is, we argue that coordination activities in larger groups become more effective when they center on symbolic (although formerly real) bearers of authority; for smaller groups, we claim the opposite occurs. Our argument is pursued by way of a collective action model that makes anthropologically plausible assumptions about human sociality. One key finding is the existence of a group-size threshold that marks the difference between the two different collective action regimes, one with and one without the presence of a deified historical figure. Another is that, in larger groups, priest-like castes naturally emerge as a consequence of the benefits of personally identifying with the deified agent."

However, the distribution of such modes over large distances remains difficult. Intermodal coupling complicates their use with common fibers, while free-space transmission is thought to be strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. Here we show the transmission of orbital angular momentum modes of light over a distance of 143 kilometers between two Canary Islands, which is 50 times greater than the maximum distance achieved previously. As a demonstration of the transmission quality, we use superpositions of these modes to encode a short message. At the receiver, an artificial neural network is used for distinguishing between the different twisted light superpositions. The algorithm is able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy of more than 80% up to the third mode order, and decode the transmitted message with an error rate of 8.33%. Using our data, we estimate that the distribution of orbital angular momentum entanglement over more than 100 kilometers of free space is feasible. Moreover, the quality of our free-space link can be further improved by the use of state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems."

Physical properties of lightning are related to plume dynamics, and associated electromagnetic field variations are revealed by video observations (high speed and normal speed) together with infrasound and high sampling rate magnetotelluric signals. Data show that volcanic lightning at Sakurajima mainly occurs in the plume gas thrust region at a few hundred meters above the crater rim, where the overpressure of the turbulent volcanic jets determines the electrification of particles generating a complex charge structure in the growing plume. Organization of charges may be achieved at later stages when the plume transitions from the jet phase to the convective phase. Comparison with atmospheric sounding and maximum plume height data show that the effect of hydrometeors on flash generation at Sakurajima is negligible and can be more prudently considered as an additional factor contributing to the electrification of volcanic plumes."

In addition to being one of the largest molecules detected in disks to date  methanol is also the first disk organic molecule with an unambiguous ice chemistry origin. The stacked methanol emission  as observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array  is spectrally resolved and detected across six velocity channels (>3sigma)  reaching a peak signal-to-noise of 5.5 sigma  with the kinematic pattern expected for TW Hya. Using an appropriate disk model  a fractional abundance of 3x10^(-12)-4x10^(-11) (with respect to H_2) reproduces the stacked line profile and channel maps  with the favored abundance dependent upon the assumed vertical location (midplane versus molecular layer). The peak emission is offset from the source position  suggesting that the methanol emission has a ring-like morphology: the analysis here suggests it peaks at approximately 30 au  reaching a column density 3--6x10^12 cm^−2. In the case of TW Hya  the larger (up to millimeter-sized) grains  residing in the inner 50 au  may thus host the bulk of the disk ice reservoir.

Namely  closed metal cavities  when fueled with microwaves  have delivered thrust that could eventually maintain satellites on orbits using solar power. However  the measured thrust appears to be without any apparent exhaust. Thus the Law of Action-Reaction seems to have been violated. We consider the possibility that the exhaust is in a form that has so far escaped both experimental detection and theoretical attention. In the thruster’s cavity microwaves interfere with each other and invariably some photons will also end up co-propagating with opposite phases. At the destructive interference electromagnetic fields cancel. However  the photons themselves do not vanish for nothing but continue in propagation. These photon pairs without net electromagnetic field do not reflect back from the metal walls but escape from the resonator. By this action momentum is lost from the cavity which  according to the conservation of momentum  gives rise to an equal and opposite reaction. We examine theoretical corollaries and practical concerns that follow from the paired-photon conclusion."

This latest addition to the still-small family of CBPs defies the current trend of known short-period planets orbiting near the stability limit of binary stars. Unlike the previous discoveries  the planet revolving around the eclipsing binary system Kepler-1647 has a very long orbital period (∼ 1100 days) and was at conjunction only twice during the Kepler mission lifetime. Due to the singular configuration of the system  Kepler1647b is not only the longest-period transiting CBP at the time of writing  but also one of the longest-period transiting planets.

The planet produced three transits in the light-curve of Kepler1647 (one of them during an eclipse  creating a syzygy) and measurably perturbed the times of the stellar eclipses  allowing us to measure its mass to be 1.52 ± 0.65 MJup.

If damaged cells manage to bypass the checkpoints where the integrity of the genome is assessed and the decisions whether to proceed with the cell cycle are made  they may evade the imperative to stop dividing and to die. As a result  cancer may develop. Warding off the potential sequence-altering effects of DNA damage during the life of the individual or the existence span of the species is controlled by a set of larger checkpoints acting on a progressively increasing scale  from systematic removal of damaged cells from the proliferative pool by means of repair of DNA damage/programmed cell death through ageing to  finally  cancer. They serve different purposes and act at different levels of the life cycle  safeguarding the integrity of the genetic backup of the individual  the genetic diversity of the population  and  finally  the survival of the species and of life on Earth.

We found that the use of these devices before bedtime prolongs the time it takes to fall asleep  delays the circadian clock  suppresses levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin  reduces the amount and delays the timing of REM sleep  and reduces alertness the following morning. Use of light-emitting devices immediately before bedtime also increases alertness at that time  which may lead users to delay bedtime at home. Overall  we found that the use of portable light-emitting devices immediately before bedtime has biological effects that may perpetuate sleep deficiency and disrupt circadian rhythms  both of which can have adverse impacts on performance  health  and safety. Abstract: In the past 50 y  there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality  with adverse consequences on general health. A representative survey of 1 508 American adults recently revealed that 90% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelength–enriched light emitted by these electronic devices  given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects  suppress melatonin  and phase-shift the biological clock. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels  but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode  exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness  reduced melatonin secretion  later timing of their circadian clock  and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock  acutely suppresses melatonin  and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep  performance  health  and safety."

        "text": "We update the method of the Holmberg & Flynn (2000) study  including an updated model of the Milky Way's interstellar gas  radial velocities  an updated reddening map  and a careful statistical analysis  to bound the allowed surface density and scale height of a dark disk. We pay careful attention to the self-consistency of the model  including the gravitational influence of the dark disk on other disk components  and to the net velocity of the tracer stars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the vertical direction as well as a displacement from the expected location at the Galactic midplane. If not properly accounted for  these features would bias the bound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In the first  traditional method  we subtract the mean velocity and displacement from the tracers' phase space distributions. In the second method  we perform a non-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk parameters for an oscillating tracer distribution. Despite updates in the mass model and reddening map  the traditional method results remain consistent with those of HF2000. The second  non-equilibrium technique  however  allows a surface density as large as 14M⊙pc−2 (and as small as 0)  demonstrating much weaker constraints. For both techniques  the bound on surface density is weaker for larger scale height. In future analyses of Gaia data  it will be important to verify whether the tracer populations are in equilibrium."

        "text": "There have been several popular reports of various groups exploiting the deterministic nature of the game of roulette for profit. Moreover  through its history  the inherent determinism in the game of roulette has attracted the attention of many luminaries of chaos theory. In this paper  we provide a short review of that history and then set out to determine to what extent that determinism can really be exploited for profit. To do this  we provide a very simple model for the motion of a roulette wheel and ball and demonstrate that knowledge of initial position  velocity  and acceleration is sufficient to predict the outcome with adequate certainty to achieve a positive expected return. We describe two physically realizable systems to obtain this knowledge both incognito and in situ. The first system relies only on a mechanical count of rotation of the ball and the wheel to measure the relevant parameters. By applying these techniques to a standard casino-grade European roulette wheel  we demonstrate an expected return of at least 18%  well above the −2.7% expected of a random bet. With a more sophisticated  albeit more intrusive  system (mounting a digital camera above the wheel)  we demonstrate a range of systematic and statistically significant biases which can be exploited to provide an improved guess of the outcome. Finally  our analysis demonstrates that even a very slight slant in the roulette table leads to a very pronounced bias which could be further exploited to substantially enhance returns."

In the second experiment  83 college students ranked the interest value and likelihood of spreading gossip about male or female professors  relatives  friends  acquaintances  or strangers based on 12 different gossip scenarios. The results of these experiments confirmed a consistent pattern of interest in gossip marked by a preference for information about others of the same age and gender.

Improvements come from new  near-infrared observations of Cepheid variables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe~Ia  more than doubling the sample of SNe~Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage the magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe~Ia at z<0.15. All 19 hosts and the megamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3  thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258  more Cepheids and a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs  HST observations of Cepheids in M31  and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC4258  (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC  (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes  and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51  72.04+/-2.67  76.18+/-2.37  and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc  respectively. Our best estimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258  MW  and LMC  and includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4%. This value is 3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3 neutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data  but reduces to 2.1 sigma relative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO  suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H_0 at face value  one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early Universe in the range of Delta N_eff=0.4-1. We anticipate significant improvements in H_0 from upcoming parallax measurements."

The dark matter and GCs are assumed to follow different spatial distributions; we assume power-law model profiles and use the model distribution functions described in Evans et al. and Deason et al. We explore the relationships between assumptions about model parameters and how these assumptions affect mass profile estimates. We also explore how using subsamples of the GC population beyond certain radii affect mass estimates. After exploring the posterior distributions of different parameter assumption scenarios  we conclude that a conservative estimate of the Galaxy's mass within 125 kpc is 5x11 M.  with a 50% probability region of (4.79  5.63) x 10^11 M. Extrapolating out to the virial radius  we obtain a virial mass for the MW of 6.82 x 10^11 M with 50% credible region of (6.06 7.53)x10^11M (r_vir = 185 kpc.). If we consider only the GCs beyond 10 kpc  then the virial mass is 9.02( 5.69  10.86)x10^11 M  (r_vir = 198 kpc). We also arrive at an estimate of the velocity anisotropy parameter β of the GC population  which is ß = 0.28 with a 50% credible region (0.21  0.35).

Spectra obtained using Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy on the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS show DES14X3taz is an SLSN-I at z = 0.608. Multi-color photometry reveals a double-peaked light curve: a blue and relatively bright initial peak that fades rapidly prior to the slower rise of the main light curve. Our multi-color photometry allows us  for the first time  to show that the initial peak cools from 22 000 to 8000 K over 15 rest-frame days  and is faster and brighter than any published core-collapse supernova  reaching 30% of the bolometric luminosity of the main peak. No physical 56Ni-powered model can fit this initial peak. We show that a shock-cooling model followed by a magnetar driving the second phase of the light curve can adequately explain the entire light curve of DES14X3taz. Models involving the shock-cooling of extended circumstellar material at a distance of ≃400R are preferred over the cooling of shock-heated surface layers of a stellar envelope. We compare DES14X3taz to the few double-peaked SLSN-I events in the literature. Although the rise times and characteristics of these initial peaks differ  there exists the tantalizing possibility that they can be explained by one physical interpretation."

The permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) is the amplification of surface warming due to CO2 and CH4 emissions from thawing permafrost. An analysis of available estimates PCF strength and timing indicate 120 ± 85 Gt of carbon emissions from thawing permafrost by 2100. This is equivalent to 5.7 ± 4.0% of total anthropogenic emissions for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and would increase global temperatures by 0.29 ± 0.21 °C or 7.8 ± 5.7%. For RCP4.5  the scenario closest to the 2 °C warming target for the climate change treaty  the range of cumulative emissions in 2100 from thawing permafrost decreases to between 27 and 100 Gt C with temperature increases between 0.05 and 0.15 °C  but the relative fraction of permafrost to total emissions increases to between 3% and 11%. Any substantial warming results in a committed  long-term carbon release from thawing permafrost with 60% of emissions occurring after 2100  indicating that not accounting for permafrost emissions risks overshooting the 2 °C warming target. Climate projections in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)  and any emissions targets based on those projections  do not adequately account for emissions from thawing permafrost and the effects of the PCF on global climate. We recommend the IPCC commission a special assessment focusing on the PCF and its impact on global climate to supplement the AR5 in support of treaty negotiation."

Methods: Mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses were performed on 302 free-ranging white sharks collected from five sites along the South African coastline. This was augmented with 58 GenBank sequences originating from five distinct global populations. Genetic diversity  local population sub-structuring analyses and global phylogeographical patterns were determined. Results: Four mtDNA haplotypes restricted to South Africa were recovered. One common haplotype was shared by 89% of all the individuals and was 13 bp different from the second most common haplotype shared by 10% of the remaining sharks. No local geographical sub-structuring was evident for either mtDNA or nuclear DNA. Both data sets show a remarkably low level of genetic diversity (mtDNA: h = 0.205  π = 0.0027; nDNA: Na = 7.6  Ho = 0.675). At the global scale  three distinct geographical clades were detected which could not be connected with 95% confidence in the haplotype network. Main conclusions: Results indicate that the observed South African mtDNA biogeographical pattern and diversity levels may be a consequence of a severe bottleneck or a recent colonization event from one or two sources. Globally  the population of white sharks can be differentiated into three mtDNA clades confined to (1) the Mediterranean and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Australia and California)  (2) the North West Atlantic (Florida) and Indian Ocean (South Africa)  and (3) a single divergent haplotype restricted to South Africa. The pattern is most likely the result of a combination of site philopatry  isolation by distance  infrequent long-distance dispersal  isolated founder events and the closure of the Isthmus of Panama."

This paper aimed to clarify the strength of the evidence for alcohol as a cause of cancer  and the meaning of cause in this context. Methods: Recent epidemiological and biological research on alcohol and cancer was reviewed and summarized  drawing upon published meta-analyses identified from the Medline database and the archives of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. More recent epidemiological studies not included in these publications were also reviewed. A brief description of the nature of causal inference in epidemiology was used to frame discussion of the strength of the evidence that alcohol causes cancer  and contrast this with the case for a protective association of alcohol with cardiovascular disease. Results: The usual epidemiological understanding of a cause is a factor that increases the incidence of a condition in the population. In the context of a body of epidemiological evidence of an association of alcohol consumption with a disease  the inference that it is a causal association requires alternative explanations of the observed finding to be judged unlikely. Even without complete knowledge of biological mechanisms  the epidemiological evidence can support the judgement that alcohol causes cancer of the oropharynx  larynx  oesophagus  liver  colon  rectum and breast. The measured associations exhibit gradients of effect that are biologically plausible  and there is some evidence of reversibility of risk in laryngeal  pharyngeal and liver cancers when consumption ceases. The limitations of cohort studies mean that the true effects may be somewhat weaker or stronger than estimated currently  but are unlikely to be qualitatively different. The same  or similar  epidemiological studies also commonly report protection from cardiovascular disease associated with drinking but a high level of scepticism regarding these findings is now warranted. Conclusions: There is strong evidence that alcohol causes cancer at seven sites in the body and probably others. Current estimates suggest that alcohol-attributable cancers at these sites make up 5.8% of all cancer deaths world-wide. Confirmation of specific biological mechanisms by which alcohol increases the incidence of each type of cancer is not required to infer that alcohol is a cause."

The children's standardised verbal and non-verbal reasoning scores were also obtained. Children who used their mobiles to send three or more text messages a day had significantly lower scores than children who sent none. However  the children who  when asked to write a text message  showed greater use of text abbreviations (‘textisms’) tended to have better performance on a measure of verbal reasoning ability  which is highly associated with Key Stage 2 (KS2) and 3 English scores. In Study Two  children's performance on writing measures was examined more specifically. Ten to eleven-year-old children were asked to complete another English to text message translation exercise. Spelling proficiency was also assessed  and KS2 Writing scores were obtained. Positive correlations between spelling ability and performance on the translation exercise were found  and group-based comparisons based on the children's writing scores also showed that good writing attainment was associated with greater use of textisms  although the direction of this association is nor clear. Overall  these findings suggest that children's knowledge of textisms is not associated with poor written language outcomes for children in this age range."

The hypothesis predicts a greater loss will be identified in ocular disease. Additionally  we sought to develop a theoretical framework that would allow comparisons of thresholds with disease progression when using different Goldmann targets. Methods: The Humphrey Field Analyser (HFA) 30-2 grid was used in 13 patients with early/established optic nerve disease using the current Goldmann III target size or a combination of the three smallest stimuli (target size I  II and III). We used data from control subjects at each of the visual field locations for the different target sizes to establish the number of failed points (events) for the patients with optic nerve disease  as well as global indices for mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD). Results: The 30-2 visual field testing using alternate target size stimuli showed that all 13 patients displayed more defects (events) compared to the standard Goldmann III target size. The median increase for events was seven additional failed points: (range 1–26). The global indices also increased when the new testing approach was used (MD −3.47 to −6.25 dB and PSD 4.32 to 6.63 dB). Spatial summation mapping showed an increase in critical area (Ac) in disease and overall increase in thresholds when smaller target stimuli were used. Conclusions: When compared to the current Goldmann III paradigm  the use of alternate sized targets within the 30-2 testing protocol revealed a greater loss in patients with optic nerve disease for both event analysis and global indices (MD and PSD). We therefore provide evidence in a clinical setting that target size is important in visual field testing."

This has been proposed many times in the past  and simple  single-radius models can qualitatively match the observed increase in QPO frequency by decreasing a characteristic radius  as predicted by the truncated disc models. However  this also predicts that the frequency is strongly dependent on spin  and gives a maximum frequency at the last stable orbit which is generally much higher than the remarkably constant maximum frequency at ∼10 Hz observed in all black hole binaries. The key aspect of our model  which makes it match these observations  is the precession of a radially extended region of the hot inner flow. The outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc as above  but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at the point where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for a misaligned flow. Physically motivated analytic estimates for this inner radius show that it increases with a*  decreasing the expected frequency in a way which almost completely cancels the expected increase with spin  and ties the maximum predicted frequency to around 10 Hz for all a*. This is the first QPO model which explains both frequencies and spectrum in the context of a well-established geometry for the accretion flow."

The present study investigated the behaviour of melatonin (assessed as 6-sulphatoxymelatonin); rectal temperature; activity and sleep (actigraphy and logs) in constant dim light (L/L) with access to a digital clock. 6 normal healthy males were maintained as a group in partial temporal isolation with attenuated sound and ambient temperature for 21 days. All 6 subjects showed free-running periodicity for 6-sulphatoxymelatonin and 5/6 subjects for temperature  activity and sleep offset. The average period (tau) was 24.26±0.049  substantially shorter than in previous experiments with a self selected L/D cycle but similar to a recent study conducted in very dim light. One subject maintained a rigid sleep/wake cycle throughout whilst his 6-sulphatoxymelatonin rhythm free-ran. Total sleep time  from actigraph data  did not change but sleep efficiency decreased during the experiment. The subjects did not show group synchronization. These results confirm previous data indicating the importance of the L/D cycle in human entrainment and underline the lesser role of social cues and knowledge of clock time. This particular approach will permit the administration of timed medication to sighted humans under free-running conditions."

By examining the phase space dynamics of the model  we study the mechanism leading to the difference typically experienced in the severity of jet-lag resulting from eastward and westward travel."

        "text": "Most birds vocalize with an open beak  but vocalization with a closed beak into an inflating cavity occurs in territorial or courtship displays in disparate species throughout birds. Closed-mouth vocalizations generate resonance conditions that favor low-frequency sounds. By contrast  open-mouth vocalizations cover a wider frequency range. Here we describe closed-mouth vocalizations of birds from functional and morphological perspectives and assess the distribution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and related outgroups. Ancestral-state optimizations of body size and vocal behavior indicate that closed-mouth vocalizations are unlikely to be ancestral in birds and have evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves  predominantly in large-bodied lineages. Closed-mouth vocalizations are rare in the small-bodied passerines. In light of these results and body size trends in nonavian dinosaurs  we suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. As in birds  this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays  and hence would have co-occurred with open-mouthed vocalizations."

Successful implementation of immunoisolation has been hampered by the foreign-body reaction to biomaterials. We screened a variety of commercially available membranes for foreign-body reactions following implantation under the skin of rats. Histologic analysis revealed that neovascularization at the membrane–tissue interface occurred in several membranes that had pore sizes large enough to allow complete penetration by host cells (0.8-8-μm pore size). When the vascularization of the membrane–tissue interface of 5-μm-pore-size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes was compared to 0.02-μm-pore-size PTFE membranes  it was found that the larger pore membranes had 80–100-fold more vascular structures. The increased vascularization was observed even though the larger pore membrane was laminated to a smaller pore inner membrane to prevent cell entry into the prototype immunoisolation device. This significantly higher level of vascularization was maintained for 1 year in the subcutaneous site in rats."

        "text": "To develop a widely applicable method to estimate body size in theropods  the scaling relationship between skull length  body length  and body mass was investigated using 13 strictly carnivorous  non-avialan theropod taxa ranging in size from the 1-m Sinosauropteryx prima to the 12-m Tyrannosaurus rex. Body length was obtained from the literature for complete to nearly-complete specimens and body mass was obtained from three-dimensional mathematical slicing of those same specimens to ensure accurate body length-body mass associations. Least-square regressions reveal a tight correlation between skull length and body length (SK-BL) and skull length and body mass (SK-BM). The SK-BL regression is negatively allometric  which indicates that skulls become longer relative to body length with increasing body size. In contrast  the SK-BM regression is positively allometric  indicating that body mass increases faster than skull length with increasing body size. These conclusions confirm that the common practice of scaling isometrically smaller relatives of a given taxon to obtain body length and body mass estimates is not valid. Although predictive equations derived from the regressions fail to predict accurately body size in abelisaurids and juvenile theropods due to their different head/body proportions  they produce accurate body size estimates for theropods of known body size  thus validating their applicability. Body size estimates for Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus  approaching 13 m and 14 tons  suggest that they may have surpassed Tyrannosaurus in size. A revised body size estimate for a large Spinosaurus specimen suggests a much shorter and heavier animal than recently suggested."

To contribute to addressing this challenge  we examine the link between water stress and society through socio-hydrological modeling. We conceptualize the interactions between an agricultural society with its environment in a stylized way. We apply the model to the case of the ancient Maya  a population that experienced a peak during the Classic Period (AD 600–830) and then declined during the ninth century. The hypothesis that modest drought periods played a major role in the society's collapse is explored. Simulating plausible feedbacks between water and society we show that a modest reduction in rainfall may lead to an 80% population collapse. Population density and crop sensitivity to droughts  however  may play an equally important role. The simulations indicate that construction of reservoirs results in less frequent drought impacts  but if the reservoirs run dry  drought impact may be more severe and the population drop may be larger."

Important constraints include the following: (1) the Ryukyu slab is ~1000km N-S  too short to account for ~20° Philippine Sea northward motion from paleolatitudes; (2) the Marianas-Pacific subduction zone was at its present location (±200km) since 48±10Ma based on a >1000km deep slab wall; (3) the 8000×2500km East Asian Sea existed between the Pacific and Indian Oceans at 52Ma based on lower mantle flat slabs; (4) the Caroline back-arc basin moved with the Pacific  based on the overlapping  coeval Caroline hot spot track. These new constraints allow two classes of Philippine Sea plate models  which we compared to paleomagnetic and geologic data. Our preferred model involves Philippine Sea nucleation above the Manus plume (0°/150°E) near the Pacific-East Asian Sea plate boundary. Large Philippine Sea westward motion and post-40Ma maximum 80° clockwise rotation accompanied late Eocene-Oligocene collision with the Caroline/Pacific plate.

We evaluated financial and in-kind benefit streams from tourism and hunting on 77 communal conservancies in Namibia from 1998 to 2013  where community-based wildlife conservation has been promoted as a land-use that complements traditional subsistence agriculture. We used data collected annually for all communal conservancies to characterize whether benefits were derived from hunting or tourism. We classified these benefits into 3 broad classes and examined how benefits flowed to stakeholders within communities under the status quo and under a simulated ban on hunting. Across all conservancies  total benefits from hunting and tourism increased at roughly the same rate  although conservancies typically started generating benefits from hunting within 3 years of formation as opposed to after 6 years for tourism. Disaggregation of data revealed that the main benefits from hunting were income for conservancy management and food in the form of meat for the community at large. The majority of tourism benefits were salaried jobs at lodges. A simulated ban on trophy hunting significantly reduced the number of conservancies that could cover their operating costs  whereas eliminating income from tourism did not have as severe an effect. Given that the benefits generated from hunting and tourism typically begin at different times in a conservancy's life-span (earlier vs. later  respectively) and flow to different segments of local communities  these 2 activities together may provide the greatest incentives for conservation on communal lands in Namibia. A singular focus on either hunting or tourism would reduce the value of wildlife as a competitive land-use option and have grave repercussions for the viability of community-based conservation efforts in Namibia  and possibly other parts of Africa."

We find that people's aspirations for upward economic and social mobility lead them to participate in neoliberal conservation projects in an attempt to combine economic opportunities created by nature-based tourism with traditional livelihood strategies. In this case  certain aspects of neoliberal conservation are perceived as a source of hope for non-elites seeking to achieve economic self-sufficiency and to ascend social hierarchies. We find that intra-community power struggles dominate discourses of discontent and local-level conflict which consequently masks the disruptive and anomic forces of the global tourism industry. We additionally provide insight into specific social contexts that may increase the allure of neoliberal conservation and explain why marginalized individuals may embrace some neoliberal logics despite — or  perhaps  because of — their disruptive tendencies."

This scenario reminds us of the pandemic potential of the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV  an agent that is thought to be acquired from camels without presently causing sustained human-to-human transmission. Abstract: The four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are globally endemic respiratory pathogens. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV) is an emerging CoV with a known zoonotic source in dromedary camels. Little is known about the origins of endemic HCoVs. Studying these viruses’ evolutionary history could provide important insight into CoV emergence. In tests of MERS-CoV–infected dromedaries  we found viruses related to an HCoV  known as HCoV-229E  in 5.6% of 1 033 animals. Human- and dromedary-derived viruses are each monophyletic  suggesting ecological isolation. One gene of dromedary viruses exists in two versions in camels  full length and deleted  whereas only the deleted version exists in humans. The deletion increased in size over a succession starting from camelid viruses via old human viruses to contemporary human viruses. Live isolates of dromedary 229E viruses were obtained and studied to assess human infection risks. The viruses used the human entry receptor aminopeptidase N and replicated in human hepatoma cells  suggesting a principal ability to cause human infections. However  inefficient replication in several mucosa-derived cell lines and airway epithelial cultures suggested lack of adaptation to the human host. Dromedary viruses were as sensitive to the human type I interferon response as HCoV-229E. Antibodies in human sera neutralized dromedary-derived viruses  suggesting population immunity against dromedary viruses. Although no current epidemic risk seems to emanate from these viruses  evolutionary inference suggests that the endemic human virus HCoV-229E may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated viruses. HCoV-229E evolution provides a scenario for MERS-CoV emergence."

We examined the movement patterns of an introduced population of C. auratus in a south-western Australian river using passive acoustic telemetry. The study population had a high residency index within the array (i.e. proportion of all days at liberty that  on average  each fish was detected by a receiver) with fish being detected on 64% of days. The individuals were also reasonably mobile  travelling a mean of 0.30 km (linear river kilometres).day-1 within the array  and one fish moved 231.3 km over the 365-day study period (including 5.4 km in a 24 hr period). Importantly  C. auratus displayed significant seasonal movement patterns including a clear shift in habitats during its breeding period with most mature individuals being detected in an off-channel wetland during that time. The results of this study strongly suggest that C. auratus undertook a spawning migration into a lentic habitat. These results have important implications for developing control programmes for the species  such as targeting connections to off-channel lentic systems during its breeding period."

Each atmospheric version is coupled to two different ocean general circulation models: the Russell ocean model (GISS-E2-R) and HYCOM (GISS-E2-H). By 2100  global mean warming in the RCP scenarios ranges from 1.0 to 4.5°C relative to 1850–1860 mean temperature in the historical simulations. In the RCP2.6 scenario  the surface warming in all simulations stays below a 2°C threshold at the end of the 21st century. For RCP8.5  the range is 3.5–4.5°C at 2100. Decadally averaged sea ice area changes are highly correlated to global mean surface air temperature anomalies and show steep declines in both hemispheres  with a larger sensitivity during winter months. By the year 2500  there are complete recoveries of the globally averaged surface air temperature for all versions of the GISS climate model in the low-forcing scenario RCP2.6. TCADI simulations show enhanced warming due to greater sensitivity to CO2  aerosol effects  and greater methane feedbacks  and recovery is much slower in RCP2.6 than with the NINT and TCAD versions. All coupled models have decreases in the Atlantic overturning stream function by 2100. In RCP2.6  there is a complete recovery of the Atlantic overturning stream function by the year 2500 while with scenario RCP8.5  the E2-R climate model produces a complete shutdown of deep water formation in the North Atlantic."

Here we consider how the earliest cells might have harnessed a geochemically created proton-motive force and then learned to make their own  a transition that was necessary for their escape from the vents. Synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis today involves generation of an ion gradient by means of vectorial electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor.

Seemingly against this trend  however  BDE-99 did not appear to bioaccumulate in the fish  which may be due to partitioning from the MBs or it being metabolized in vivo.

Several variants of planetary migration with this kind of system architecture have been proposed. Here  we focus on a highly successful case  which assumes that there were once five planets in the outer Solar System in a stable configuration: Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and a Neptune-like body. Beyond these planets existed a primordial disk containing thousands of Pluto-sized bodies  ∼50 million D > 100 km bodies  and a multitude of smaller bodies. This system eventually went through a dynamical instability that scattered the planetesimals and allowed the planets to encounter one another. The extra Neptune-like body was ejected via a Jupiter encounter  but not before it helped to populate stable niches with disk planetesimals across the Solar System. Here  we investigate how interactions between the fifth giant planet  Jupiter  and disk planetesimals helped to capture disk planetesimals into both the asteroid belt and first-order mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. Using numerical simulations  we find that our model produces the right proportion of P- and D-type asteroids in the inner  central  and outer main belt  while also populating the Hilda and Thule regions in Jupiter's 3/2 and 4/3 resonances. Moreover  the largest observed P/D types in each sub-population are an excellent fit to our captured population results (within uncertainties). The model produces a factor of ∼10 overabundance of diameter D > 10 km P/D types in the main belt  but this mismatch can likely be explained by various removal mechanisms (e.g.  collision evolution over 4 Gyr  dynamical losses via Yarkovsky thermal forces over 4 Gyr  thermal destruction of the planetesimals en route to the inner solar system). Overall  our instability model provides a more satisfying match to constraints than that of Levison et al.  and it provides us with strong supporting evidence that the five giant planet instability model is reasonable. Our results lead us to predict that D-type asteroids found in the near-Earth object population on low delta-V orbits with Earth are the surviving relics from the same source population that now make up the Kuiper Belt  the irregular satellites  and the Jupiter Trojans. The singular Tagish Lake meteorite  a primitive sample unlike other carbonaceous chondrite meteorites  is likely a fragment from a D-type asteroid implanted into the inner main belt. This would effectively make it the first known hand sample with the same composition as Kuiper Belt objects."

A key finding is that the parautochthonous fossil assemblages are preserved across a salinity gradient  with diversity (measured by the Simpson Index) declining from open marine environments  through brackish embayments  and reaching a nadir in tidal estuaries. Chondrichthyans dominate the entire salinity spectrum (65% of fossils)  a distribution that demonstrates a euryhaline mode of life  and one large predatory chondrichthyan  Orthacanthus  may have practised filial cannibalism in coastal nurseries because its heteropolar coprolites contain juvenile xenacanthid teeth. In contrast  other fish communities were more common in open marine settings while tetrapods were more common in coastal brackish waters. While all these faunas were also likely to have been euryhaline  their osmoregulation was  perhaps  less versatile. The demonstration of widespread euryhalinity among fish and aquatic tetrapods explains why Pennsylvanian faunas generally show a cosmopolitan biogeography because taxa were able to disperse via seaways. It also resolves the paradox of enriched strontium isotopic signatures observed in these faunas because organisms would have been  at times  exposed to continental water bodies as well. Therefore  our new findings contribute to the long-running debate about the ecology of Pennsylvanian fishes and tetrapods."

The publication generated huge interest from scientists and the general public. However  ‘Piltdown man's’ initial celebrity has long been overshadowed by its subsequent infamy as one of the most famous scientific frauds in history. Our re-evaluation of the Piltdown fossils using the latest scientific methods (DNA analyses  high-precision measurements  spectroscopy and virtual anthropology) shows that it is highly likely that a single orang-utan specimen and at least two human specimens were used to create the fake fossils. The modus operandi was found consistent throughout the assemblage (specimens are stained brown  loaded with gravel fragments and restored using filling materials)  linking all specimens from the Piltdown I and Piltdown II sites to a single forger—Charles Dawson. Whether Dawson acted alone is uncertain  but his hunger for acclaim may have driven him to risk his reputation and misdirect the course of anthropology for decades. The Piltdown hoax stands as a cautionary tale to scientists not to be led by preconceived ideas  but to use scientific integrity and rigour in the face of novel discoveries."

The storm made its initial mark with a colossal solar radio burst causing radio interference at frequencies between 0.01 and 9.0GHz and near-simultaneous disruptions of dayside radio communication by intense fluxes of ionizing solar X-rays. Aspects of military control and communication were immediately challenged. Within hours a solar energetic particle event disrupted high-frequency communication in the polar cap. Subsequently  record-setting geomagnetic and ionospheric storms compounded the disruptions. We explain how the May 1967 storm was nearly one with ultimate societal impact  were it not for the nascent efforts of the United States Air Force in expanding its terrestrial weather monitoring-analysis-warning-prediction efforts into the realm of space weather forecasting. An important and long-lasting outcome of this storm was more formal Department of Defense-support for current-day space weather forecasting. This story develops during the rapid rise of solar cycle 20 and the intense Cold War in the latter half of the twentieth century. We detail the events of late May 1967 in the intersecting categories of solar-terrestrial interactions and the political-military backdrop of the Cold War. This was one of the “Great Storms” of the twentieth century  despite the apparent lack of large geomagnetically induced currents. Radio disruptions like those discussed here warrant the attention of today's radio-reliant  cellular-phone and satellite-navigation enabled world."

To investigate why  we reviewed accounts of 115 interactions between them. Humpbacks initiated the majority of interactions (57% vs. 43%; n = 72)  although the killer whales were almost exclusively mammal-eating forms (MEKWs  95%) vs. fish-eaters (5%; n = 108). When MEKWs approached humpbacks (n = 27)  they attacked 85% of the time and targeted only calves. When humpbacks approached killer whales (n = 41)  93% were MEKWs  and ≥87% of them were attacking or feeding on prey at the time. When humpbacks interacted with attacking MEKWs  11% of the prey were humpbacks and 89% comprised 10 other species  including three cetaceans  six pinnipeds  and one teleost fish. Approaching humpbacks often harassed attacking MEKWs (≥55% of 56 interactions)  regardless of the prey species  which we argue was mobbing behavior. Humpback mobbing sometimes allowed MEKW prey  including nonhumpbacks  to escape. We suggest that humpbacks initially responded to vocalizations of attacking MEKWs without knowing the prey species targeted. Although reciprocity or kin selection might explain communal defense of conspecific calves  there was no apparent benefit to humpbacks continuing to interfere when other species were being attacked. Interspecific altruism  even if unintentional  could not be ruled out."

We recently reported evidence for transient Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs in canonical B-DNA based on NMR carbon relaxation dispersion. While the carbon chemical shifts measured for the transient state were consistent with a syn orientation for the purine base  as expected for A(syn)•T(anti) and G(syn)•C+(anti) HG base pairing  HG type hydrogen bonding could only be inferred indirectly. Here  we develop two independent approaches for directly probing transient changes in N–H···N hydrogen bonds and apply them to the characterization of transient Hoogsteen type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA. The first approach takes advantage of the strong dependence of the imino nitrogen chemical shift on hydrogen bonding and involves measurement of R1ρ relaxation dispersion for the hydrogen-bond donor imino nitrogens in G and T residues. In the second approach  we assess the consequence of substituting the hydrogen-bond acceptor nitrogen (N7) with a carbon (C7H7) on both carbon and nitrogen relaxation dispersion data. Together  these data allow us to obtain direct evidence for transient Hoogsteen base pairs that are stabilized by N–H···N type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA. The methods introduced here greatly expand the utility of NMR in the structural characterization of transient states in nucleic acids."

The question of whether SO2 frost on the surface plays a part  and to what degree  in maintaining Io's atmosphere with the constant volcanic outgassing is still debated. It is believed that for a sublimation-supported atmosphere  the primary atmosphere should collapse during eclipses by Jupiter  as the SO2 vapor pressure is strongly coupled to the temperature of the ice on the surface. No direct observations of Io's atmosphere in eclipse have previously been possible  due to the simultaneous need for high spectral and time sensitivity  as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio. Here we present the first ever high-resolution spectra at 19µm of Io's SO2 atmosphere in Jupiter eclipse from the Gemini telescope. The strongest atmospheric band depth is seen to dramatically decay from 2.5±(0.08)% before the eclipse to 0.18±(0.16)% after 40min in eclipse. Further modeling indicates that the atmosphere has collapsed shortly after eclipse ingress  implying that the atmosphere of Io has a strong sublimation-controlled component. The atmospheric column density—from pre-eclipse to in-eclipse—drops by a factor of 5±2."

The orgasm in women does not obviously contribute to the reproductive success  and surprisingly unreliably accompanies heterosexual intercourse. Two types of explanations have been proposed: one insisting on extant adaptive roles in reproduction  another explaining female orgasm as a byproduct of selection on male orgasm  which is crucial for sperm transfer. We emphasize that these explanations tend to focus on evidence from human biology and thus address the modification of a trait rather than its evolutionary origin. To trace the trait through evolution requires identifying its homologue in other species  which may have limited similarity with the human trait. Human female orgasm is associated with an endocrine surge similar to the copulatory surges in species with induced ovulation. We suggest that the homolog of human orgasm is the reflex that  ancestrally  induced ovulation. This reflex became superfluous with the evolution of spontaneous ovulation  potentially freeing female orgasm for other roles. This is supported by phylogenetic evidence showing that induced ovulation is ancestral  while spontaneous ovulation is derived within eutherians. In addition  the comparative anatomy of female reproductive tract shows that evolution of spontaneous ovulation is correlated with increasing distance of clitoris from the copulatory canal. In summary  we suggest that the female orgasm-like trait may have been adaptive  however for a different role  namely for inducing ovulation. With the evolution of spontaneous ovulation  orgasm was freed to gain secondary roles  which may explain its maintenance  but not its origin."

Their relationship to the source rock suggests that gully-forming processes transported underlying material downslope. There is no evidence for specific compositions being more likely to be associated with gullies or with the formation of hydrated minerals in situ as a result of recent liquid water activity. Seasonal CO2 and H2O frosts were observed in gullies at middle to high latitudes  consistent with seasonal frost-driven processes playing important roles in the evolution of gullies.

A decrease in atmospheric CO2 may have played a role during the onset of glaciations  but other tectonic and oceanic events occurring at the same time may have played a part as well. Here we present detailed atmospheric CO2 estimates from boron isotopes in planktic foraminifer shells spanning 4.6–2.0 Ma. Maximal Pliocene atmospheric CO2 estimates gradually declined from values around 410 μatm to early Pleistocene values of 300 μatm at 2.0 Ma. After the onset of large-scale ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere  maximal pCO2 estimates were still at 2.5 Ma +90 μatm higher than values characteristic of the early Pleistocene interglacials. By contrast  Pliocene minimal atmospheric CO2 gradually decreased from 310 to 245 μatm at 3.2 Ma  coinciding with the start of transient glaciations on Greenland. Values characteristic of early Pleistocene glacial atmospheric CO2 of 200 μatm were abruptly reached after 2.7 Ma during the late Pliocene transition. This trend is consistent with the suggestion that ocean stratification and iron fertilization increased after 2.7 Ma in the North Pacific and Southern Ocean and may have led to increased glacial CO2 storage in the oceanic abyss after 2.7 Ma onward."

They can serve as alert signals that enable neighbouring leaves and plants to pre-emptively increase defences and avoid herbivory damage. However  our understanding of the factors mediating volatile organic compound (VOC) signal interpretation by receiver plants and the degree to which multiple herbivores affect VOC signals is still limited. Here we investigated whether plant responses to damage-induced VOC signals were population specific. As a secondary goal  we tested for interference in signal production or reception when plants were subjected to multiple types of herbivore damage. We factorially crossed the population sources of paired Phaseolus lunatus plants (same versus different population sources) with a mechanical damage treatment to one member of the pair (i.e. the VOC emitter  damaged versus control)  and we measured herbivore damage to the other plant (the VOC receiver) in the field. Prior to the experiment  both emitter and receiver plants were naturally colonized by aphids  enabling us to test the hypothesis that damage from sap-feeding herbivores interferes with VOC communication by including emitter and receiver aphid abundances as covariates in our analyses. One week after mechanical leaf damage  we removed all the emitter plants from the field and conducted fortnightly surveys of leaf herbivory. We found evidence that receiver plants responded using population-specific ‘dialects’ where only receivers from the same source population as the damaged emitters suffered less leaf damage upon exposure to the volatile signals. We also found that the abundance of aphids on both emitter and receiver plants did not alter this volatile signalling during both production and reception despite well-documented defence crosstalk within individual plants that are simultaneously attacked by multiple herbivores. Overall  these results show that plant communication is highly sensitive to genetic relatedness between emitter and receiver plants and that communication is resilient to herbivore co-infestation."

African lions exhibit a relatively high degree of sexual dimorphism  with the larger males typically developing a conspicuous coat of long hair on their chest  neck and back  termed a ‘mane’ (Schaller  1972). The length and darkness of a male lion's mane is thought to be driven by sexual selection pressures  with females preferentially associating with dark-maned males and male lions preferentially attacking light-maned males (West & Packer  2002). Mane development in male lions has been the focus of much interest over the last century (Schaller  1972; Kays & Patterson  2002; West & Packer  2002; Yamaguchi et al.  2004). Potential factors driving mane development in male lions are thought to include genetics  temperature  nutritional status  hormones and vegetation thickness (Kays & Patterson  2002; West & Packer  2002). To date  mane development has only been reported in males  and has never been formally documented in female lions.

Research has shown that measuring headache-related disability  together with assessments of pain intensity  headache frequency  tiredness  mood alterations and cognition can be used to assess the impact of migraine on sufferers’ lives and society. From this research  two simple and brief impact tools were developed: the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire and the Headache Impact Test (HIT). Both tools are scientifically valid measures of migraine severity and have the potential to improve communication between patients and their physicians  assess migraine severity and act as outcome measures to monitor treatment efficacy. Each of these tools offers its own advantages. For example  HIT was designed for greater accessibility (on the Internet at www.headachetest.com and www.amIhealthy.com  and as a paper-based form known as HIT-6) and has a wider coverage of the spectrum of headache than MIDAS. Impact tools are also being increasingly recommended as part of generalised headache management guidelines to produce an individualised treatment plan for each patient in concert with other clinical assessments. It is not possible as yet to recommend unequivocally the optimal impact tool for use in primary care  but it should be usable by GPs  pharmacists  nurses and patients  and for research purposes."

These findings confirm that self-administered doses of intravenous heroin are sufficient to activate the mesolimbic dopamine system and suggest that significant heroin “craving” can emerge when dopamine levels are still moderately elevated  long before the development of dopamine depletion associated with opiate withdrawal."

There they studied the feasibility of deploying ballistic missiles within the ice sheet. The base and its wastes were abandoned with minimal decommissioning in 1967  under the assumption they would be preserved for eternity by perpetually accumulating snowfall. Here we show that a transition in ice sheet surface mass balance at Camp Century from net accumulation to net ablation is plausible within the next 75years  under a business-as-usual anthropogenic emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). Net ablation would guarantee the eventual remobilization of physical  chemical  biological  and radiological wastes abandoned at the site. While Camp Century and four other contemporaneous ice sheet bases were legally established under a Danish-U.S. treaty  the potential remobilization of their abandoned wastes  previously regarded as sequestered  represents an entirely new pathway of political dispute resulting from climate change."

Because many of the airborne magnetite pollution particles are <200 nm in diameter  they can enter the brain directly through the olfactory nerve and by crossing the damaged olfactory unit. This discovery is important because nanoscale magnetite can respond to external magnetic fields  and is toxic to the brain  being implicated in production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because enhanced ROS production is causally linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease  exposure to such airborne PM-derived magnetite nanoparticles might need to be examined as a possible hazard to human health. Abstract: Biologically formed nanoparticles of the strongly magnetic mineral  magnetite  were first detected in the human brain over 20 y ago [Kirschvink JL  Kobayashi-Kirschvink A  Woodford BJ (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89(16):7683–7687]. Magnetite can have potentially large impacts on the brain due to its unique combination of redox activity  surface charge  and strongly magnetic behavior. We used magnetic analyses and electron microscopy to identify the abundant presence in the brain of magnetite nanoparticles that are consistent with high-temperature formation  suggesting  therefore  an external  not internal  source. Comprising a separate nanoparticle population from the euhedral particles ascribed to endogenous sources  these brain magnetites are often found with other transition metal nanoparticles  and they display rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures  reflecting crystallization upon cooling from an initially heated  iron-bearing source material. Such high-temperature magnetite nanospheres are ubiquitous and abundant in airborne particulate matter pollution. They arise as combustion-derived  iron-rich particles  often associated with other transition metal particles  which condense and/or oxidize upon airborne release. Those magnetite pollutant particles which are <∼200 nm in diameter can enter the brain directly via the olfactory bulb. Their presence proves that externally sourced iron-bearing nanoparticles  rather than their soluble compounds  can be transported directly into the brain  where they may pose hazard to human health."

New studies on the strength of these submicroscopic cylinders of carbon indicate that on an ounce-for-ounce basis they are at least 117 times stronger than steel and 30 times stronger than Kevlar  the material used in bulletproof vests and other products. The findings  which could expand commercial and industrial applications of nanotube materials  appear in the monthly journal ACS Nano. Stephen Cronin and colleagues point out that nanotubes — barely 1/50 000th the width of a human hair — have been renowned for exceptional strength  high electrical conductivity  and other properties. Nanotubes can stretch considerably like toffee before breaking. This makes them ideal for a variety of futuristic applications  even  if science fiction ever become reality  as cables in “space elevators” that lift objects from the Earth’s surface into orbit. To resolve uncertainties about the actual strength of nanotubes  the scientists applied immense tension to individual carbon nanotubes of different lengths and widths. They found that nanotubes could be stretched up to 14 percent of their normal length without breaking  or more than twice that of previous reports by others. The finding establishes “a new lower limit for the ultimate strength of carbon nanotubes ” the article noted."

Normally  the QBO would show a steady downward propagation of the westerly phase. In 2015–2016  there was an anomalous upward displacement of this westerly phase from ~30 hPa to 15 hPa. These westerlies impinge on or “cutoff” the normal downward propagation of the easterly phase. In addition  easterly winds develop at 40 hPa. Comparisons to tropical wind statistics for the 1953 to present record demonstrate that this 2015–2016 QBO disruption is unprecedented."

The accumulation rates and temporal trends of triclosan  CTDs  and dioxins in aquatic sediments were found to be a function of historical wastewater treatment operations and lake system scale. Cores collected from large-scale riverine systems with many wastewater sources recorded increasing concentrations of triclosan  CTDs  and their derived dioxins since the patent of triclosan in 1964. In small-scale lakes with a single wastewater source  the trends were directly attributed to increased triclosan use  local improvements in treatment  and changes in wastewater disinfection since the 1960s. In the lake with no wastewater input  no triclosan or CTDs were detected. Overall  concentrations of triclosan  CTDs  and their dioxins were higher in small-scale systems  reflecting a greater degree of wastewater impact. In cores collected in northern MN  the four dioxins derived from triclosan are present prior to the patent of triclosan  suggesting a secondary source.

The elements have features typical of Azhdarchoidea  an identification consistent with dominance of this group in the latest Cretaceous. The new material is significant for its size and ontogenetic stage: the humerus and vertebrae indicate a wingspan of ca 1.5m  but histological sections and bone fusions indicate the individual was approaching maturity at time of death. Pterosaurs of this size are exceedingly rare in Upper Cretaceous strata  a phenomenon commonly attributed to smaller pterosaurs becoming extinct in the Late Cretaceous as part of a reduction in pterosaur diversity and disparity. The absence of small juveniles of large species—which must have existed—in the fossil record is evidence of a preservational bias against small pterosaurs in the Late Cretaceous  and caution should be applied to any interpretation of latest Cretaceous pterosaur diversity and success."

The defects exhibit a broad range of multicolor room-temperature single photon emissions across the visible and the near-infrared spectral ranges  narrow line widths of sub-10 nm at room temperature  and a short excited-state lifetime  and high brightness. We show that the emitters can be categorized into two general groups  but most likely possess similar crystallographic structure. Remarkably  the emitters are extremely robust and withstand aggressive annealing treatments in oxidizing and reducing environments. Our results constitute a step toward deterministic engineering of single emitters in 2D materials and hold great promise for the use of defects in boron nitride as sources for quantum information processing and nanophotonics."

As a direct consequence of this decrease more impacted third molars are left in situ and yet  little is known about the natural history of these teeth. Objective: The aim of this study was to create an actuarial life-table and related survival analysis that would shed light on the natural history of an impacted lower third molar. Methods: Panoramic radiographs taken in 14 different general dental practices in Scotland were analysed and matched with their respective case notes in order to generate a sample of patients with asymptomatic impacted lower third molars. Subjects were assessed to confirm the presence of impaction and absence of symptoms and then re-assessed 1year later for the development of symptoms during the study period to relate the incidence of symptoms within 1year in the sample studied to age. Logistic regression was used to construct a life table based on the survival of symptom-free teeth (independently of extraction) during the study period. Results: The number of patients included in the study was 583 and 421 for the baseline and follow-up assessments respectively. The total number of teeth analysed in both appointments was 676; from those 37 (5.47%) were extracted during the study period. About 562 teeth (83.13%) survived the study period symptom-free. There was a statistically significant inverse association between the development of symptoms studied and age. There was no statistically significant association between extraction and age. Conclusions: The study indicates that older patients are less likely to develop the symptoms studied. In addition the authors believe that there is evidence to suggest that general dental practitioners might not be following current guidelines when deciding whether or not to extract an impacted lower third molar in the centres studied."

Previous reports of conjoined twins in sharks are scarce and only refer to oviparous and ovoviviparous species. Seven dicephalous sharks reported so far were similar to the specimen described here  namely  with two totally separated heads on one body. Instead  only one case of diprosopus shark has been reported; it had a single body and a single head with partial duplication of the face. Two further cases described in the literature as dicephalous or simply as abnormal sharks should be better regarded as diprosopus  while another three cases  also considered dicephalous  showed a mixture of characteristics of diprosopia and dicephalia."

To confirm our observation  in a dietitian clinical setting two parallel groups of migraineurs  one receiving a 1-month very-low-calorie KD prescription followed by a 5-month standard low-calorie diet (SD) and the other a 6-month SD  were followed. Methods: Ninety-six overweight female migraineurs were enrolled in a diet clinic and blindly received a KD (n = 45) or an SD (n = 51) prescription. Mean monthly attack frequency  number of days with headaches and tablet intake were assessed before and 1  2  3 and 6 months after diet initiation. Results: In the KD group  the baseline attack frequency (2.9 attacks per month)  number of days with headaches (5.11 days per month) and tablet intake (4.91 doses per month) were significantly reduced after the first month of diet (respectively 0.71  0.91  0.51; overall  KD versus baseline  P < 0.0001). During the transition period (first versus second month)  the KD group showed a transient worsening of each clinical headache variable (respectively 2.60  3.60  3.07)  despite being improved compared with baseline  with continuous improvement up to month 6 (respectively 2.16  2.78  3.71). In the SD group  significant decreases in the number of days with headaches and tablet intake were observed only from month 3 (P < 0.0001)  and in attack frequency at month 6 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The underlying mechanisms of KD efficacy could be related to its ability to enhance mitochondrial energy metabolism and counteract neural inflammation."

Methods: Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry  and RMR was determined by indirect calorimetry at baseline  at the end of the 30-week competition and 6 years later. Metabolic adaptation was defined as the residual RMR after adjusting for changes in body composition and age. Results: Of the 16 “Biggest Loser” competitors originally investigated  14 participated in this follow-up study. Weight loss at the end of the competition was (mean±SD) 58.3±24.9 kg (P < 0.0001)  and RMR decreased by 610±483 kcal/day (P = 0.0004). After 6 years  41.0±31.3 kg of the lost weight was regained (P = 0.0002)  while RMR was 704±427 kcal/day below baseline (P < 0.0001) and metabolic adaptation was −499±207 kcal/day (P < 0.0001). Weight regain was not significantly correlated with metabolic adaptation at the competition's end (r=−0.1  P = 0.75)  but those subjects maintaining greater weight loss at 6 years also experienced greater concurrent metabolic slowing (r = 0.59  P = 0.025).

The high ion velocities  together with the high ionisation fraction and the quasineutrality of the exhaust stream  make the cathodic arc an attractive plasma source for spacecraft propulsion applications. The specific impulse of the cathodic arc thruster is substantially increased when the emission of neutral species is reduced. Here  we demonstrate a reduction of neutral emission by exploiting sublimation in cathode spots and enhanced ionisation of the plasma in short  high-current pulses. This  combined with the enhanced directionality due to the efficient erosion profiles created by centre-triggering  substantially increases the specific impulse. We present experimentally measured specific impulses and jet power efficiencies for titanium and magnesium fuels. Our Mg fuelled source provides the highest reported specific impulse for a gridless ion thruster and is competitive with all flight rated ion thrusters. We present a model based on cathode sublimation and melting at the cathodic arc spot explaining the outstanding performance of the Mg fuelled source. A further significant advantage of an Mg-fuelled thruster is the abundance of Mg in asteroidal material and in space junk  providing an opportunity for utilising these resources in space."

Impaired noradrenergic activity and  to a lesser extent  serotonergic dysfunction are common to most of these disorders but are not always associated with elevated NRH. In contrast  dysfunction of the labyrinth  its neural projection areas  or both  apparently exists in all cases involving a proven elevation in NRH  but not in other disorders associated with neurochemical imbalances but normal percentages of right‐handedness. It is theorized that inputs from the vestibular system to the locus coeruleus  raphe nucleus  and other brainstem structures are critical to the development of motoric dominance and the lateralization of monoaminergic activity in the central nervous system  whereas the contribution of vestibular dysfunction to overall central nervous system neurochemical imbalances is considerably less significant."

This new species is based on isolated teeth found from five globally distributed localities: the Jewett Sand in southern California  USA; the Pungo River Formation of North Carolina  USA; the Chilcatay Formation of Peru; the Oi Formation in Mie Prefecture  Japan; and the O’oshimojo Formation in Nagano Prefecture  Japan. Extrapolations based on available published data on modern macrophagous lamniforms suggest that the largest specimen of M. paradoxodon gen. nov. et sp. nov. possibly came from an individual that measured at least 3.7 m in total length. All specimens came from deposits in the mid-latitudinal zones representing shallow-water  shelf-type  coastal environments. Its dentition likely exhibited monognathic heterodonty suited for capturing and cutting relatively large prey (e.g. medium-sized fishes). We recommend the genus Otodus to include sharks of the ‘megatoothed’ (e.g. megalodon) lineage in order to avoid Otodus paraphyly. We also propose the following phylogenetic hypothesis: [Kenolamna+[Cretalamna+[Megalolamna + Otodus]]]."

This type of calving is common on polar ice shelves  with no clear connection to ocean-ice dynamic forcing. In contrast  we report on the recent development of multiple rifts initiating from basal crevasses in the center of the ice shelf  resulted in calving further upglacier than previously observed. Coincident with rift formation was the sudden disintegration of the ice mélange that filled the northern shear margin  resulting in ice sheet detachment from this margin. Examination of ice velocity suggests that this internal rifting resulted from the combination of a change in ice shelf stress regime caused by disintegration of the mélange and intensified melting within basal crevasses  both of which may be linked to ocean forcing."

The prosthesis was found  together with commingled human remains  in the collective tomb of the aristocratic family of the Guinigi  a powerful family who governed Lucca from 1392 until 1429. The exact archaeological dating of the prosthesis was not possible  but some elements suggest a dating to the beginning of the 17th century. Purpose: Aim of the paper is to study and describe the dental appliance trough a multidisciplinary approach. Materials and Methods: Macroscopical and micro-CT examinations were performed to investigate the technics used for the realization of the dental prosthesis. SEM analysis was performed to study alloy composition of the metallic fixing lamina and microstructure of the deposits on the dental surface. Results: The dental prosthesis consists in five mandibular teeth: three central incisors and two lateral canines linked together by a golden band inserted into the dental roots to replace the anterior arch of the jaw. Micro-CT scan revealed the presence of two small golden pins inserted into each tooth crossing the root and fixing the teeth to the internal gold band. SEM examination of the lamina indicated a homogeneous composition  with average contents of 73 wt% gold  15.6 wt% Ag  and 11.4 wt% Cu. Apposition of dental calculus on the teeth indicated that the prosthesis had been worn for a long period. Conclusions: This dental prosthesis provides a unique finding of technologically advanced dentistry in this period. In fact  during the Early Modern Age  some authors described gold band technology for the replacement of missing teeth; nevertheless  no direct evidences of these devices have been brought to light up so far."

Here  we report high-performance core/shell nanowire supercapacitors based on an array of one-dimensional (1D) nanowires seamlessly integrated with conformal 2D TMD layers. The 1D and 2D supercapacitor components possess “one-body” geometry with atomically sharp and structurally robust core/shell interfaces  as they were spontaneously converted from identical metal current collectors via sequential oxidation/sulfurization. These hybrid supercapacitors outperform previously developed any stand-alone 2D TMD-based supercapacitors; particularly  exhibiting an exceptional charge–discharge retention over 30 000 cycles owing to their structural robustness  suggesting great potential for unconventional energy storage technologies."

In Australia  when GPS surface displacements were corrected for local mass change (hydrology  atmosphere  and ocean) with Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) data  the residual GPS data reveal a peculiar seasonal mode of continental deformation. During the southern summer  the entire continent coherently shifts northwest by ~1mm and the southeastern part is uplifted  while the northwestern part is subsided by 2–3mm and the opposite patterns of deformation are observed during the southern winter. Such characteristic deformation could be understood to be a result of the Earth's elastic response to globally averaged surface mass load  generally heavier in Europe during southern summer and in the South Pacific Ocean during southern winter. It was found that such deformation is even larger than local hydrology-induced loading effects in horizontal motion over Australia. A simple method of determining locations of the CM was developed by combining GPS and GRACE data; the latter being insensitive to the CM motion but sufficiently accurate to remove the local hydrologic and atmospheric effects in GPS data. The CM signals are pronounced over systematic errors in GPS and GRACE data. The CM coordinates estimated by inversion of the Australian GPS data set and GRACE agree with the geocenter motions determined by satellite tracking analysis. This study suggests an independent way of monitoring the CM motion entirely based on two distinct geodetic measurements of GPS and GRACE."

The analyzed records have an average twentieth century rate of approximately 1.6 mm/yr  but based on the locations of these gauges  we show that the simple average underestimates the twentieth century global mean rate by 0.1 ± 0.2 mm/yr.

Our analysis shows dramatic declines of cheetah across its distributional range. Most cheetah occur outside protected areas  where they are exposed to multiple threats  but there is little information on population status. Simulation modeling shows that  where cheetah population growth rates are suppressed outside protected areas  extinction risk increases markedly. This result can be generalized to other “protection-reliant” species  and a decision tree is provided to improve their extinction risk estimation. Ultimately  the persistence of protection-reliant species depends on their survival outside and inside protected areas and requires a holistic approach to conservation that engages rather than alienates local communities. Abstract: Establishing and maintaining protected areas (PAs) are key tools for biodiversity conservation. However  this approach is insufficient for many species  particularly those that are wide-ranging and sparse. The cheetah Acinonyx jubatus exemplifies such a species and faces extreme challenges to its survival. Here  we show that the global population is estimated at ∼7 100 individuals and confined to 9% of its historical distributional range. However  the majority of current range (77%) occurs outside of PAs  where the species faces multiple threats. Scenario modeling shows that  where growth rates are suppressed outside PAs  extinction rates increase rapidly as the proportion of population protected declines. Sensitivity analysis shows that growth rates within PAs have to be high if they are to compensate for declines outside. Susceptibility of cheetah to rapid decline is evidenced by recent rapid contraction in range  supporting an uplisting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List threat assessment to endangered. Our results are applicable to other protection-reliant species  which may be subject to systematic underestimation of threat when there is insufficient information outside PAs. Ultimately  conserving many of these species necessitates a paradigm shift in conservation toward a holistic approach that incentivizes protection and promotes sustainable human–wildlife coexistence across large multiple-use landscapes."

To make such a link  we assessed how physiological variation among individuals predicted dispersal in natural populations of unisexual (all-female) and sexual Ambystoma salamanders on the same fragmented landscape in Ohio. Specifically  we assessed variation in a trait that influences long-distance animal movement (locomotor endurance) and determined whether variation in endurance matched patterns of realized dispersal assessed using genetic assignment tests. A possible mechanism for why unisexuals would have lower locomotor endurance than a sympatric sexual species (Ambystoma texanum) is the potential energetic cost of evolutionarily mismatched mitochondrial and nuclear genomes within polyploid unisexuals. We found that sexuals walked four times farther than unisexuals during treadmill endurance trials that mimic the locomotor endurance required for dispersal. We then applied landscape genetic methods to identify dispersed adults and quantify realized dispersal. We show that the differences in locomotor endurance between unisexual and sexual salamanders scale to realized dispersal: dispersing sexual individuals travelled approximately twice the distance between presumed natal wetlands and the site of capture compared to dispersing unisexuals. This study links variation in individual performance in terms of endurance with realized dispersal in the field and suggests a potential mechanism (physiological limitation due to mitonuclear mismatch) for the reduced endurance of unisexual individuals relative to sexual individuals although we discuss other possible explanations. The differences in dispersal between these two types of salamanders also informs our understanding of sexual/unisexual coexistence by suggesting that unisexuals are at a competitive disadvantage in terms of colonization ability under a extinction-colonization model of coexistence."

Analysis of a flow culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa through untreated PDMS and iPDMS tubing shows at least an order of magnitude reduction of biofilm formation on iPDMS  and almost complete absence of biofilm on iPDMS after a gentle water rinse. The iPDMS materials can be applied as a coating on other polymers or prepared by simply immersing silicone tubing in silicone oil  and are compatible with traditional sterilization methods. As a demonstration  we show the preparation of silicone-coated polyurethane catheters and significant reduction of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation on the catheter surface. This work represents an important first step toward a simple and effective means of preventing bacterial adhesion on a wide range of materials used for medical devices."

However  it is not clear whether schizophrenia confers an inherent risk for glucose dysregulation in the absence of the effects of chronic illness and long-term treatment. Objective  To conduct a meta-analysis examining whether individuals with first-episode schizophrenia already exhibit alterations in glucose homeostasis compared with controls. Data Sources  The EMBASE  MEDLINE  and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched for studies examining measures of glucose homeostasis in antipsychotic-naive individuals with first-episode schizophrenia compared with individuals serving as controls. Study Selection  Case-control studies reporting on fasting plasma glucose levels  plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test  fasting plasma insulin levels  insulin resistance  and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in first-episode antipsychotic-naive individuals with first-episode schizophrenia compared with healthy individuals serving as controls. Two independent investigators selected the studies. Data Extraction  Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences in fasting plasma glucose levels  plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test  fasting plasma insulin levels  insulin resistance  and HbA1c levels were calculated. Sensitivity analyses examining the effect of body mass index  diet and exercise  race/ethnicity  and minimal (≤2 weeks) antipsychotic exposure were performed. Data Synthesis  Of 3660 citations retrieved  16 case-control studies comprising 15 samples met inclusion criteria. The overall sample included 731 patients and 614 controls. Fasting plasma glucose levels (Hedges g=0.20; 95% CI  0.02 to 0.38; P=.03)  plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test (Hedges g=0.61; 95% CI  0.16 to 1.05; P=.007)  fasting plasma insulin levels (Hedges g=0.41; 95% CI  0.09 to 0.72; P=.01)  and insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) (Hedges g=0.35; 95% CI  0.14 to 0.55; P=.001) were all significantly elevated in patients compared with controls. However  HbA1c levels (Hedges g=−0.08; CI  −0.34 to 0.18; P=.55) were not altered in patients compared with controls. Conclusions and Relevance  These findings show that glucose homeostasis is altered from illness onset in schizophrenia  indicating that patients are at increased risk of diabetes as a result. This finding has implications for the monitoring and treatment choice for patients with schizophrenia."

Three species of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus  Diaemus youngi  and Diphylla ecaudata) rely on blood as their only food. The first two are considered less specialized  whereas D. ecaudata is frequently pointed out as a bird-specialist. We assessed what prey D. ecaudata consumes in the Caatinga dry forests of northeastern Brazil  a highly modified biome. How the species would behave in a situation of scarcity of wild birds and increase in the availability of domestic animals? Could Diphylla have been induced to include also mammals in its diet? Using PCR-amplification of DNA fragments in the feces of D. ecaudata  we detected the regular consumption of chicken blood and human blood — a novel prey for this species. Our results suggest that the diet of D. ecaudata is more flexible than expected. The record of humans as prey and the absence of blood from native species may reflect a low availability of wild birds in the study site  reinforcing the impact of human activities on local ecological processes. This also opens a range of research possibilities on vampire bats in the Caatinga  both on the species' biology and the consequences for public health  considering the potential increase in the transmission of rabies in the region."

This provides the first broadband X-ray spectral analysis of the source  spanning nearly two decades in energy (0.5–30 keV). Previous X-ray observations of the source below 10 keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration on the basis of a pronounced iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray energy coverage of NuSTAR  together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing models  enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of the source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an obscuring column in excess of 3.6x10^24 cm−2  unconstrained at the upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2–10 keV luminosity of log10(L2) = 43.4 to 90% confidence  almost 400 times the observed flux  and consistent with various multiwavelength diagnostics. Such a high ratio of intrinsic to observed flux  in addition to an Fe-Kα fluorescence line equivalent width exceeding 2 keV  is extreme among known bona fide CTK AGNs  which we suggest are both due to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639. Our study demonstrates that broadband spectroscopic modeling with NuSTAR enables large corrections for obscuration to be carried out robustly and emphasizes the need for improved modeling of AGN tori showing intense iron fluorescence."

Recent research findings pointed out the important role of working memory for multitasking performance in general. To understand more about the role of working memory in predicting the speed and the error aspect of multitasking performance  this research was based on a newly developed and well-elaborated multidimensional model of working memory (Oberauer  Süß  Wilhelm  & Wittmann  2003). Its 3 dimensions are storage in the context of processing  coordination  and supervision. In addition  attention and reasoning were controlled when predicting multitasking speed and error. A multitasking scenario  a battery of working memory tests  a battery of reasoning tests  and 2 attention tests were administered to 135 participants. As expected working memory was the best predictor of multitasking performance  followed by reasoning and attention. Working memory components showed a differential validity when predicting multitasking speed and multitasking error: Multitasking speed was predicted mainly by coordination  and multitasking error mainly by storage in the context of processing. Thus  this study provided a deeper insight into the relevant abilities of multitasking. Implications for personnel selection are discussed."

The research was exploratory using a pragmatic  mixed method approach. Thirty University students participated; 10 psychologists  10 accountants and 10 mechanical engineers. The data collection tools used were: pre and post questionnaires  a working memory test  a flow state scale test  audio-visual data  web search logs  think aloud data  observation  and the critical decision method. All participants searched information on the Web for four topics: two for which they had prior knowledge and two more without prior knowledge. Perception of task complexity was found to be related to working memory. People with low working memory reported a significant increase in task complexity after they had completed information searching tasks for which they had no prior knowledge  this was not the case for tasks with prior knowledge. Regarding flow and task complexity  the results confirmed the suggestion of the PAT model (Finneran and Zhang  2003)  which proposed that a complex task can lead to anxiety and low flow levels as well as to perceived challenge and high flow levels. However  the results did not confirm the suggestion of the PAT model regarding the characteristics of web search systems and especially perceived vividness. All participants experienced high vividness. According to the PAT model  however  only people with high flow should experience high levels of vividness. Flow affected the degree of change of knowledge of the participants. People with high flow gained more knowledge for tasks without prior knowledge rather than people with low flow. Furthermore  accountants felt that tasks without prior knowledge were less complex at the end of the web seeking procedure than psychologists and mechanical engineers. Finally  the three disciplines appeared to differ regarding the multitasking information behaviour characteristics such as queries  web search sessions and opened tabs/windows."

It is shown that a static tractor beam can be generated using a single electrical driving signal  and a tractor beam with one-dimensional movement along the propagation direction can be created with two signals. Acoustic tractor beams capable of holding millimeter-sized polymer particles of density 1.25g/cm3 and fruit-flies (Drosophila) are demonstrated.

By monitoring the Raman peaks that arise from zone folding due to antiferromagnetic ordering at the transition temperature  we demonstrate that FePS3 exhibits an Ising-type antiferromagnetic ordering down to the monolayer limit  in good agreement with the Onsager solution for two-dimensional order–disorder transition. The transition temperature remains almost independent of the thickness from bulk to the monolayer limit with TN ∼ 118 K  indicating that the weak interlayer interaction has little effect on the antiferromagnetic ordering."

Anglo-American studies have shown a delay from 3 to 11years between the onset of pain symptoms and the final diagnosis of endometriosis. The aim of this study was to find the time difference between the onset of pelvic pain symptoms and the final diagnosis of endometriosis among Norwegian patients. Material and methods. Questionnaires were sent to 400 women  of whom 313 were members of the Norwegian Endometriosis Association and 87 were patients with endometriosis being hospitalized at St Olav's Hospital  Trondheim  in recent years. The response rate was 89%. Among the 356 questionnaires returned  95 were excluded as not fulfilling the inclusion criterion of surgically verified symptomatic endometriosis or incomplete questionnaires. Data were analyzed from 261 women  of whom 223 were members of the Norwegian Endometriosis Association. In all included patients  pain was an indication for diagnostic surgery. Results. The mean delay in diagnosis was 6.7±6.2years and the median delay was 5.0years for the two groups in total. There was no statistically significant difference in delay between the two recruitment groups. Mean delay in diagnosis had not changed significantly with time. Women reporting infertility in addition to pain did not have a significantly shorter delay. Conclusion. In Norway there is a considerable delay in the diagnosis of endometriosis  with figures comparable to results from Anglo-American studies. A greater awareness of symptoms of endometriosis and a more rapid investigation should thus be encouraged."

New technologies are now being developed that involve high-power lasers firing at 1 gram solar sails in near-Earth orbits  accelerating them to 20% the speed of light (c) within minutes. Although such an interstellar probe could reach Proxima 20 years after launch  without propellant to slow it down it would traverse the system within hours. Here we demonstrate how the stellar photon pressures of the stellar triple α Cen A  B  and C (Proxima) can be used together with gravity assists to decelerate incoming solar sails from Earth. The maximum injection speed at α Cen A to park a sail with a mass-to-surface ratio (σ) similar to graphene (7.6 × 10−4 gram m−2) in orbit around Proxima is about 13 800 km s−1 (4.6% c)  implying travel times from Earth to α Cen A and B of about 95 years and another 46 years (with a residual velocity of 1280 km s−1) to Proxima. The size of such a low-σ sail required to carry a payload of 10 grams is about 105 m2 = (316 m)2. Such a sail could use solar photons instead of an expensive laser system to gain interstellar velocities at departure. Photogravitational assists allow visits of three stellar systems and an Earth-sized potentially habitable planet in one shot  promising extremely high scientific yields."

Rather than a commercial long-distance aircraft  we used a military reconnaissance aircraft performing a circular flight at a constant altitude over the Korean Peninsula. At 9144 m (30 000 ft)  the mean and standard deviation of the radiation dose rate (among 35 measurements) was 2.3 and 0.17μSv/h  respectively. The experiment yielded two observational results. First  the dose rate changed over a flight time of 5–7h; second  no strong correlation was revealed between the cosmic rays observed from the ground-based neutron monitor and the radiation doses at aircraft altitude. These observations can provide insight into the short-term variation of cosmic radiation at aviation altitudes. When discarding various negligible factors  it is postulated that the changes in the geomagnetic field and the air density still could affect the variation of cosmic radiation at aircraft altitude. However  various factors are less known about the dependence on the cosmic radiation. Therefore  investigations of possible factors are also warranted at the monitoring points of space weather."

        "text": "Inflammation and vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) have been implicated in a number of conditions including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consistent with the inflammatory reflex termed the ‘cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway’  numerous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated negative associations between vmHRV and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP). The only prospective study  however  showed the opposite: higher CRP at baseline predicted higher high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) at follow-up. Thus  additional studies are needed to examine the prospective association between vmHRV and CRP. Methods: Healthy employees participated in a voluntary on-site health assessment. Blood samples and ambulatory heart rate recordings were obtained  and night-time HF-HRV was calculated. Useable heart rate data were available in 2007 for 106 nonsmoking employees (9% women; age 44.4 ± 8 years)  all of whom returned for an identical follow-up health assessment in 2011. Bootstrapped (500 replications) bivariate (r) and partial Pearson's correlations (ppc) adjusting for sex  age and body mass index at baseline (2007) were calculated. Results: Zero-order correlations indicated that higher HF-HRV was associated with lower levels of CRP at both time-points (2007: r = −0.19  P < 0.05; 2011: r = −0.34  P < 0.001). After adjustment  HF-HRV remained a significant predictor of CRP (ppc = −0.20  P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this study  we have provided in vivo support for the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in humans. Cardiac vagal modulation at baseline predicts level of CRP 4 years later. Our findings have important implications for the role of vmHRV as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Interventions targeted at vmHRV might be useful in the prevention of diseases associated with elevated systemic inflammation."

Overall ideal cardiovascular health incorporates 7 metrics  including the avoidance of overweight or obesity  a healthful diet  nonsmoking  and physical activity  total cholesterol  blood pressure  and fasting glucose at goal levels. Methods: This analysis of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study  a multicenter community-based study with 25 years of follow-up  included 2 932 participants aged 18 to 30 years at baseline (year 0) who attended follow-up examinations at years 7 and 25. Cardiovascular health metrics were measured at each examination. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)  modified Stroop test  and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) were completed at year 25. Results: A greater number of ideal cardiovascular metrics in young adulthood and middle age were independently associated with better cognitive function in midlife (p for trend < 0.01  for all). Specifically  each additional ideal metric was associated with 1.32 more symbols on the DSST (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93 – 1.71)  a 0.77-point lower interference score on the Stroop test (95% CI=−1.03 to −0.45)  and 0.12 more words on the RAVLT (95% CI = 0.04 to 0.20). Participants who had ≥5 ideal metrics at a greater number of the 3 examinations over the 25-year period exhibited better performance on each cognitive test in middle age (p for trend < 0.01  for all). Interpretation: Ideal cardiovascular health in young adulthood and its maintenance to middle age is associated with better psychomotor speed  executive function  and verbal memory in midlife."

        "text": "Extensive and well-preserved tracksites in the coastally exposed Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian–Barremian) Broome Sandstone of the Dampier Peninsula provide almost the entire fossil record of dinosaurs from the western half of the Australian continent. Tracks near the town of Broome were described in the late 1960s as Megalosauropus broomensis and attributed to a medium-sized theropod trackmaker. Brief reports in the early 1990s suggested the occurrence of at least another nine types of tracks  referable to theropod  sauropod  ornithopod  and thyreophoran trackmakers  at scattered tracksites spread over more than 80 km of coastline north of Broome  potentially representing one of the world's most diverse dinosaurian ichnofaunas. More recently  it has been proposed that this number could be as high as 16 and that the sites are spread over more than 200 km. However  the only substantial research that has been published on these more recent discoveries is a preliminary study of the sauropod tracks and an account of the ways in which the heavy passage of sauropod trackmakers may have shaped the Dampier Peninsula's Early Cretaceous landscape. With the other types of dinosaurian tracks in the Broome Sandstone remaining undescribed  and the full extent and nature of the Dampier Peninsula's dinosaurian tracksites yet to be adequately addressed  the overall scientific significance of the ichnofauna has remained enigmatic. At the request of the area's Goolarabooloo Traditional Custodians  400+ hours of ichnological survey work was undertaken from 2011 to 2016 on the 25 km stretch of coastline in the Yanijarri–Lurujarri section of the Dampier Peninsula  inclusive of the coastline at Walmadany (James Price Point). Forty-eight discrete dinosaurian tracksites were identified in this area  and thousands of tracks were examined and measured in situ and using three-dimensional photogrammetry. Tracksites were concentrated in three main areas along the coast: Yanijarri in the north  Walmadany in the middle  and Kardilakan–Jajal Buru in the south. Lithofacies analysis revealed 16 repeated facies types that occurred in three distinctive lithofacies associations  indicative of an environmental transgression between the distal fluvial to deltaic portions of a large braid plain  with migrating sand bodies and periodic sheet floods. The main dinosaurian track-bearing horizons seem to have been generated between periodic sheet floods that blanketed the preexisting sand bodies within the braid plain portion of a tidally influenced delta  with much of the original  gently undulating topography now preserved over large expanses of the present day intertidal reef system. Of the tracks examined  150 could be identified and are assignable to a least eleven and possibly as many as 21 different track types: five different types of theropod tracks  at least six types of sauropod tracks  four types of ornithopod tracks  and six types of thyreophoran tracks. Eleven of these track types can formally be assigned or compared to existing or new ichnotaxa  whereas the remaining ten represent morphotypes that  although distinct  are currently too poorly represented to confidently assign to existing or new ichnotaxa. Among the ichnotaxa that we have recognized  only two (Megalosauropus broomensis and Wintonopus latomorum) belong to existing ichnotaxa  and two compare to existing ichnotaxa but display a suite of morphological features suggesting that they may be distinct in their own right and are therefore placed in open nomenclature. Six of the ichnotaxa that we have identified are new: one theropod ichnotaxon  Yangtzepus clarkei  ichnosp. nov.; one sauropod ichnotaxon  Oobardjidama foulkesi  ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov.; two ornithopod ichnotaxa  Wintonopus middletonae  ichnosp. nov.  and Walmadanyichnus hunteri  ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov.; and two thyreophoran ichnotaxa  Garbina roeorum  ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov.  and Luluichnus mueckei  ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov. The level of diversity of the main track types is comparable across areas where tracksites are concentrated: Kardilakan–Jajal Buru (12)  Walmadany (11)  and Yanijarri (10).The overall diversity of the dinosaurian ichnofauna of the Broome Sandstone in the Yanijarri–Lurujarri section of the Dampier Peninsula is unparalleled in Australia  and even globally. In addition to being the primary record of non-avian dinosaurs in the western half of Australia  this ichnofauna provides our only detailed glimpse of Australia's dinosaurian fauna during the first half of the Early Cretaceous. It indicates that the general composition of Australia's mid-Cretaceous dinosaurian fauna was already in place by the Valanginian–Barremian. Both sauropods and ornithopods were diverse and abundant  and thyreophorans were the only type of quadrupedal ornithischians. Important aspects of the fauna that are not seen in the Australian mid-Cretaceous body fossil record are the presence of stegosaurians  an overall higher diversity of thyreophorans and theropods  and the presence of large-bodied hadrosauroid-like ornithopods and very large-bodied sauropods. In many respects  these differences suggest a holdover from the Late Jurassic  when the majority of dinosaurian clades had a more cosmopolitan distribution prior to the fragmentation of Pangea. Although the record for the Lower Cretaceous of Gondwana is sparse  a similar mix of taxa occurs in the Barremian–lower Aptian La Amarga Formation of Argentina and the Berriasian–Hauterivian Kirkwood Formation of South Africa. The persistence of this fauna across the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary in South America  Africa  and Australia might be characteristic of Gondwanan dinosaurian faunas more broadly. It suggests that the extinction event that affected Laurasian dinosaurian faunas across the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary may not have been as extreme in Gondwana  and this difference may have foreshadowed the onset of Laurasian-Eurogondwanan provincialism. The disappearance of stegosaurians and the apparent drop in diversity of theropods by the mid-Cretaceous suggests that  similar to South America  Australia passed through a period of faunal turnover between the Valanginian and Aptian."

In particular  Terror Management Theory’s worldview defence hypothesis predicts that death anxiety is lowest among very religious and irreligious individuals  and highest among uncertain individuals. Likewise  the supposition that death anxiety motivates religious belief  which in turn mitigates death anxiety  predicts that religiosity increases with death anxiety among non-believers  and that death anxiety decreases as religiosity increases among believers. In both cases  a curvilinear relationship – specifically  an inverted-U curve – is predicted. We extracted 202 effect sizes from 100 studies for an “omnibus” religiosity meta-analysis  and six meta-analyses that examine particular dimensions of religiosity. We found high heterogeneity and a weak negative association between death anxiety and religiosity. A closer examination revealed that 10 of the 11 studies that directly tested for curvilinearity provided some support for an inverted-U pattern. The curvilinearity hypothesis cannot be ruled out  but more evidence – particularly on non-religious individuals  and in non-Western  non-Abrahamic contexts – is needed."

Trends in Kidney Transplantation: In general  2014 extended major trends in solid organ transplantation seen over the past decade. The organ most commonly transplanted in the US is the kidney. More candidates were added to the kidney transplant waiting list than underwent transplant. In 2014  the number of candidates on the kidney transplant waiting list continued to grow  while the total number of kidney transplants remained relatively flat. Over the decade from 2005 to 2014  the number of candidates on the kidney transplant waiting list increased by 28.9% (Figure INT 1)  the number of candidates added to the list increased by 21.2% (Figure INT 2)  and the number of transplants increased by only 2.5% (Figure INT 3). This increase in the number of kidney transplants reflects a 13.5% increase in transplants of deceased donor kidneys from 2005 to 2014  but at the same time living donor transplants declined by 15.8% (see Figure KI 4.1 in the Kidney chapter). Reasons for the decline in living donor transplants are probably multiple  but could include economic disincentives in times of economic hardship  as well as the publication of recent studies on long-term outcomes of living kidney donors. Despite the shortage of deceased donor kidneys  the number of kidneys removed for transplant but not transplanted (“discarded”) grew by 12.3% from 2005 to 2014."

A central issue in developing such artificial materials is to understand and control the interlayer electron transfer process  which plays a key role in harnessing their emergent properties. Recent photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements revealed that the electron transfer in heterobilayers occurs on ultrafast time scales. However  there is still a lack of fundamental understanding on how this process can be so efficient at van der Waals interfaces. Here we show evidence suggesting the coherent nature of such interlayer electron transfer. In a trilayer of MoS2–WS2–MoSe2  electrons excited in MoSe2 transfer to MoS2 in about one picosecond. Surprisingly  these electrons do not populate the middle WS2 layer during this process. Calculations showed the coherent nature of the charge transfer and reproduced the measured electron transfer time. The hole transfer from MoS2 to MoSe2 is also found to be efficient and ultrafast. The separation of electrons and holes extends their lifetimes to more than one nanosecond  suggesting potential applications of such multilayer structures in optoelectronics."

Two substances  androstadienone (AND) and estratetraenol (EST)  were recently reported to signal male and female gender  respectively  potentially qualifying them as human sex pheromones. If AND and EST truly signal gender  then they should affect reproductively relevant behaviours such as mate perception. To test this hypothesis  heterosexual  Caucasian human participants completed two computer-based tasks twice  on two consecutive days  exposed to a control scent on one day and a putative pheromone (AND or EST) on the other. In the first task  46 participants (24 male  22 female) indicated the gender (male or female) of five gender-neutral facial morphs. Exposure to AND or EST had no effect on gender perception. In the second task  94 participants (43 male  51 female) rated photographs of opposite-sex faces for attractiveness and probable sexual unfaithfulness. Exposure to the putative pheromones had no effect on either attractiveness or unfaithfulness ratings. These results are consistent with those of other experimental studies and reviews that suggest AND and EST are unlikely to be human pheromones. The double-blind nature of the current study lends increased support to this conclusion. If human sex pheromones affect our judgements of gender  attractiveness or unfaithfulness from faces  they are unlikely to be AND or EST."

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if PD involves dysbiosis of gut microbiome  disentangle effects of confounders  and identify candidate taxa and functional pathways to guide research. Methods: A total of 197 PD cases and 130 controls were studied. Microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from stool. Metadata were collected on 39 potential confounders including medications  diet  gastrointestinal symptoms  and demographics. Statistical analyses were conducted while controlling for potential confounders and correcting for multiple testing. We tested differences in the overall microbial composition  taxa abundance  and functional pathways. Results: Independent microbial signatures were detected for PD (P = 4E-5)  participants' region of residence within the United States (P = 3E-3)  age (P = 0.03)  sex (P = 1E-3)  and dietary fruits/vegetables (P = 0.01). Among patients  independent signals were detected for catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors (P = 4E-4)  anticholinergics (P = 5E-3)  and possibly carbidopa/levodopa (P = 0.05). We found significantly altered abundances of the Bifidobacteriaceae  Christensenellaceae  [Tissierellaceae]  Lachnospiraceae  Lactobacillaceae  Pasteurellaceae  and Verrucomicrobiaceae families. Functional predictions revealed changes in numerous pathways  including the metabolism of plant-derived compounds and xenobiotics degradation. Conclusion: PD is accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Results coalesce divergent findings of prior studies  reveal altered abundance of several taxa  nominate functional pathways  and demonstrate independent effects of PD medications on the microbiome. The findings provide new leads and testable hypotheses on the pathophysiology and treatment of PD. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society"

Because nuclear power is an abundant  low-carbon source of base-load power  it could make a large contribution to mitigation of global climate change and air pollution. Using historical production data  we calculate that global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning. On the basis of global projection data that take into account the effects of the Fukushima accident  we find that nuclear power could additionally prevent an average of 420000–7.04 million deaths and 80–240 GtCO2-eq emissions due to fossil fuels by midcentury  depending on which fuel it replaces. By contrast  we assess that large-scale expansion of unconstrained natural gas use would not mitigate the climate problem and would cause far more deaths than expansion of nuclear power."

Over two decades later  this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder  refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology  were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n=12) or inactive placebo (n=8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale  administered at baseline  4 days after each experimental session  and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing  blood pressure  and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up  placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events  adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm  and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments."

The flow of denser  more-saline water through the culverts from the north arm (Gunnison Bay) to the south arm (Gilbert Bay) previously drove the perennial stratification of the south arm and the existence of oxic shallow brine and anoxic deep brine layers. Closure of the causeway culverts occurred concurrently with a multiyear drought that resulted in a decrease in the lake elevation and a concomitant increase in top-down erosion of the upper surface of the deep brine layer by wind-forced mixing. The combination of these events resulted in the replacement of the formerly stratified water column in the south arm with one that was vertically homogeneous and oxic. Total mercury concentrations in the deep waters of the south arm decreased by approximately 81% and methylmercury concentrations in deep waters decreased by roughly 86% due to destratification. Methylmercury concentrations decreased by 77% in underlying surficial sediment  whereas there was no change observed in total mercury. The dramatic mercury loss from deep waters and methylmercury loss from underlying sediment in response to causeway sealing provides new understanding of the potential role of the deep brine layer in the accumulation and persistence of methylmercury in the Great Salt Lake. Additional mercury measurements in biota appear to contradict the previously implied connection between elevated methylmercury concentrations in the deep brine layer and elevated mercury in avian species reported prior to causeway sealing."

However  variations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet formation and evolution. Here we present a new code  the Highly Eccentric Rotating Concentric U (potential) Layers Equilibrium Structure (HERCULES) code  that solves for the equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping constant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code  we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of morphologies. For any rotating planetary body  there is a thermal limit beyond which the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital velocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL)  a hot planetary body forms a structure  which we name a synestia  with a corotating inner region connected to a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and models of planet formation  we show that typical rocky planets are substantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected angular momentum of growing planets  a large fraction of post-impact bodies will exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot  rotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation and the properties of the final planets. In particular  the structure of post-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion  core formation  and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms for satellite formation. Finally  the wide variety of possible structures for terrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets."

In two experiments we explored the developmental time course of the ability to discriminate between direct and averted gaze  a task thought to involve cortical information processing of faces. We found that (a) infants as young as four months could discriminate between direct and averted gaze  (b) this ability was not due to the development of low-level visual processes  and (c) younger infants did not show reliable evidence of gaze discrimination. In an additional experiment we tested adults to study the effect of face context on the ability to discriminate gaze direction. Adult subjects were more sensitive in this discrimination when the eyes were in the context of an upright face than when the eyes were in either an inverted face or in a scrambled face. Taken together  these results suggest that the mechanisms underlying gaze detection may be mediated by cortical circuits also involved in other aspects of face recognition."

The first ever self-fueled pump is illustrated as one of its typical practical utilizations. Synthetic self-fueled motors  which can spontaneously convert chemical energy into mechanical activity to induce autonomous locomotion  are excellent candidates for making self-powered machines  detectors/sensors  and novel robots. Here  we show an extraordinary self-propulsion of new synthetic motors based on liquid metal objects in milli-/centimeter scale. Such motors swim in a circular Petri dish or different structured channels containing aqueous solution with a pretty high velocity on the order of centimeters per second  and surprising lifetime lasts for more than 1 h without any assistance of external energy. The soft material liquid metal enables the motors to self-deform  which makes them highly adaptable for accomplishing tough missions in special environment. Interestingly  the motors work just like biomimetic mollusk since they closely resemble the nature by “eating” aluminum as “food”  and can change shape by closely conforming to the geometrical space it voyages in. A self-powered pump is thus achieved based on the actuation of the liquid metal-enabled motor. Further  such pump can also be conceived to work as a cooler. Apart from different geometrical channels  several dominate factors  including the volume of the motor  the amount of aluminum  the property of the solution  and the material of the substrate etc.  have been demonstrated that they infl uence the performance of the autonomous locomotion evidently.

We present the first quantitative evidence for large  regional-scale early winter respiration flux  which more than offsets carbon uptake in summer in the Arctic. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Barrow station indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73% since 1975  supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2. It has been known for over 50 y that tundra soils remain unfrozen and biologically active in early winter  yet many Earth System Models do not correctly represent this phenomenon or the associated CO2 emissions  and hence they underestimate current  and likely future  CO2 emissions under climate change. Abstract: High-latitude ecosystems have the capacity to release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in response to increasing temperatures  representing a potentially significant positive feedback within the climate system. Here  we combine aircraft and tower observations of atmospheric CO2 with remote sensing data and meteorological products to derive temporally and spatially resolved year-round CO2 fluxes across Alaska during 2012–2014. We find that tundra ecosystems were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere annually  with especially high rates of respiration during early winter (October through December). Long-term records at Barrow  AK  suggest that CO2 emission rates from North Slope tundra have increased during the October through December period by 73% ± 11% since 1975  and are correlated with rising summer temperatures. Together  these results imply increasing early winter respiration and net annual emission of CO2 in Alaska  in response to climate warming. Our results provide evidence that the decadal-scale increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle may be linked with increasing biogenic emissions in the Arctic  following the growing season. Early winter respiration was not well simulated by the Earth System Models used to forecast future carbon fluxes in recent climate assessments. Therefore  these assessments may underestimate the carbon release from Arctic soils in response to a warming climate."

PRDs have exceptional strength properties: the head of a PRD can withstand impact with a small hammer  or compression between tungsten carbide platens to high loads of ∼15000N  but the tail can be broken with just finger pressure leading to catastrophic disintegration of the PRD. We show here that the high strength of a PRD comes from large surface compressive stresses in the range of 400–700MPa  determined using techniques of integrated photoelasticity. The surface compressive stresses can suppress Hertzian cone cracking during impact with a small hammer or compression between platens. Finally  it is argued that when the compressive force on a PRD is very high  plasticity in the PRD occurs  which leads to its eventual destruction with increasing load."

Setting and participants 64714 women in the Nurses’ Health Study and 45303 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study without a history of coronary heart disease who completed a 131 item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1986 that was updated every four years through 2010. Exposure Consumption of gluten  estimated from food frequency questionnaires. Main outcome measure Development of coronary heart disease (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction). Results During 26 years of follow-up encompassing 2273931 person years  2431 women and 4098 men developed coronary heart disease. Compared with participants in the lowest fifth of gluten intake  who had a coronary heart disease incidence rate of 352 per 100000 person years  those in the highest fifth had a rate of 277 events per 100000 person years  leading to an unadjusted rate difference of 75 (95% confidence interval 51 to 98) fewer cases of coronary heart disease per 100000 person years. After adjustment for known risk factors  participants in the highest fifth of estimated gluten intake had a multivariable hazard ratio for coronary heart disease of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.02; P for trend=0.29). After additional adjustment for intake of whole grains (leaving the remaining variance of gluten corresponding to refined grains)  the multivariate hazard ratio was 1.00 (0.92 to 1.09; P for trend=0.77). In contrast  after additional adjustment for intake of refined grains (leaving the variance of gluten intake correlating with whole grain intake)  estimated gluten consumption was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (multivariate hazard ratio 0.85  0.77 to 0.93; P for trend=0.002). Conclusion Long term dietary intake of gluten was not associated with risk of coronary heart disease. However  the avoidance of gluten may result in reduced consumption of beneficial whole grains  which may affect cardiovascular risk. The promotion of gluten-free diets among people without celiac disease should not be encouraged."

This heterogeneity can consist of marine ice  meteoric ice with modified rheological properties  or the presence of fractures. Here  we use radar observations on the Larsen C Ice Shelf  Antarctica  to investigate (i) the termination of a 25km long rift in the Churchill Peninsula suture zone  which was found to contain ~60m of accreted marine ice  and (ii) the along-flow evolution of a suture zone originating at Cole Peninsula. We determine a steady state field of basal melting/freezing rates and apply it to a flowline model to delineate the along-flow evolution of layers within the ice shelf. The thickening surface wedge of locally accumulated meteoric ice  which likely has limited lateral variation in its mechanical properties  accounts for ~60% of the total ice thickness near the calving front. Thus  we infer that the lower ~40% of the ice column and the material heterogeneities present there are responsible for resisting fracture propagation and thereby delaying tabular calving events  as demonstrated in the >40year time series leading up to the 2004/2005 calving event for Larsen C. This likely represents a highly sensitive aspect of ice shelf stability  as changes in the oceanic forcing may lead to the loss of this heterogeneity."

Method Published studies that enrolled adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were identified by searches of Medline and Embase  and by manual searches of medical journals. All authors were contacted for IPD. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the association of SE presence  dose  and genotype with rheumatoid vasculitis. Result A total of 14 studies and 1 568 patients (129 with vasculitis) were included in the analysis. RA patients with vasculitis were significantly more likely to have rheumatoid nodules (odds ratio [OR] 2.5  95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.5–3.9]  but there was no significant association with male sex  rheumatoid factor positivity  or erosive disease. No significant association was observed between the presence of the SE (i.e.  1 or 2 alleles versus 0 alleles) and rheumatoid vasculitis (summary OR 1.4  95% CI 0.7–2.7). Analysis by SE genotype  however  demonstrated a striking relationship of vasculitis to 3 genotypes containing a double dose of the SE  specifically HLA–DRB1*0401/*0401 (OR 6.2  95% CI 1.01–37.9)  *0401/*0404 (OR 4.1  95% CI 1.1–16.2)  and *0101/*0401 (OR 4.0  95% CI 1.4–11.6). Conclusion The HLA–DRB1 SE genotypes *0401/*0401  *0401/*0404  and *0101/*0401 may be of particular importance to rheumatoid vasculitis. It is hoped that additional investigation of these and other SE genotypes will lead to improved insight into the mechanisms influencing the clinical expression of RA."

Here  another strategy for improving the kinetics of layered transition metal oxides by the presence of structural water is proposed. To investigate this strategy  the electrochemical energy storage behavior of a model hydrated layered oxide  WO3·2H2O  is compared with that of anhydrous WO3 in an acidic electrolyte. It is found that the presence of structural water leads to a transition from battery-like behavior in the anhydrous WO3 to ideally pseudocapacitive behavior in WO3·2H2O. As a result  WO3·2H2O exhibits significantly improved capacity retention and energy efficiency for proton storage over WO3 at sweep rates as fast as 200 mV s–1  corresponding to charge/discharge times of just a few seconds. Importantly  the energy storage of WO3·2H2O at such rates is nearly 100% efficient  unlike in the case of anhydrous WO3. Pseudocapacitance in WO3·2H2O allows for high-mass loading electrodes (>3 mg cm–2) and high areal capacitances (>0.25 F cm–2 at 200 mV s–1) with simple slurry-cast electrodes. These results demonstrate a new approach for developing pseudocapacitance in layered transition metal oxides for high-power energy storage  as well as the importance of energy efficiency as a metric of performance of pseudocapacitive materials"

This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system  as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss  so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface  where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed  it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels  by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate  concluding that deployment over 10% of the Arctic  especially where ice survival is marginal  could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic  using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multipronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system."

Resistance of some pathogens to conventional disinfectants can require the combination of multiple disinfectants or increased disinfectant doses  which may produce harmful byproducts. Here  we describe an efficient method for disinfecting Escherichia coli and removing the bacteria from contaminated water using water self-propelled Janus microbots decorated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The structure of a spherical Janus microbot consists of a magnesium (Mg) microparticle as a template that also functions as propulsion source by producing hydrogen bubbles when in contact with water  an inner iron (Fe) magnetic layer for their remote guidance and collection  and an outer AgNP-coated gold (Au) layer for bacterial adhesion and improving bactericidal properties. The active motion of microbots increases the chances of the contact of AgNPs on the microbot surface with bacteria  which provokes the selective Ag+ release in their cytoplasm  and the microbot self-propulsion increases the diffusion of the released Ag+ ions. In addition  the AgNP-coated Au cap of the microbots has a dual capability of capturing bacteria and then killing them. Thus  we have demonstrated that AgNP-coated Janus microbots are capable of efficiently killing more than 80% of E. coli compared with colloidal AgNPs that killed only less than 35% of E. coli in contaminated water solutions in 15 min. After capture and extermination of bacteria  magnetic properties of the cap allow collection of microbots from water along with the captured dead bacteria  leaving water with no biological contaminants. The presented biocompatible Janus microbots offer an encouraging method for rapid disinfection of water."

This expansion appears to be determined largely by anthropogenic drivers—notably rises in greenhouse gases. Of greatest concern is the poleward shift of the dry sub-tropical zone into highly populated regions that have generally enjoyed a more temperate climate. While the effects of latitudinal shifts of climate zones will be most severe in temperate regions outside the tropics  there will also be significant changes in climate within the tropics—notably unprecedented thermal conditions for hundreds of millions of people  along with projections for more extreme weather events. Australia's geographical location makes it particularly vulnerable to an expanding tropics. As the tropics expand poleward  more of southern Australia will be influenced by the dry sub-tropical zone and associated reductions in winter rainfall. These drying trends are projected to continue over most southern parts of Australia this century  accompanied by rising temperatures and more hot days. Future rainfall trends for northern Australia remain uncertain  but there is an expected significant increase in the number of hot days  together with more extreme weather events. Future climate change in northern Australia has been ignored by the White Paper for the Development of Northern Australia (2015)  bringing into serious question the feasibility and affordability of many of the development policies  plans  and projects promulgated in the White Paper. Even without climate change  the north faces many significant environmental and economic challenges for its future development."

In Mexico City  house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests  which reduces the amount of ectoparasites  but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents. Yet  the reason for this behaviour is unknown. One possibility is that birds extract the cellulose fibres from discarded butts simply because they resemble feathers. Alternatively  disassembled cigarette butts may be brought to the nests because they repel ectoparasites. Here we tested the latter hypothesis by assessing whether house finches Carpodacus mexicanus increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a raise in ectoparasite load. When present  fibres from butts are concentrated in the nest lining. By taking it away  we simultaneously removed most of the butt material and collected the bulk of the tick population infesting each nest  as these parasites cluster in the lining. We removed the bedding of nests when chicks had recently hatched  and randomly assigned each nests to one of the following treatments: 1) addition of live ticks  2) addition of dead ticks and 3) simulation of tick addition. Females in the live ticks’ treatment added more butt fibres to their nests than parents in control treatments. Additionally  the amount of butt fibres in the original lining also predicted the amount of fibres added after the manipulation. It seems that the tendency to bring to the nest cigarette butts is at least partially a response to current  and perhaps also past  parasite load."

Birds have been shown to adapt their vocalizations  use of nesting places and activity rhythms to the urban environments  and we have previously reported that some species  including the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus)  use cellulose from smoked cigarette butts as lining material and thus reduce the number of ectoparasites in their nests  probably because the nicotine repels arthropods. Nicotine is only one of hundreds of potentially harmful substances found in cigarette butts. Here  we investigated whether the presence of such chemicals is harmful for house finches adding cigarette butts to their nests. We found that hatching and fledging success and chick immune response were all positively correlated to the proportion of the nest that was made up of butts. However  the signs of genotoxicity in the blood cells also increased with the proportion of butt cellulose in the nests. Although we have not measured the effect of genotoxicity on post-fledging survival and breeding success  it seems that bringing cigarette butts to the nest has negative consequences that may counterbalance the benefits of using them as ectoparasites repellents."

The TTC values are based on known structure–activity relationships and do not require chemical-specific toxicity data. This allows safety assessment (or prioritization for testing) of chemicals with known molecular structure but little or no toxicity data. Recently  the TTC concept was extended to inhaled substances by converting a TTC expressed in micrograms per person per day to an airborne concentration (ng/m3)  making allowance for intake by routes in addition to inhalation and implicitly assuming 100% bioavailability of inhaled toxicants. The resulting concentration of no toxicologic concern (CoNTC)  30 ng/m3  represents a generic airborne concentration that is expected to pose no hazard to humans exposed continuously throughout a 70-yr lifetime. Published data on the levels of mycotoxins in agricultural dusts or in fungal spores  along with measured levels of airborne mycotoxins  spores  or dust in various environments  were used to identify conditions under which mycotoxin exposures might reach the CoNTC. Data demonstrate that airborne concentrations of dusts and mold spores sometimes encountered in agricultural environments have the potential to produce mycotoxin concentrations greater than the CoNTC. On the other hand  these data suggest that common exposures to mycotoxins from airborne molds in daily life  including in the built indoor environment  are below the concentration of no toxicologic concern."

In this study the contributions of copy number variation  exposure to air pollutants  and the interaction between the two on autism risk  were evaluated in the population-based case-control Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) Study. For the current investigation  we included only those CHARGE children (a) who met criteria for autism or typical development and (b) for whom our team had conducted both genetic evaluation of copy number burden and determination of environmental air pollution exposures based on mapping addresses from the pregnancy and early childhood. This sample consisted of 158 cases of children with autism and 147 controls with typical development. Multiple logistic regression models were fit with and without environmental variable-copy number burden interactions. We found no correlation between average air pollution exposure from conception to age 2 years and the child's CNV burden. We found a significant interaction in which a 1SD increase in duplication burden combined with a 1SD increase in ozone exposure was associated with an elevated autism risk (OR 3.4  P<0.005) much greater than the increased risks associated with either genomic duplication (OR 1.85  95% CI 1.25–2.73) or ozone (OR 1.20  95% CI 0.93–1.54) alone. Similar results were obtained when CNV and ozone were dichotomized to compare those in the top quartile relative to those having a smaller CNV burden and lower exposure to ozone  and when exposures were assessed separately for pregnancy  the first year of life  and the second year of life. No interactions were observed for other air pollutants  even those that demonstrated main effects; ozone tends to be negatively correlated with the other pollutants examined. While earlier work has demonstrated interactions between the presence of a pathogenic CNV and an environmental exposure [Webb et al.  2016]  these findings appear to be the first indication that global copy number variation may increase susceptibility to certain environmental factors  and underscore the need to consider both genomics and environmental exposures as well as the mechanisms by which each may amplify the risks for autism associated with the other.

Graphene aerogels have emerged as attractive candidates. Despite recent progresses  the bottleneck remains how to simultaneously achieve both strength and resilience. While multiscale architecture designs may offer a possible route  the difficulty lies in the lack of design guidelines and how to experimentally achieve the necessary structure control over multiple length scales. The latter is even more challenging when manufacturing scalability is taken into account. The Thalia dealbata stem is a naturally porous material that is lightweight  strong  and resilient  owing to its architecture with three-dimensional (3D) interconnected lamellar layers. Inspired by such  we assemble graphene oxide (GO) sheets into a similar architecture using a bidirectional freezing technique. Subsequent freeze-drying and thermal reduction results in graphene aerogels with highly tunable 3D architectures  consequently an unusual combination of strength and resilience. With their additional electrical conductivity  these graphene aerogels are potentially useful for mechanically switchable electronics. Beyond such  our study establishes bidirectional freezing as a general method to achieve multiscale architectural control in a scalable manner that can be extended to many other material systems."

However  the recent observation of l -mmollL levels of brain j3-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in children on the ketogenic diet suggests otherwise. The authors report the measurement of brain BHB and lactate in the occipital lobe of healthy adults using high field (4-T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy  measured in the nonfasted state and after 2- and 3-day fasting-induced ketosis. A 9-mL voxel located in the calcarine fissure was studied  detecting the BHB and lactate upfield resonances using a I H homonuclear editing sequence. Plasma BHB levels also were measured. Themean brain BHB concentration increased from a nonfasted level of 0.05 ± 0.05 to 0.60 ± 0.26 mmollL (after second day of fasting)  increasing further to 0.98 ± 0.16 mmollL (after the third day of fasting). The mean nonfasted brain lactate was 0.69 ± 0. 17 mmol/L  increasing to 1.47 ± 0.22 mmollL after the third day. The plasma and brain BHB levels correlated well (r = 0.86) with a brain-plasma slope of 0.26. These data show that brain BHB rises significantly with 2- and 3-day fasting-induced ketosis. The lactate increase likely results from ketones displacing lactate oxidation without altering glucose phosphorylation and glycolysis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 15 months of ketogenic diet treatment on growth and REE in children with intractable epilepsy. Method Growth  body composition  and REE were assessed at baseline  3 months and 15 months in 24 children (14 males  10 females; mean age 5y 6mo [SD 26mo]  range 7mo–6y 5mo)  10 with cerebral palsy [CP]). Fifteen were identified as ketogenic diet responders at 3 months and continued on the ketogenic diet until 15 months. These were compared to 75 healthy children (43 males  32 females; mean age 6y 3mo [SD 21mo] age range 2–9y). REE was expressed as percentage predicted  growth as height (HAz) and weight (WAz) z-scores  and body composition as fat and fat free mass (FFM). Results HAz declined −0.2 and −0.6 from baseline to 3 months and 15 months respectively (p=0.001)  while WAz was unchanged. In ketogenic diet responders  FFM  age and CP diagnosis predicted REE (overall R2=0.76  p<0.001) and REE did not change. REE adjusted for FFM was lower (p<0.01) in children with CP at baseline (mean [standard error]  −143[51] kcals/d) and 15 months (−198[53] kcals/d) compared to the healthy children. Interpretation After 15 months of the ketogenic diet  linear growth status declined while weight status and REE were unchanged. REE remained reduced in children with CP. What this paper adds Linear growth declines in children with intractable epilepsy treated with the ketogenic diet for 15 months. REE (resting energy expenditure) is not affected by long-term ketogenic diet treatment. REE in children with intractable epilepsy and CP is reduced before and after ketogenic diet treatment"

Methods: A questionnaire was designed to discern the attitude of orthopaedic consultants and residents to the technical challenges of performing knee arthroscopy and the possible role of robotically enhanced surgery. The questionnaire included 31 questions across five key domains. Results: Iatrogenic damage to articular cartilage was thought to occur in at least 1 in 10 cases by 50% of respondents with 15% believing that it occurred in every case. One hundred or more procedures were thought to be necessary to overcome the learning curve by 40% of respondents and 77.5% believed that 50 procedures or above were necessary. Ninety-nine per cent of respondents agreed that higher technical skills would decrease unintended damage. Despite such difficulties with the procedure and no prior experience with robotic surgery  47% of respondents see a role for semiautonomous arthroscopic systems in the future. Conclusions: Surgeons believe that knee arthroscopy is a difficult procedure with a long learning curve and a high incidence of iatrogenic cartilage damage. Many find it ergonomically challenging and have frustration with current tools and technology. Clinical Relevance: This is the first study that highlights surgeons’ difficulties performing knee arthroscopy despite the commonly held attitudes that it is a straightforward procedure. Systems that are able to decrease these problems should improve patients’ outcomes and decrease the risk of harm."

Environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies have been based on observations of birds before the construction of wind farms. We analysed data from 53 EIAs in relation to the actual recorded bird mortalities at 20 fully installed wind farms to determine whether this method is accurate in predicting the risk of new wind farm installations. Bird data from EIAs were compared with bird collisions per turbine and year at functional post-constructed wind farms to identify any relationship between pre- and post-construction studies. Significant differences in birds recorded flying among the 53 proposed wind farms were found by the EIAs. Similar results were obtained when only griffon vultures Gyps fulvus and other raptors were considered. There were significant differences in indexes  including the relative index of breeding birds close to proposed locations  among the 53 proposed wind farm sites. The collision rate of birds with turbines was one of the highest ever recorded for raptors  and the griffon vulture was the most frequently killed species. Bird mortality varied among the 20 constructed wind farms. No relationship between variables predicting risk from EIAs and actual recorded mortality was found. A weak relationship was found between griffon vulture and kestrel Falco sp. mortality and the numbers of these two species crossing the area. Synthesis and applications. There was no clear relationship between predicted risk and the actual recorded bird mortality at wind farms. Risk assessment studies incorrectly assumed a linear relationship between frequency of observed birds and fatalities. Nevertheless  it is known that bird mortality in wind farms is related to physical characteristics around individual wind turbines. However  EIAs are usually conducted at the scale of the entire wind farm. The correlation between predicted mortality and actual mortality must be improved in future risk assessment studies by changing the scale of these studies to focus on the locations of proposed individual wind turbine sites and working on a species specific level."

In their study  participants (N = 42) who were randomly assigned to briefly adopt expansive  powerful postures sought more risk  had higher testosterone levels  and had lower cortisol levels than those randomly assigned to adopt contractive  powerless postures. This result has led some individuals to recommend power posing as a way to improve performance and life outcomes (e.g.  Blodget  2013; Cuddy  2012). Despite the attention Carney et al.’s (2010) study has received  there had until recently been no attempts to closely replicate its methods. Ranehill et al. (2015)  using a larger sample (N = 200) and similar but not identical procedures  found that although adopting powerful postures led to self-reported increases in feelings of power (thus verifying the effectiveness of Carney et al.’s manipulation)  it did not affect participants’ behavior or hormonal levels.1 In their response to the failed replication  Carney  Cuddy  and Yap (2015) reviewed 33 successful studies investigating the effects of expansive versus contractive posing  focusing on differences between these studies and the failed replication to identify possible moderators that future studies could explore. But before spending valuable resources on that  it is useful to establish whether the literature that Carney et al. (2015) cited actually suggests that power posing is effective. It may seem that the existence of 33 supportive published studies is enough to conclude that there is an effect of expansive versus contractive posture on psychological outcomes. However  one needs to account for selective reporting. If results get published only when they show an effect  the fact that all the published evidence shows an effect is not diagnostic (see  e.g.  Pashler & Harris  2012)."

We hypothesize that an upward-spiral dynamic continually reinforces the tie between positive emotions and physical health and that this spiral is mediated by people’s perceptions of their positive social connections. We tested this overarching hypothesis in a longitudinal field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group that self-generated positive emotions via loving-kindness meditation or to a waiting-list control group. Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions relative to those in the control group  an effect moderated by baseline vagal tone  a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions  in turn  produced increases in vagal tone  an effect mediated by increased perceptions of social connections. This experimental evidence identifies one mechanism—perceptions of social connections—through which positive emotions build physical health  indexed as vagal tone. Results suggest that positive emotions  positive social connections  and physical health influence one another in a self-sustaining upward-spiral dynamic."

Although effective psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD exist  clients with PTSD report additional benefits of complementary and alternative approaches such as yoga. In particular  yoga may downregulate the stress response and positively impact PTSD and comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. We conducted a pilot study of a randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-session Kripalu-based yoga intervention with an assessment control group. Participants included 38 women with current full or subthreshold PTSD symptoms. During the intervention  yoga participants showed decreases in reexperiencing and hyperarousal symptoms. The assessment control group  however  showed decreases in reexperiencing and anxiety symptoms as well  which may be a result of the positive effect of self-monitoring on PTSD and associated symptoms. Between-groups effect sizes were small to moderate (0.08–0.31). Although more research is needed  yoga may be an effective adjunctive treatment for PTSD. Participants responded positively to the intervention  suggesting that it was tolerable for this sample. Findings underscore the need for future research investigating mechanisms by which yoga may impact mental health symptoms  gender comparisons  and the long-term effects of yoga practice."

Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at study endpoint (2012-15). Setting Community dwelling adults enrolled in the Whitehall II cohort based in the UK (the Whitehall II imaging substudy). Participants 550 men and women with mean age 43.0 (SD 5.4) at study baseline  none were “alcohol dependent” according to the CAGE screening questionnaire  and all safe to undergo MRI of the brain at follow-up. Twenty three were excluded because of incomplete or poor quality imaging data or gross structural abnormality (such as a brain cyst) or incomplete alcohol use  sociodemographic  health  or cognitive data. Main outcome measures Structural brain measures included hippocampal atrophy  grey matter density  and white matter microstructure. Functional measures included cognitive decline over the study and cross sectional cognitive performance at the time of scanning. Results Higher alcohol consumption over the 30 year follow-up was associated with increased odds of hippocampal atrophy in a dose dependent fashion. While those consuming over 30 units a week were at the highest risk compared with abstainers (odds ratio 5.8  95% confidence interval 1.8 to 18.6; P≤0.001)  even those drinking moderately (14-21 units/week) had three times the odds of right sided hippocampal atrophy (3.4  1.4 to 8.1; P=0.007). There was no protective effect of light drinking (1-<7 units/week) over abstinence. Higher alcohol use was also associated with differences in corpus callosum microstructure and faster decline in lexical fluency. No association was found with cross sectional cognitive performance or longitudinal changes in semantic fluency or word recall. Conclusions Alcohol consumption  even at moderate levels  is associated with adverse brain outcomes including hippocampal atrophy. These results support the recent reduction in alcohol guidance in the UK and question the current limits recommended in the US."

A new understanding of spinal cord physiology and the introduction of membrane fusogens have provided new hope that a biological cure may soon become available. However  proof is needed from adequately powered animal studies. Methods and results: Two groups of rats (n=9  study group  n=6 controls) were submitted to complete transection of the dorsal cord at T10. The animals were randomized to receive either saline or polyethylene glycol (PEG) in situ. After 4 weeks  the treated group had recovered ambulation vs none in the control group (BBB scores; P=.0145). One control died. All animals were studied with somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). SSEP recovered postoperatively only in PEG-treated rats. At study end  DTI showed disappearance of the transection gap in the treated animals vs an enduring gap in controls (fractional anisotropy/FA at level: P=.0008). Conclusions: We show for the first time in an adequately powered study that the paralysis attendant to a complete transection of the spinal cord can be reversed. This opens the path to a severance-reapposition cure of spinal paralysis  in which the injured segment is excised and the two stumps approximated after vertebrectomy/diskectomies."

Parthenogenesis  gynogenesis  and hybridogenesis are the modes that have generally been ascribed to various unisexuals. Unisexual Ambystoma are abundant around the Great Lakes region of North America  and have variously been described as having all 3 reproductive modes. Diploid and polyploid unisexuals have nuclear genomes that combine the haploid genomes of 2 to 4 distinct sexual species  but the mtDNA is unlike any of those 4 species and is similar to another species  Ambystoma barbouri. To obtain better resolution of the reproductive mode used by unisexual Ambystoma and to explore the relationship of A. barbouri to the unisexuals  we sequenced the mitochondrial control and highly variable intergenic spacer region of 48 ambystomatids  which included 28 unisexuals  representatives of the 4 sexual species and A. barbouri. The unisexuals have similar sequences over most of their range  and form a close sister group to A. barbouri  with an estimated time of divergence of 2.4–3.9 million years ago. Individuals from the Lake Erie Islands (Kelleys  Pelee  North Bass) have a haplotype that demonstrates an isolation event. We examined highly variable microsatellite loci  and found that the genetic makeup of the unisexuals is highly variable and that unisexual individuals share microsatellite alleles with sexual individuals within populations. Although many progeny from the same female had the same genotype for 5 microsatellite DNA loci  there was no indication that any particular genome is consistently inherited in a clonal fashion in a population. The reproductive mode used by unisexual Ambystoma appears to be unique; we suggest kleptogenesis as a new unisexual reproductive mode that is used by these salamanders"

In contrast  the tetrametallic Ru3Rh produces only 40 turnovers of H2 due to differences in the excited state properties and nature of the catalysts upon reduction as ascertained from electrochemical data  transient absorption spectroscopy  and flash-quench experiments. While the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Ru3Rh is localized on a bridging ligand  it is Rh-centered in Ru3RhRu3 facilitating electron collection at Rh in the excited state and reductively quenched state. The Ru → Rh charge separated state of Ru3RhRu3 is endergonic with respect to the emissive Ru → dpp 3MLCT excited and cannot be formed by static electron transfer quenching of the 3MLCT state. Instead  a mechanism of subnanosecond charge separation from high lying states is proposed. Multiple reductions of Ru3 and Ru3Rh using sodium amalgam were carried out to compare UV–vis absorption spectra of reduced species and to evaluate the stability of highly reduced complexes. The Ru3 and Ru3Rh can be reduced by 10 and 13 electrons  respectively  to final states with all bridging ligands doubly reduced and all bpy ligands singly reduced."

Design Dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Data sources PubMed and Embase prior to June 2012 and references of relevant original papers and review articles. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Prospective cohort studies with relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of coronary heart disease or stroke for three or more categories of egg consumption. Results Eight articles with 17 reports (nine for coronary heart disease  eight for stroke) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis (3081269 person years and 5847 incident cases for coronary heart disease  and 4148095 person years and 7579 incident cases for stroke). No evidence of a curve linear association was seen between egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease or stroke (P=0.67 and P=0.27 for non-linearity  respectively). The summary relative risk of coronary heart disease for an increase of one egg consumed per day was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.15; P=0.88 for linear trend) without heterogeneity among studies (P=0.97  I2=0%). For stroke  the combined relative risk for an increase of one egg consumed per day was 0.91 (0.81 to 1.02; P=0.10 for linear trend) without heterogeneity among studies (P=0.46  I2=0%). In a subgroup analysis of diabetic populations  the relative risk of coronary heart disease comparing the highest with the lowest egg consumption was 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09; P=0.01). In addition  people with higher egg consumption had a 25% (0.57 to 0.99; P=0.04) lower risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusions Higher consumption of eggs (up to one egg per day) is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. The increased risk of coronary heart disease among diabetic patients and reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with higher egg consumption in subgroup analyses warrant further studies."

Advance of the perihelion of Mercury Deflection of light by a gravitational field Gravitational red shift Once he had completed his theory  Einstein immediately calculated the advance of the perihelion of Mercury  and he could hardly contain himself when GR produced the correct result. The next classical test was the deflection of light by a gravitational field  first performed by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1919. Born to Quaker parents in December 1882  Arthur was just two years old when he lost his father to a typhoid epidemic that ravaged England. As a child  Eddington was enamored of the night sky and often tried to count the number of stars he could see. Initially Eddington was schooled at home  but when he did start attending school  he excelled so much in mathematics that he won a scholarship to Owens College in Manchester at age 16. He graduated with first class honors in physics  and promptly won another scholarship to attend Trinity College at Cambridge University. Eddington completed his M.A. in 1905. First he worked on thermionic emission at the Cavendish Laboratory  and then tried his hand at mathematics research  but neither project went well. He briefly taught mathematics before re-discovering his first love: astronomy. Eventually he found a position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich  specializing in the study of stellar structure. By 1914 he had moved up to become director of the Cambridge Observatory; a Royal Society fellowship and Royal Medal soon followed. During Eddington’s tenure as secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society  Willem de Sitter sent him letters and papers about Einstein’s new general theory of relativity. Eddington became Einstein’s biggest evangelist at a time when there was still considerable wartime hostility and mistrust toward any work by German physicists. He soon became involved in attempts to confirm one of the theory’s key predictions. Since the masses of celestial bodies would cause spacetime to curve  Einstein predicted that light should follow those curves and bend ever so slightly. Isaac Newton had also predicted that light would bend in a gravitational field  although only half as much. Which prediction was more accurate? Scientists feared that measuring such a tiny curvature was simply beyond their experimental capabilities at the time."

We show that the reduction of thick Au oxide films results in the formation of Au nanoparticles (“oxide-derived Au”) that exhibit highly selective CO2 reduction to CO in water at overpotentials as low as 140 mV and retain their activity for at least 8 h. Under identical conditions  polycrystalline Au electrodes and several other nanostructured Au electrodes prepared via alternative methods require at least 200 mV of additional overpotential to attain comparable CO2 reduction activity and rapidly lose their activity. Electrokinetic studies indicate that the improved catalysis is linked to dramatically increased stabilization of the CO2•– intermediate on the surfaces of the oxide-derived Au electrodes."

This process is energetically inefficient because >1 V of overpotential is required for CO2 reduction to HCO2– on the metals currently used as cathodic catalysts. Pd reduces CO2 to HCO2– with no overpotential  but this activity has previously been limited to low synthesis rates and plagued by an unidentified deactivation pathway. Here we show that Pd nanoparticles dispersed on a carbon support reach high mass activities (50–80 mA HCO2– synthesis per mg Pd) when driven by less than 200 mV of overpotential in aqueous bicarbonate solutions. Electrokinetic measurements are consistent with a mechanism in which the rate-determining step is the addition of electrochemically generated surface adsorbed hydrogen to CO2 (i.e.  electrohydrogenation). The electrodes deactivate over the course of several hours because of a minor pathway that forms CO. Activity is recovered  however  by removing CO with brief air exposure."

Release of the sleep hormone melatonin is mediated by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). This study sought to investigate whether melatonin level and sleep quality can be modulated by decreasing night-time input to the ipRGCs. Methods: Subjects (ages 17–42  n = 21) wore short wavelength-blocking glasses prior to bedtime for 2 weeks. The ipRGC-mediated post illumination pupil response was measured before and after the experimental period. Stimulation was presented with a ganzfeld stimulator  including one-second and five-seconds of long and short wavelength light  and the pupil was imaged with an infrared camera. Pupil diameter was measured before  during and for 60 s following stimulation  and the six-second and 30 s post illumination pupil response and area under the curve following light offset were determined. Subjects wore an actigraph device for objective measurements of activity  light exposure  and sleep. Saliva samples were collected to assess melatonin content. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered to assess subjective sleep quality. Results: Subjects wore the blue-blocking glasses 3:57 ± 1:03 h each night. After the experimental period  the pupil showed a slower redilation phase  resulting in a significantly increased 30 s post illumination pupil response to one-second short wavelength light  and decreased area under the curve for one and five-second short wavelength light  when measured at the same time of day as baseline. Night time melatonin increased from 16.1 ± 7.5 pg mL−1 to 25.5 ± 10.7 pg mL−1 (P < 0.01). Objectively measured sleep duration increased 24 min  from 408.7 ± 44.9 to 431.5 ± 42.9 min (P < 0.001). Mean PSQI score improved from 5.6 ± 2.9 to 3.0 ± 2.2. Conclusions: The use of short wavelength-blocking glasses at night increased subjectively measured sleep quality and objectively measured melatonin levels and sleep duration  presumably as a result of decreased night-time stimulation of ipRGCs. Alterations in the ipRGC-driven pupil response suggest a shift in circadian phase. Results suggest that minimising short wavelength light following sunset may help in regulating sleep patterns."

Design Population based cohort study of linked electronic health records covering primary care  hospital admissions  and mortality in 1997-2010 (median follow-up six years). Setting CALIBER (ClinicAl research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records). Participants 1937360 adults (51% women)  aged ≥30 who were free from cardiovascular disease at baseline. Main outcome measures 12 common symptomatic manifestations of cardiovascular disease  including chronic stable angina  unstable angina  acute myocardial infarction  unheralded coronary heart disease death  heart failure  sudden coronary death/cardiac arrest  transient ischaemic attack  ischaemic stroke  intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage  peripheral arterial disease  and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Results 114859 individuals received an incident cardiovascular diagnosis during follow-up. Non-drinking was associated with an increased risk of unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.33  95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.45)  myocardial infarction (1.32  1.24 to1.41)  unheralded coronary death (1.56  1.38 to 1.76)  heart failure (1.24  1.11 to 1.38)  ischaemic stroke (1.12  1.01 to 1.24)  peripheral arterial disease (1.22  1.13 to 1.32)  and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.32  1.17 to 1.49) compared with moderate drinking (consumption within contemporaneous UK weekly/daily guidelines of 21/3 and 14/2 units for men and women  respectively). Heavy drinking (exceeding guidelines) conferred an increased risk of presenting with unheralded coronary death (1.21  1.08 to 1.35)  heart failure (1.22  1.08 to 1.37)  cardiac arrest (1.50  1.26 to 1.77)  transient ischaemic attack (1.11  1.02 to 1.37)  ischaemic stroke (1.33  1.09 to 1.63)  intracerebral haemorrhage (1.37  1.16 to 1.62)  and peripheral arterial disease (1.35; 1.23 to 1.48)  but a lower risk of myocardial infarction (0.88  0.79 to 1.00) or stable angina (0.93  0.86 to 1.00). Conclusions Heterogeneous associations exist between level of alcohol consumption and the initial presentation of cardiovascular diseases. This has implications for counselling patients  public health communication  and clinical research  suggesting a more nuanced approach to the role of alcohol in prevention of cardiovascular disease is necessary."

APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice have been developed as an AD model and are characterized by plaque formation at 4–6 months of age. Here  we sought to better understand AD-related cognitive decline by characterizing various types of memory. In order to better understand how memory declines with AD  APP/PS1 mice were bred with ArcCreERT2 mice. In this line  neural ensembles activated during memory encoding can be indelibly tagged and directly compared with neural ensembles activated during memory retrieval (i.e.  memory traces/engrams). We first administered a battery of tests examining depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors  as well as spatial  social  and cognitive memory to APP/PS1 × ArcCreERT2 × channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) mice. Dentate gyrus (DG) neural ensembles were then optogenetically stimulated in these mice to improve memory impairment. AD mice had the most extensive differences in fear memory  as assessed by contextual fear conditioning (CFC)  which was accompanied by impaired DG memory traces. Optogenetic stimulation of DG neural ensembles representing a CFC memory increased memory retrieval in the appropriate context in AD mice when compared with control (Ctrl) mice. Moreover  optogenetic stimulation facilitated reactivation of the neural ensembles that were previously activated during memory encoding. These data suggest that activating previously learned DG memory traces can rescue cognitive impairments and point to DG manipulation as a potential target to treat memory loss commonly seen in AD."

The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively close to the Sun. The data constrain the product ML π rel where ML is the lens system mass and π rel is the lens–source relative parallax. If the lens system is nearby (large π rel)  then ML is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the companion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon. The best-fit solution has a large lens–source relative proper motion  μrel = 19.6 ± 1.6 mas yr−1  which would rule out a distant lens system unless the source star has an unusually high proper motion. However  data from the OGLE collaboration nearly rule out a high source proper motion  so the exoplanet+exomoon model is the favored interpretation for the best fit model. However  there is an alternate solution that has a lower proper motion and fits the data almost as well. This solution is compatible with a distant (so stellar) host. A Bayesian analysis does not favor the exoplanet+exomoon interpretation  so Occam's razor favors a lens system in the bulge with host and companion masses of M_host = 0.12M and m_comp = 18 M  at a projected separation of a = 0.84 AU. The existence of this degeneracy is an unlucky accident  so current microlensing experiments are in principle sensitive to exomoons. In some circumstances  it will be possible to definitively establish the mass of such lens systems through the microlensing parallax effect. Future experiments will be sensitive to less extreme exomoons."

Weight losses achieved by diet and lifestyle changes  very-low-energy diets  non-surgical medical interventions and bariatric surgery translated into significantly increased pregnancy rates and/or live birth in overweight and/or obese women undergoing ART in 8 of the 11 studies reviewed. In addition  regularization of the menstrual pattern  a decrease in cancellation rates  an increase in the number of embryos available for transfer  a reduction in the number of ART cycles required to achieve pregnancy and a decrease in miscarriage rates were reported. There were also a number of natural conceptions in five of the six studies that reported this outcome. Non-surgical medical weight loss procedures and bariatric surgery induced the greatest weight losses  but their use  as well as that of very-low-energy diets  for weight loss prior to ART requires careful consideration. While the overall quality of the studies included in this review was poor  these results support the clinical recommendation of advising overweight and/or obese women to lose weight prior to ART. Prospective randomized controlled trials are required to establish efficacious evidence-based guidelines for weight loss interventions in overweight and/or obese women prior to ART treatment."

Merck & Co.  Inc.  Chas. Pfizer & Co. Inc. (now Pfizer  Inc.) and E.R. Squibb & Sons (now Bristol-Myers Squibb Company).The introduction of penicillin in the 1940s  which began the era of antibiotics  has been recognized as one of the greatest advances in therapeutic medicine. The discovery of penicillin and the initial recognition of its therapeutic potential occurred in the United Kingdom  but  due to World War II  the United States played the major role in developing large-scale production of the drug  thus making a life-saving substance in limited supply into a widely available medicine.Penicillin heralded the dawn of the antibiotic age. Before its introduction there was no effective treatment for infections such as pneumonia  gonorrhea or rheumatic fever. Hospitals were full of people with blood poisoning contracted from a cut or a scratch  and doctors could do little for them but wait and hope. Antibiotics are compounds produced by bacteria and fungi which are capable of killing  or inhibiting  competing microbial species. This phenomenon has long been known; it may explain why the ancient Egyptians had the practice of applying a poultice of moldy bread to infected wounds. But it was not until 1928 that penicillin  the first true antibiotic  was discovered by Alexander Fleming  Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary's Hospital in London. Returning from holiday on September 3  1928  Fleming began to sort through petri dishes containing colonies of Staphylococcus  bacteria that cause boils  sore throats and abscesses. He noticed something unusual on one dish. It was dotted with colonies  save for one area where a blob of mold was growing. The zone immediately around the mold—later identified as a rare strain of Penicillium notatum—was clear  as if the mold had secreted something that inhibited bacterial growth. Fleming found that his \"mold juice\" was capable of killing a wide range of harmful bacteria  such as streptococcus  meningococcus and the diphtheria bacillus. He then set his assistants  Stuart Craddock and Frederick Ridley  the difficult task of isolating pure penicillin from the mold juice. It proved to be very unstable  and they were only able to prepare solutions of crude material to work with. Fleming published his findings in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in June 1929  with only a passing reference to penicillin's potential therapeutic benefits. At this stage it looked as if its main application would be in isolating penicillin-insensitive bacteria from penicillin-sensitive bacteria in a mixed culture. This at least was of practical benefit to bacteriologists  and kept interest in penicillin going. Others  including Harold Raistrick  Professor of Biochemistry at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  tried to purify penicillin but failed."

Modeling studies have shown that there are trade-offs between changes in temperature and hydrological cycle in response to solar geoengineering. Here we investigate the possibility of stabilizing both global mean temperature and precipitation simultaneously by combining two geoengineering approaches: stratospheric sulfate aerosol increase (SAI) that deflects sunlight to space and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) that enables more longwave radiation to escape to space. Using the slab ocean configuration of National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model  we simulate SAI by uniformly adding sulfate aerosol in the upper stratosphere and CCT by uniformly increasing cirrus cloud ice particle falling speed. Under an idealized warming scenario of abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2  we show that by combining appropriate amounts of SAI and CCT geoengineering  global mean (or land mean) temperature and precipitation can be restored simultaneously to preindustrial levels. However  compared to SAI  cocktail geoengineering by mixing SAI and CCT does not markedly improve the overall similarity between geoengineered climate and preindustrial climate on regional scales. Some optimal spatially nonuniform mixture of SAI with CCT might have the potential to better mitigate climate change at both the global and regional scales."

Representation of aerosol–cloud interactions in global models is particularly challenging because these interactions occur on typically unresolved scales. Observational studies show influences of aerosol on clouds  but correlations between aerosol and clouds are insufficient to constrain aerosol forcing because of the difficulty in separating aerosol and meteorological impacts. In this commentary  we argue that this current impasse may be overcome with the development of approaches to conduct control experiments whereby aerosol particle perturbations can be introduced into patches of marine low clouds in a systematic manner. Such cloud perturbation experiments constitute a fresh approach to climate science and would provide unprecedented data to untangle the effects of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics and the resulting reflection of solar radiation by clouds. The control experiments would provide a critical test of high-resolution models that are used to develop an improved representation aerosol–cloud interactions needed to better constrain aerosol forcing in global climate models."

It is seen that the plasma density in the localized glow region and the luminous intensity of this structure increases with the increase in the magnetic field strength. The effect of such localized glow region on the plasma floating potential fluctuation dynamics is investigated. Floating potential fluctuations show that the emergence of such localized structure leads the system towards nonlinear dynamical regimes. Increasing the magnetic field strength reveals a transition from order to chaos via period doubling bifurcation. This transition is analyzed by using bifurcation diagram  phase space plots  power spectrum plots  Hilbert Huang transform  and by estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent. The interaction of plasma with a dipole magnetic field produces a non-monotonic potential structure in the vicinity of the cathode surface. Thus  to understand the dynamical origin of such complex oscillations  we have carried out a numerical modelling for ion dynamics by considering trapping of ions inside the potential structure. Numerical results show the existence of period doubling route to chaos."

Therefore  factors that facilitate self-control for other types of goals (e.g.  health and financial) should also promote ethical behavior. Across four studies  we find support for this possibility. Specifically  we find that only under conditions that facilitate conflict identification—including the consideration of several decisions simultaneously (i.e.  a broad decision frame) and perceived high connectedness to the future self—does anticipating a temptation to behave dishonestly in advance promote honesty. We demonstrate these interaction patterns between conflict identification and temptation anticipation in negotiation situations (Study 1)  lab tasks (Study 2)  and ethical dilemmas in the workplace (Studies 3-4). We conclude that identifying a self-control conflict and anticipating a temptation are two necessary preconditions for ethical decision making."

Meat consumption—especially in the times of cruel animal farming—is related to the exclusion of animals from the human scope of justice. In the present research  it was hypothesized that the conception of human uniqueness (denying animals certain psychological characteristics) might be a strategy of meat-eaters' moral disengagement. Three studies compared the extent to which vegetarians and omnivores attribute psychological characteristics to humans versus animals. In Study 1  vegetarian participants ascribed more secondary (uniquely human) emotions to animals than did the omnivores; however  there were no differences in primary (animalistic) emotions. Study 2 showed that omnivores distinguish human characteristics from animalistic ones more sharply than vegetarians do  while both groups do not differ in distinguishing human characteristics from mechanistic ones. Study 3 confirmed the results by showing that omnivores ascribed less secondary emotions to traditionally edible animals than to the non-edible species  while vegetarians did not differentiate these animals. These results support the claim that the lay conceptions of ‘human uniqueness’ are strategies of moral disengagement"

Ibs and country-specific longevity (e50) increase for each country were self-calculated. These data were then matched to T1D prevalence by country for our ecological study among 118 countries. Countries were also grouped to study the associations in different regions. SPSS V.22 was used for correlation analysis. Results Worldwide  both Ibs and life expectancy at birth (Ibs proxy) were significantly correlated to T1D prevalence in Pearson r (r=0.713  p<0.001 and r=0.722  p<0.001  respectively) and Spearman's r (r=0.724  p<0.001 and r=0.689  p<0.001  respectively).

Globally  both life expectancy at birth and Ibs exponentially correlated to T1D prevalence. Pearson correlations generally existed in different country categorizations by geographic region  culture background and economic status. Conclusions Reduced natural selection may have contributed to the increasing T1D prevalence worldwide.

Here we present observations of a previously unidentified type of steady-state flow behavior that we term “dynamic connectivity.” We demonstrate that flow of the nonwetting phase occurs through a network of connections that continuously rearrange between filled pores. This observation suggests that we need to modify our models of two-phase flow that are fundamental to describing subsurface flow processes such as geologic CO2 storage and hydrocarbon recovery. Abstract: The current conceptual picture of steady-state multiphase Darcy flow in porous media is that the fluid phases organize into separate flow pathways with stable interfaces. Here we demonstrate a previously unobserved type of steady-state flow behavior  which we term “dynamic connectivity ” using fast pore-scale X-ray imaging. We image the flow of N2 and brine through a permeable sandstone at subsurface reservoir conditions  and low capillary numbers  and at constant fluid saturation. At any instant  the network of pores filled with the nonwetting phase is not necessarily connected. Flow occurs along pathways that periodically reconnect  like cars controlled by traffic lights. This behavior is consistent with an energy balance  where some of the energy of the injected fluids is sporadically converted to create new interfaces."

Unlike natural environments  urban environments are filled with stimulation that captures attention dramatically and additionally requires directed attention (e.g.  to avoid being hit by a car)  making them less restorative.

Fluorosis in Australian children was highly prevalent in the early 1990s. Policy measures were introduced to control fluoride exposure so as to reduce the prevalence of fluorosis. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures in reducing the prevalence of fluorosis among Australian children. Methods: A random sample of South Australian children born in 1989–1994 was selected in 2002/2003  stratified by fluoridation status and urban/rural residence. Children were targeted to form three successive birth cohorts: those children born in 1989/1990  1991/1992 and 1993/1994  respectively. Fluoride exposures were assessed by questionnaire. One dentist examined 677 children for fluorosis using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) Index. Data were reweighted to reflect the state's child population. Case definitions of fluorosis were: having a TF score of 1+ (TF1+) or a TF score of 2+ (TF2+) on one or both maxillary central incisors. Results: A higher proportion of children in the later birth cohorts used low-concentration fluoridated toothpaste  and a smaller amount of toothpaste was used when they commenced toothbrushing. The fluorosis experience in this population was mostly very mild to mild. There was a significant decline in the prevalence of fluorosis across the three successive birth cohorts. The prevalence of fluorosis by TF1+ case definition declined from 34.7% to 22.1% and by TF2+ case definition from 17.9% to 8.3%. Risk factors for fluorosis were use of standard-concentration fluoridated toothpaste  an eating and/or licking toothpaste habit and exposure to fluoridated water. Conclusion: The experience of fluorosis among the South Australian child population was mostly very mild to mild. There was a marked decline in the prevalence of fluorosis across the three successive birth cohorts. The decline was mainly linked with the reduction in exposure to fluoride from fluoridated toothpaste."

Hektoria  Green and Evans glaciers accelerated eightfold between 2000 and 2003 and decelerated moderately in 2003. Jorum and Crane glaciers accelerated twofold in early 2003 and threefold by the end of 2003. In contrast  Flask and Leppard glaciers  further south  did not accelerate as they are still buttressed by an ice shelf. The mass loss associated with the flow acceleration exceeds 27 km3 per year  and ice is thinning at rates of tens of meters per year. We attribute this abrupt evolution of the glaciers to the removal of the buttressing ice shelf. The magnitude of the glacier changes illustrates the importance of ice shelves on ice sheet mass balance and contribution to sea level change."

Satellite laser altimetry from ICESat indicates the surface of Hektoria Glacier lowered by up to 38 ± 6 m in a six-month period beginning one year after the break-up in March 2002. Smaller elevation losses are observed for Crane and Jorum glaciers over a later 5-month period. Two glaciers south of the collapse area  Flask and Leppard  show little change in speed or elevation. Seasonal variations in speed preceding the large post-collapse velocity increases suggest that both summer melt percolation and changes in the stress field due to shelf removal play a major role in glacier dynamics."

This exceptional melt event lasted for three months and was followed by the collapse of Larsen B Ice Shelf  during which 3 200 km2 of ice shelf surface was lost. The strong melting was caused by a persistent atmospheric circulation anomaly  which depleted sea ice concentrations in front of Larsen Ice Shelf and transported warm air to the ice shelf throughout the 2001/02 summer. This supports the theory that large meltwater fluxes accelerate the retreat of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves."

The objective of this study was to characterize prehistoric human diets to shed light on human adaptability and land use in an island environment with limited resources. Materials and methods: Materials for this study included human  faunal  and botanical remains from the archaeological sites Anakena and Ahu Tepeu on Rapa Nui  dating from c. 1400 AD to the historic period  and modern reference material. We used bulk carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses and amino acid compound specific isotope analyses (AA-CSIA) of collagen isolated from prehistoric human and faunal bone  to assess the use of marine versus terrestrial resources and to investigate the underlying baseline values. Similar isotope analyses of archaeological and modern botanical and marine samples were used to characterize the local environment. Results: Results of carbon and nitrogen AA-CSIA independently show that around half the protein in diets from the humans measured came from marine sources; markedly higher than previous estimates. We also observed higher δ15N values in human collagen than could be expected from the local environment. Discussion: Our results suggest highly elevated δ15N values could only have come from consumption of crops grown in substantially manipulated soils. These findings strongly suggest that the prehistoric population adapted and exhibited astute environmental awareness in a harsh environment with nutrient poor soils. Our results also have implications for evaluating marine reservoir corrections of radiocarbon dates."

The nanodrops were formed by condensation of vapor in a supersonic nozzle  and the ice was probed within 100 μs of freezing using femtosecond wide-angle X-ray scattering at the Linac Coherent Light Source free-electron X-ray laser. The X-ray diffraction spectra indicate that this ice has a metastable  predominantly cubic structure; the shape of the first ice diffraction peak suggests stacking-disordered ice with a cubicity value  χ  in the range of 0.78 ± 0.05. The cubicity value determined here is higher than those determined in experiments with micron-sized drops but comparable to those found in molecular dynamics simulations. The high cubicity is most likely caused by the extremely low freezing temperatures and by the rapid freezing  which occurs on a ∼1 μs time scale in single nanodroplets."

SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of very few supernovae for which the inner ejecta can be spatially resolved but are not yet strongly affected by interaction with the surroundings. Our observations of SN 1987A with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array are of the highest resolution to date and reveal the detailed morphology of cold molecular gas in the innermost regions of the remnant. The 3D distributions of carbon and silicon monoxide (CO and SiO) emission differ  but both have a central deficit  or torus-like distribution  possibly a result of radioactive heating during the first weeks (\"nickel heating\").

The Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) was the species most frequently reported to be captured by mantids. Captures were reported also from Canada  Central America  and South America. In Africa  Asia  Australia  and Europe  we found 29 records of small passerine birds captured by mantids. Of the birds captured  78% were killed and eaten by the mantids  2% succeeded in escaping on their own  and 18% were freed by humans. In North America  native and non-native mantids were engaged in bird predation. Our compilation suggests that praying mantises frequently prey on hummingbirds in gardens in North America; therefore  we suggest caution in use of large-sized mantids  particularly non-native mantids  in gardens for insect pest control."

Exotic predators can have devastating impacts on native prey species and thwart reintroduction efforts  in part due to prey naïveté caused by an absence of co-evolution between predators and prey. Attempts have been made to improve the anti-predator behaviours of reintroduced native prey by conducting laboratory-based predator recognition training but results have been varied and have rarely led to improved survival in reintroduction programmes. We investigated whether in situ predator exposure could improve anti-predator responses of a predator-naïve mammal by exposing prey populations to low densities of introduced predators under controlled conditions. We reintroduced 352 burrowing bettongs to a 26-km2 fenced exclosure at the Arid Recovery Reserve in South Australia and exposed them to feral cats (density 0.03–0.15 cats/km2) over an 18-month period. At the same time  we translocated a different group of bettongs into an exclosure free of introduced predators  as a control. We compared three behaviours (flight initiation distances  trap docility and behaviour at feeding trays) of cat-exposed and control bettongs before the translocations  then at 6  12 and 18 months post-translocation. Cat-exposed bettongs displayed changes in behaviour that suggested increased wariness  relative to control bettongs. At 18 months post-reintroduction  cat-exposed bettongs had greater flight initiation distances and approached feed trays more slowly than control bettongs. Cat-exposed bettongs also increased their trap docility over time. Synthesis and applications. Translocation is recommended as a conservation tool for many threatened species yet success rates are generally low. We demonstrate that controlled levels of in situ predator exposure can increase wariness in the behaviour of naïve prey. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that in situ predator exposure could be used as a method to improve the anti-predator responses of predator-naïve threatened species populations."

Up to now  only a little has been known about the topography  structure and function of the patella in marsupials. Therefore the stifles of 61 marsupials of 30 different species were studied by radiography  necropsy and light microscopy. It was found that only the family of bandicoots (Peramelidae) possessed a typical patella. The other species revealed a patelloid consisting of fibrocartilage. The structure of the patelloid revealed common characteristic features in the following families of marsupials: (1) Dasyuridae  Phalangeridae  Pseudocheriidae  and Potoroidae; (2) Burramyidae; (3) Phascolarctidae  Vombatidae  and Dendrolagus; and (4) Superfamily Macropodoidea (except Dendrolagus and Potoroidae). Our results imply that the degree of differentiation in the fibrocartilage of the patelloid was strongly correlated to the mechanical forces acting on the patelloid which are a result of the specific kind of locomotion and the way of life. Generally the bony patella does not belong to the phylogenetic programme of the marsupials – with the exception of the bandicoots which are very closely related to the subclass of placental mammals (Eutheria)."

Lissamphibians are identified as the major lineage that fail to develop a patella. However  this sesamoid is reported at least once in anurans  but without detailed anatomical discussions. Through anatomical and histological studies we examined the topography and tissue composition of two structures that we identify as the proximal and distal patellae in several anuran species. We explored the evolution of these sesamoids through ancestral state reconstruction  finding that they are ancestral for amphibians and possibly tetrapods as a whole. The presence of these patellae in anurans would roll back their origin to the last common ancestor of tetrapods. From a functional perspective  the overwhelming evidence of fibrocartilage as a clear response to compression suggests that the fibrocartilaginous patellae could also withstand the mechanical stress generated on the knee undergoing compression during limb extension."

Observations were obtained in a trial “seed” campaign conducted in one visit on 24 Feb 2014  and a follow-up campaign conducted soon after the New Horizons flyby that consisted of 3 visits spanning 26 Jul – 03 Aug 2015. In a total of 174 ksec of on-target time  in the 0.31 – 0.60 keV passband  we measured 8 total photons in a co-moving 11 x 11 pixel2 box (the 90% flux aperture determined by observations of fixed background sources in the field) measuring ~121 000 x 121 000 km2 (or ~100 x 100 RPluto) at Pluto. No photons were detected from 0.60 – 1.0 keV in this box during the same exposures. Allowing for background  we find a net signal of 6.8 counts and a statistical noise level of 1.2 counts  for a detection of Pluto in this passband at > 99.95% confidence. The Pluto photons do not have the spectral shape of the background  are coincident with a 90% flux aperture co-moving with Pluto  and are not confused with any background source  so we consider them as sourced from the Pluto system. The mean 0.31 - 0.60 keV X-ray power from Pluto is 200 +200/-100 MW  in the middle range of X-ray power levels seen for other known solar system emission sources: auroral precipitation  solar X-ray scattering  and charge exchange (CXE) between solar wind (SW) ions and atmospheric neutrals. We eliminate auroral effects as a source  as Pluto has no known magnetic field and the New Horizons Alice UV spectrometer detected no airglow from Pluto during the flyby. Nano-scale atmospheric haze particles could lead to enhanced resonant scattering of solar X-rays from Pluto  but the energy signature of the detected photons does not match the solar spectrum and estimates of Pluto’s scattered X-ray emission are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude below the 3.9 ± 0.7 x 10-5 cps found in our observations. Charge-exchange-driven emission from hydrogenic and heliogenic SW carbon  nitrogen  and oxygen (CNO) ions can produce the energy signature seen  and the 6 x 1025 neutral gas escape rate from Pluto deduced from New Horizons’ data (Gladstone et al. 2016) can support the ~3.0 +3.0/-1.5 x 1024 X-ray photons/s emission rate required by our observations. Using the solar wind proton density and speed measured by the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument in the vicinity of Pluto at the time of the photon emissions  we find a factor of 40 +40/ -20 lower SW minor ions flowing planarly into an 11 x 11 pixel2   90% flux box centered on Pluto than are needed to support the observed emission rate. Hence  the SW must be somehow significantly focused and enhanced within 60 000 km (projected) of Pluto for this mechanism to work."

How these morphological features affect aerodynamic force production and sound suppression or noise reduction  however  is still not well known. Here we address an integrated study of owl-inspired single feather wing models with and without leading-edge serrations by combining large-eddy simulations (LES) with particle-image velocimetry (PIV) and force measurements in a low-speed wind tunnel. With velocity and pressure spectra analysis  we demonstrate that leading-edge serrations can passively control the laminar-turbulent transition over the upper wing surface  i.e. the suction surface at all angles of attack (0°AoA20°)  and hence play a crucial role in aerodynamic force and sound production. We find that there exists a tradeoff between force production and sound suppression: serrated leading-edges reduce aerodynamic performance at lower AoAs15° compared to clean leading-edges but are capable of achieving both noise reduction and aerodynamic performance at higher AoAs15° where owl wings often reach in flight. Our results indicate that the owl-inspired leading-edge serrations may be a useful device for aero-acoustic control in biomimetic rotor designs for wind turbines  aircrafts  multi-rotor drones as well as other fluid machinery."

The observed rapid CSL increase (about 12.74 cm/yr) and significant drop (~−6.72 cm/yr) during the periods 1979–1995 and 1996–2015 are well accounted for by integrated PER flux predictions of ~+12.38 and ~−6.79 cm/yr  respectively.

In a subsequent presentation  Sergio Boixo  Martinis’ colleague at Google  said that a quantum computer with approximately 50 qubits will be capable of certain tasks beyond anything the fastest classical computers can do. Researchers say that quantum computers promise an exponential increase in speed for a subset of computational chores like prime number factorization or exact simulations of organic molecules.

I. larkini sp. nov. is distinguished by a broad jugal with a blunt anterior end that extends as far forward as the middle of the external naris  separating the maxilla and lacrimal; and a unique combination of other features. I. somersetensis sp. nov. is distinguished by a jugal with a nearly straight dorsal ramus that lacks a right-angle dorsal bend; a high  narrow  crescentic postorbital that forms almost all of the posterior margin of the orbit and separates the jugal dorsal ramus from the orbit; and an ilium that is wide relative to its length  more oblong than rib-like. The identifications are supported by a phylogenetic analysis which finds the new species more closely related to each other than to other species of the genus. We also identify a squamosal in both species  which confirms that it is present in the genus. This study suggests that hindfin morphology has some taxonomic utility  at least within the genus. The new species increases the diversity of Ichthyosaurus to six species  three of which are found in the Hettangian of Somerset."

Treatments exist  but far too often patients relapse with devastating impacts on themselves and those around them. Now  scientists report that they have made progress toward a vaccine against the effects of fentanyl  a synthetic opioid  in combination with heroin.

ACS  the world’s largest scientific society  is holding the meeting here through Thursday. It features nearly 9 400 presentations on a wide range of science topics. “There is an urgent need to discover effective medications to treat substance use disorders. Increasingly  drug users are turning to opioids and powerful synthetic versions of these drugs that can sometimes be as much as 100 times more potent than heroin ” says Kim D. Janda  Ph.D.  who led the research into the vaccines. “Moreover  many patients receiving treatment relapse.” The rise of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is a critical element in the opioid crisis in the U.S. Heroin laced with fentanyl or fentanyl alone have contributed to the dramatic rise in overdose deaths among addicts. Janda’s team at the Scripps Research Institute has prepared a vaccine that is effective against fentanyl and has made progress in the development of a combination vaccine that offers protection from both heroin and fentanyl. In addition to their use on the streets  fentanyl and carfentanyl — an even more toxic cousin — are potential terrorist weapons. Janda explains that vaccines could offer protection against the drugs in this context  too."

State officials laud the benefits of lottery proceeds and promote the fun and excitement of participation. This entertainment value is one explanation for lottery demand by the poor: individuals with lower incomes substitute lottery play for other entertainment. Alternatively  low-income consumers may view lotteries as a convenient and otherwise rare opportunity for radically improving their standard of living. Bad times may cause desperation  and the desperate may turn to lotteries in an effort to escape hardship. This study tests these competing explanations. We examine lottery sales data from 39 states over 10 years and find a strong and positive relationship between sales and poverty rates. In contrast  we find no relationship between movie ticket sales  another inexpensive form of entertainment  and poverty rates."

This further development has enabled us to extend the theory to deal with other areas  in addition to opinion formation  in which social comparison is important. Specifically  we shall develop below how the theory applies to the appraisal and evaluation of abilities as well as opinions. Such theories and hypotheses in the area of social psychology are frequently viewed in terms of how “plausible” they seem. “Plausibility” usually means whether or not the theory or hypothesis fits one’s intuition or one’s common sense. In this meaning much of the theory which is to be presented here is not” plausible “. The theory does  however  explain a considerable amount of data and leads to testable derivations. Three experiments  specifically designed to test predictions from this extension of the theory  have now been completed (5  12  19). They all provide good corroboration. We will in the following pages develop the theory and present the relevant data. "

It is posited here that these responses are linked to the motivational tendency to defend and justify the societal status quo in the face of the threat posed by environmental problems. The present research finds that system justification tendencies are associated with greater denial of environmental realities and less commitment to pro-environmental action. Moreover  the effects of political conservatism  national identification  and gender on denial of environmental problems are explained by variability in system justification tendencies. However  this research finds that it is possible to eliminate the negative effect of system justification on environmentalism by encouraging people to regard pro-environmental change as patriotic and consistent with protecting the status quo (i.e.  as a case of “system-sanctioned change”). Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

        "text": "The theory of evolution occupies a central place in modern biology  but a very different place in the public sphere. It is vilified by politically and religiously conservative organizations  and is widely misinterpreted by the public. Here we describe some subtle (or not-so-subtle!) changes that have been shaping evolution instruction in Turkish secondary school education. In Turkey  where the structure and content of primary and secondary education is developed and regulated by the National Education Ministry (NEM)  coverage of evolution in curricula is influenced strongly by national political trends.1 In early years of the Turkish Republic (up to about 1945)  evolution was introduced in history textbooks as a well established scientific truth in the context of history of humanity. Later  as populist religious rhetoric in the political scene became stronger  evolution was relegated to science and biology curricula and at the same time instruction became unsystematic and superficial; textbooks’ treatment of evolution became ambiguous and less assertive. After the 1980 military coup  NEM’s stand against teaching evolution culminated in the inclusion in biology textbooks of creationism as an alternative theory for origin of life on earth. Since 2001  evolution’s textbook presence has further diminished.1 2 Currently  only those students who choose a science-oriented track have any exposure to evolution  and this is in the second term of the 12th (final) year  when they spend most of their time not at the school but preparing elsewhere for the central university entrance exam. It is interesting to note that religion instruction  introduced in the 1980s and expanded in the later years  is now compulsory for all students between 5th and 12th grades. In the 1983 edition of a standard high school textbook  evolution merits its own chapter. In the 2011 edition  by contrast  evolution is part of a chapter called “The beginning of life and evolution” in which creationism is also discussed. Another interesting difference between the two books relates to the meaning of “scientific theory”; the recent version treats the concept as an open-ended  indefinite opinion rather than a fact  reducing it to an unclear hypothesis. It is not only high school education that is affected. There are no universities in Turkey offering undergraduate or graduate degrees in evolutionary biology or in related fields  and even courses in the area are hard to come by. A recent study of 75 students training to be biology teachers illustrates evolution’s problems in Turkey: 44% considered the idea to be speculative and 68% thought that it was not based on scientific evidence. When probed deeper it became clear that those who had inadequate or inconsistent conceptions about the nature of science were likely to reject evolution.3 Another survey  of 1098 freshman and senior undergraduate students enrolled in biology  biology education and elementary science education programs in 11 public universities in Turkey  yielded similar results. 20.7% rejected and 27.8% accepted the theory of evolution  with 51.4% being undecided  presumably because of their lack of exposure to these ideas."

Dysbiosis of the microbiome may result in altered neurodevelopment; however  it is unclear which specific members of microbiota are most influential and what factors might mediate the relationship between the gut and the brain. Twenty-four vaginally-derived male piglets were subjected to magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 30 d of age. Ascending colon contents  feces  and blood were collected and analyzed for volatile fatty acids  microbiota relative abundance by 16s rRNA  and serum metabolites  respectively. A mediation analysis was performed to assess the mediatory effect of serum biomarkers on the relationship between microbiota and neurometabolites. Results indicated fecal Ruminococcus and Butyricimonas predicted brain N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Analysis of serum biomarkers indicated Ruminococcus independently predicted serum serotonin and cortisol. A 3-step mediation indicated: i) Ruminococcus negatively predicted NAA  ii) Ruminococcus negatively predicted cortisol  and iii) a significant indirect effect (i.e.  the effect of fecal Ruminococcus through cortisol on NAA) was observed and the direct effect became insignificant. Thus  serum cortisol fully mediated the relationship between fecal Ruminococcus and brain NAA. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy  this study used a statistical mediation analysis and provides a novel perspective into the potential underlying mechanisms through which the microbiota may shape brain development. This is the first study to link Ruminococcus  cortisol  and NAA in vivo  and these findings are substantiated by previous literature indicating these factors may be influential in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."

Spiders behaved in a manner typical of daily activity until totality  when many began taking down webs. After solar reappearance  most spiders that had begun taking down webs rebuilt them. There was no significant difference in the overall activity patterns of spiders during totality across a range of colony sizes. Experimental illumination of part of a colony during totality altered web takedown behavior. While spiders in the darkness of totality began to take down webs  those spiders which were artificially illuminated did not. These observations suggest that the primary environmental cue responsible for the daily rhythm of web building behavior in this species is light level."

Beginning 2 days prior to the eclipse and continuing through the day following the eclipse  data were collected from 1100 to 1300 hours daily. At 1214 hours on the day of the eclipse  when the sky began to darken and the temperature began to decrease  solitary females and females with infants moved to the top of a climbing structure. As the eclipse progressed  additional chimpanzees began to congregate on the climbing structure and to orient their bodies in the direction of the sun and moon. At 1223 hours  during the period of maximum eclipse  the animals continued to orient their bodies toward the sun and moon and to turn their faces upward. One juvenile stood upright and gestured in the direction of the sun and moon. Sunlight began to increase at 1225 hours  and as it became brighter  the animals began to descend from the climbing structure. The behaviors exhibited by the group during the period of maximum eclipse were not observed prior to or following the eclipse nor as darkness approached at normal  daily sunset. These data indicate that a solar eclipse  a rare and uncommon environmental event  can influence and modulate the behavior of chimpanzees."

Across one field and three lab studies  we found that  even without revisiting any photos  participants who could freely take photographs during an experience recognized more of what they saw and less of what they heard  compared with those who could not take any photographs. Further  merely taking mental photos had similar effects on memory. These results provide support for the idea that photo taking induces a shift in attention toward visual aspects and away from auditory aspects of an experience. Additional findings were in line with this mechanism: Participants with a camera had better recognition of aspects of the scene that they photographed than of aspects they did not photograph. Furthermore  participants who used a camera during their experience recognized even nonphotographed aspects better than participants without a camera did. Meta-analyses including all reported studies support these findings."

You can choose a spot along the center line to maximize your duration of totality along with good weather prospects or you can choose a point near the limit lines of totality to enjoy dramatic effects  such as extended views of the sun’s photosphere  the innermost and most colorful section of the sun’s corona. Eclipse maps are astonishing because they dare to predict precise locations and timings of future eclipses as well as the paths of eclipses in antiquity. Each eclipse map tells a story that weaves together geographic knowledge  information visualization  scientific understanding  and artistic flourishes.

This reduction of food availability would continue  with gradually decreasing amplitude  for more than a decade. Assuming these impacts are indicative of those in other major grain producers  a nuclear war using much less than 1% of the current global arsenal could produce a global food crisis and put a billion people at risk of famine."

Participants were 15 psychiatrically healthy nicotine-dependent smokers (10 males; mean age of 51 years)  with a mean of six previous lifetime quit attempts  and smoking a mean of 19 cigarettes per day for a mean of 31 years at intake. Biomarkers assessing smoking status  and self-report measures of smoking behavior demonstrated that 12 of 15 participants (80%) showed seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up. The observed smoking cessation rate substantially exceeds rates commonly reported for other behavioral and/or pharmacological therapies (typically <35%). Although the open-label design does not allow for definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of psilocybin  these findings suggest psilocybin may be a potentially efficacious adjunct to current smoking cessation treatment models.

Studies in which FMT was provided to IBD patients for IBD management or (Clostridium difficile infection) CDI treatment were included. The primary outcome was the rate of worsening in IBD activity. Results: Twenty-nine studies with 514 FMT-treated IBD patients were included. Range of follow up was 4 weeks to 3 y. The pooled rate of IBD worsening was 14.9% (95% CI 10–21%).

Although not significant  the pooled rate of worsening in IBD activity following FMT for CDI (22.7% (95% CI: 13–36%)) was higher compared with FMT for IBD (11.1% (95% CI 7–17%)). Rates of worsening in IBD after lower GI FMT delivery revealed a higher rate of worsening in IBD activity (16.5% (95% CI: 11–24%)) compared with upper GI delivery (5.6% (95% CI: 2–16%)). Rates of worsening in high quality studies and randomized controls trials (RCTS) suggested a marginal risk of worsening in IBD activity (4.6%  (95% CI: 1.8–11%). Rates of IBD worsening are overall marginal across high quality RCTS. It is unknown if the FMT itself led to the worsening of IBD in this small fraction or if this represents alternative etiologies."

Seven chimpanzees were tested using a computer-controlled task. They were trained to choose the stronger of two options according to the game rules. The chimpanzees first engaged in the paper–rock sessions until they reached the learning criterion. Subsequently  they engaged in the rock–scissors and scissors–paper sessions  before progressing to sessions with all three pairs mixed. Five of the seven chimpanzees completed training after a mean of 307 sessions  which indicates that they learned the circular pattern. The chimpanzees required more scissors–paper sessions (14.29 ± 6.89)  the third learnt pair  than paper–rock (1.71 ± 0.18) and rock–scissors (3.14 ± 0.70) sessions  suggesting they had difficulty finalizing the circularity. The chimpanzees then received generalization tests using new stimuli  which they learned quickly. A similar procedure was performed with children (35–71 months  n = 38) who needed the same number of trials for all three pairs during single-paired sessions. Their accuracy during the mixed-pair sessions improved with age and was better than chance from 50 months of age  which indicates that the ability to solve the transverse patterning problem might develop at around 4 years of age. The present findings show that chimpanzees were able to learn the task but had difficulties with circularity  whereas children learned the task more easily and developed the relevant ability at approximately 4 years of age. Furthermore  the chimpanzees’ performance during the mixed-pair sessions was similar to that of 4-year-old children during the corresponding stage of training."

Spiders behaved in a manner typical of daily activity until totality  when many began taking down webs. After solar reappearance  most spiders that had begun taking down webs rebuilt them. There was no significant difference in the overall activity patterns of spiders during totality across a range of colony sizes. Experimental illumination of part of a colony during totality altered web takedown behavior. While spiders in the darkness of totality began to take down webs  those spiders which were artificially illuminated did not. These observations suggest that the primary environmental cue responsible for the daily rhythm of web building behavior in this species is light level."

Beginning 2 days prior to the eclipse and continuing through the day following the eclipse  data were collected from 1100 to 1300 hours daily. At 1214 hours on the day of the eclipse  when the sky began to darken and the temperature began to decrease  solitary females and females with infants moved to the top of a climbing structure. As the eclipse progressed  additional chimpanzees began to congregate on the climbing structure and to orient their bodies in the direction of the sun and moon. At 1223 hours  during the period of maximum eclipse  the animals continued to orient their bodies toward the sun and moon and to turn their faces upward. One juvenile stood upright and gestured in the direction of the sun and moon. Sunlight began to increase at 1225 hours  and as it became brighter  the animals began to descend from the climbing structure. The behaviors exhibited by the group during the period of maximum eclipse were not observed prior to or following the eclipse nor as darkness approached at normal  daily sunset. These data indicate that a solar eclipse  a rare and uncommon environmental event  can influence and modulate the behavior of chimpanzees."

However  some descriptive studies have reported an increase in inactivity levels and congregation of individuals during a solar eclipse. The aim of the present work was to carry out a systematic study of the effect of a solar eclipse on the behavior of baboons at an individual  gender  and one-male unit (OMU) level. On 3 November 1994  Chile experienced a solar eclipse. A hamadryas baboon colony grouped in two OMUs at the Zoo of Santiago de Chile was observed 2 days before the solar eclipse (control situation)  and during the eclipse for the same time period. Two observers simultaneously sampled the data. An all-occurrence sampling method was used to collect data on threats and attacks made by adult individuals. Simultaneously  instantaneous samplings of 1 min each were used to record behavioral states of the two males and two females. In relation to the control situation  the effect of the solar eclipse on baboon behavior was a reduction in the rates of locomotion and threats  and an increase in the rates of inactivity and grooming  but not significantly so in all the focal individuals. Behavioral changes were more marked in males than in females  but did not differ between the two OMUs. Air temperature and humidity were similar in the two situations  and can therefore be discarded as causal effects on the behavioral changes of the baboons during the eclipse."

We found no differences between measures of objective and subjective social isolation. Results remain consistent across gender  length of follow-up  and world region  but initial health status has an influence on the findings. Results also differ across participant age  with social deficits being more predictive of death in samples with an average age younger than 65 years.

When exposed in the air at room temperature or treated by low temperature annealing  however  transition from superhydrophilicity to superhydrophobicity of the CuO nanowire films are observed. Since the chemical structure of the films after treatment remains the same as CuO according to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra  the superhydrophobicity may be attributed to partial deoxidation of the upmost layer of CuO surfaces into -like hydrophobic surfaces. Nonetheless superhydrophilicity is recovered if the superhydrophobic CuO film is subject to high temperature annealing."

The switchable wettability described in this work allows for facile and precise control over the surface wettability  ranging from superhydrophobic (contact angle about 157°) to superhydrophilic (contact angle less than 10°) with a short response time. The rate of wetting transition and the desired contact angle can be precisely controlled by modulating the magnitude and duration of the applied potential. The wettability alteration is completely reversible when the sample is dried at ambient or heat-dried at 100 °C. The heat-drying does not impact the surface composition when compared to the samples dried at room temperature. The surface contains a mixture of CuO and Cu2O as revealed by the surface composition analysis. The mechanism underlying the wetting alteration is based on the Faradaic phase transformation at the surface. An integrated droplet manipulation system is also demonstrated. The single-step and additive-free sample preparation is scalable and can be used to design smart surfaces and devices that require control over the wettability (e.g.  liquid lenses  microfluidic devices  sensitive particulate matter handling systems  controlled filtration  and biomedical applications)."

However  we have a limited understanding of the overall diversity of these communities  how they differ across surfaces and sources of bacteria to kitchen surfaces. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to explore biogeographical patterns of bacteria across >80 surfaces within the kitchens of each of four households. In total  34 bacterial and two archaeal phyla were identified  with most sequences belonging to the Actinobacteria  Bacteroidetes  Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Genera known to contain common food-borne pathogens were low in abundance but broadly distributed throughout the kitchens  with different taxa exhibiting distinct distribution patterns. The most diverse communities were associated with infrequently cleaned surfaces such as fans above stoves  refrigerator/freezer door seals and floors. In contrast  the least diverse communities were observed in and around sinks  which were dominated by biofilm-forming Gram-negative lineages. Community composition was influenced by conditions on individual surfaces  usage patterns and dispersal from source environments. Human skin was the primary source of bacteria across all kitchen surfaces  with contributions from food and faucet water dominating in a few specific locations. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are widely distributed in residential kitchens and that the composition of these communities is often predictable. These results also illustrate the ease with which human- and food-associated bacteria can be transferred in residential settings to kitchen surfaces."

Stone tools recovered from the central places of the Tongan state were geochemically analyzed to provide the first archaeological assessment of maritime interaction in the Central Pacific  with a high proportion of tools (66%) identified as long-distance imports from Fiji  Samoa  and the Society Islands. Exotic lithics were an important source of political capital used by Tongan elites  and an important consequence of centralization was the development of interaction centers through which people  products  and information about political organizations reached many parts of the prehistoric Pacific. Abstract: Tonga was unique in the prehistoric Pacific for developing a maritime state that integrated the archipelago under a centralized authority and for undertaking long-distance economic and political exchanges in the second millennium A.D. To establish the extent of Tonga’s maritime polity  we geochemically analyzed stone tools excavated from the central places of the ruling paramounts  particularly lithic artifacts associated with stone-faced chiefly tombs. The lithic networks of the Tongan state focused on Samoa and Fiji  with one adze sourced to the Society Islands 2 500 km from Tongatapu. To test the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were especially valued by Tongan elites and were an important source of political capital  we analyzed prestate lithics from Tongatapu and stone artifacts from Samoa. In the Tongan state  66% of worked stone tools were long-distance imports  indicating that interarchipelago connections intensified with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast  stone tools found in Samoa were from local sources  including tools associated with a monumental structure contemporary with the Tongan state. Network analysis of lithics entering the Tongan state and of the distribution of Samoan adzes in the Pacific identified a centralized polity and the products of specialized lithic workshops  respectively. These results indicate that a significant consequence of social complexity was the establishment of new types of specialized sites in distant geographic areas. Specialized sites were loci of long-distance interaction and formed important centers for the transmission of information  people  and materials in prehistoric Oceania."

Both odour sources are presented singly and in combination. Flight upwind along the plumes is evident for both CO2 and odour from human feet when the odours are presented alone. Similarly  both odour sources are located by more than 70% of mosquitoes in less than 3min. When both CO2 and odour from human feet are presented simultaneously in two different choice tests (with plumes superimposed or with plumes separated)  there is no evidence that females orientate along the plume of CO2 and only a few mosquitoes locate its source. Rather  the foot odour plume is navigated and the source of foot odour is located by over 80% of female Ae. aegypti. When a female is presented a plume of CO2 within a broad plume of human foot odour of relatively low concentration  the source of CO2 is not located; instead  flight is upwind in the diffuse plume of foot odour. Although upwind flight by Ae. aegypti at long range is presumably induced by CO2 and the threshold of response to skin odours is lowered  our findings suggest that  once females have arrived near a prospective human host  upwind orientation and landing are largely governed by the suite of human odours  whereas orientation is no longer influenced by CO2."

In Australia  accurate taxonomic information is lacking for several Pleistocene groups  including the largest marsupial ever to live  Diprotodon Owen  1838. Diprotodon taxonomy has been complicated by early nomenclatural problems and by the occurrence of two distinct size classes of individuals that do not reflect an ontogenetic series. Traditionally  the two size classes have been regarded as separate species. However  a taxonomic investigation of large samples (>1000 teeth) of Diprotodon material from several different fossil localities in Queensland  New South Wales  South Australia and Victoria suggests that there is little evidence for the discrimination of more than one morphospecies. Thus  Diprotodon is here considered a monotypic genus and the single morphospecies  D.optatum Owen  1838 is considered to have been highly sexually dimorphic. By drawing analogy with extant sexually dimorphic megaherbivores and marsupials  the large form was probably male  and the small form was probably female. Diprotodon optatum probably moved in small  gender-segregated herds  and exhibited a polygynous breeding strategy. As a single morphospecies  D.optatum had a near-continental geographical distribution  similar to that of extant megaherbivores  possibly indicating its niche as a habitat generalist."

By simple dilution  stable Chinese traditional ink dispersion was obtained  which presents excellent photothermal effect because of its high absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. Meanwhile  as revealed by staining and photoacoustic imaging  Hu-ink could transfer to nearby lymph nodes after directly injected into the primary tumors. Under the guidance of dual-modality mapping  the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes could be subsequently eliminated by NIR irradiation. The good biocompatibility of Hu-ink has also been verified by a series of experiments. Therefore  the Hu-ink-based treatment exhibits great potential for PTT of tumor metastatic lymph nodes in future clinical practice."

Developments in the last 20 years have included the discovery of a fifth class of human visual pigment (melanopsin)  in addition to the three classes of photopsin to be found in the cones and rhodopsin in the rods in the human retina. Melanopsin is found in a small number of retinal ganglion cells which then  in addition to receiving input from rods and cones  are intrinsically photosensitive. These retinal ganglion cells send their input primarily to the hypothalamus  where they help to regulate the circadian system (daily rhythms of sleep patterns  body temperature  heart rate  etc.). The discovery of the anatomical basis of non-image-forming vision has led to a great deal of research into the effects of light on sleep  depression and mood  retinal photodamage and well-being  amongst other factors. Given that recent technological innovations in LED lighting now give us greater control over environmental lighting  it is timely to review the non-visual effects of light in humans in order to inform lighting design in the future."

Verbal models of individual stress “coping style” have proposed that the behav-ioural component of this variation can be described as a single axis  with each indi-vidual’s coping style being consistent across time and stress contexts.3.  Focusing on this behavioural component of stress response and combining repeated measures of multiple traits with a novel multivariate modelling framework  we test for the existence of coping style variation and assess its stability across contexts in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata).4.  Specifically  we test the following hypotheses: (1) there exists repeatable among-individual behavioural (co)variation (“personality”) within a mild stress context con-sistent with a risk-averse–risk-prone continuum of behavioural coping style  (2) there is population-level plasticity in behaviour as a function of stressor severity  (3) there is among-individual variation in plasticity (i.e. IxE)  and (4) the presence of IxE reduces cross-context stability of behavioural coping style.5.  We found significant repeatable among-individual behavioural (co)variation in the mild stress context (open field trial)  represented as an I matrix. However  I was not readily described by a simple risk-averse–risk-prone continuum as posited by the original coping style model. We also found strong evidence for population-level changes in mean behaviour with increasing stressor severity (simulated avian and piscine predation risks).6.  Single-trait analyses did show the presence of individual-by-environment interac-tions (IxE)  as among-individual cross-context correlations were significantly less than +1. However  multitrait analysis revealed the consequences of this plasticity variation were minimal. Specifically  we found little evidence for changes in the structure of I between mild and moderate stress contexts overall  and only minor changes between the two moderate contexts (avian vs. piscine predator).7.  We show that a multivariate approach to assessing changes in among-individual (co)variance across contexts can prevent the over-interpretation of statistically significant  but  small   individual-by-environment  effects.

Among possible colonization scenarios  our results are most consistent with human introduction at least 5100 bp (confirmed by radiocarbon dating). We used approximate Bayesian computation of population history to infer the coast of Belgium as the possible source and estimated the evolutionary timescale using a Bayesian coalescent approach. We showed substantial morphological divergence of the island populations  including a size increase presumably driven by selection and reduced microsatellite variation likely reflecting founder events and genetic drift. More surprisingly  our results suggest that a recent and widespread cytb replacement event in the continental source area purged cytb variation there  whereas the ancestral diversity is largely retained in the colonized islands as a genetic ‘ark’. The replacement event in the continental M. arvalis was probably triggered by anthropogenic causes (land-use change).

Dickinsonia is interpreted to be sessile because adjacent specimens show reaction rims indicative of competitive interaction  and because no overlapping well-preserved specimens have ever been found. Folded and bent Dickinsonia reveal firm attachment and limited flexibility  but no brittle deformation indicative of pyritic  sideritic or calcitic ‘death masks’ or xenophyophoran agglutinate skeletons. Dickinsonia was resistant to compaction by overburden  like fossil lichens such as Spongiophyton and Thucomyces  and more compaction-resistant than fossil logs  jellyfish or worms. Dickinsonia also shows indeterminate growth like lichens  fungi  plants  xenophyophorans and colonial animals. Growth  decay and burial compaction of Dickinsonia were more like those of plants  lichens and fungi  than of worms  jellyfishes or anemones."

The line drawings are either viewed from the back  from the front  or randomly alternating between the back and front views. The sample consisted of 322 male and female subjects  split into four different groups  from children to old adults. The results showed increasing performance from children to young adults  with a decline in performance in the old adults (&gt;50 years). The condition with alternating frontback views was the most difficult  particularly when the figure also had both arms crossing the vertical body midline. There were no gender differences except for better male performance in the young adults group (18–22 years). The results are discussed in relation to theories of mental rotation and lateralization of information processing strategies  in addition to rightleft discrimination across the age groups."

        "text": "Context: Medical students can have difficulty in distinguishing left from right. Many infamous medical errors have occurred when a procedure has been performed on the wrong side  such as in the removal of the wrong kidney. Clinicians encounter many distractions during their work. There is limited information on how these affect performance. Objectives: Using a neuropsychological paradigm  we aim to elucidate the impacts of different types of distraction on left–right (LR) discrimination ability. Methods: Medical students were recruited to a study with four arms: (i) control arm (no distraction); (ii) auditory distraction arm (continuous ambient ward noise); (iii) cognitive distraction arm (interruptions with clinical cognitive tasks)  and (iv) auditory and cognitive distraction arm. Participants’ LR discrimination ability was measured using the validated Bergen Left–Right Discrimination Test (BLRDT). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the impacts of the different forms of distraction on participants’ performance on the BLRDT. Additional analyses looked at effects of demographics on performance and correlated participants’ self-perceived LR discrimination ability and their actual performance. Results: A total of 234 students were recruited. Cognitive distraction had a greater negative impact on BLRDT performance than auditory distraction. Combined auditory and cognitive distraction had a negative impact on performance  but only in the most difficult LR task was this negative impact found to be significantly greater than that of cognitive distraction alone. There was a significant medium-sized correlation between perceived LR discrimination ability and actual overall BLRDT performance. Conclusions: Distraction has a significant impact on performance and multifaceted approaches are required to reduce LR errors. Educationally  greater emphasis on the linking of theory and clinical application is required to support patient safety and human factor training in medical school curricula. Distraction has the potential to impair an individual's ability to make accurate LR decisions and students should be trained from undergraduate level to be mindful of this."

Patients (N=129) were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to the two treatment conditions. They were assessed at 6-monthly intervals during the 18 months of treatment and at 24  30 and 42 months during follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)  with complete remission defined as a HDRS-17 score ≤8  and partial remission defined as a HDRS-17 score ≤12. Secondary outcome measures included self-reported depression as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory - II  social functioning as evaluated by the Global Assessment of Functioning  subjective wellbeing as rated by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure  and satisfaction with general activities as assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Complete remission was infrequent in both groups at the end of treatment (9.4% in the LTPP group vs. 6.5% in the control group) as well as at 42-month follow-up (14.9% vs. 4.4%). Partial remission was not significantly more likely in the LTPP than in the control group at the end of treatment (32.1% vs. 23.9%  p=0.37)  but significant differences emerged during follow-up (24 months: 38.8% vs. 19.2%  p=0.03; 30 months: 34.7% vs. 12.2%  p=0.008; 42 months: 30.0% vs. 4.4%  p=0.001). Both observer-based and self-reported depression scores showed steeper declines in the LTPP group  alongside greater improvements on measures of social adjustment. These data suggest that LTPP can be useful in improving the long-term outcome of treatment-resistant depression. End-of-treatment evaluations or short follow-ups may miss the emergence of delayed therapeutic benefit."

We find strong evidence for an m=32 perturbation with a mean amplitude of radial variation of 4.5 km. Phase analysis yields a pattern speed consistent with the mean motion of Prometheus  indicating that this pattern is generated by the 32:31 Inner Lindblad resonance with Prometheus. In addition  we find evidence of 18-lobed and 20-lobed patterns with amplitudes of ~1.5 km. These patterns  whose rotation rates correspond to resonance locations ~4 km interior to the gap edge  are believed to be normal modes. The former is probably related to the nearby 18:17 (m=18) resonance with Pandora. In addition to these resonant and normal mode patterns  we also observe multiple localized features that appear to move at the local keplerian rate and that persist for only a few months. One hypothesis is that different groups of ring particles at the inner edge of the gap may be reacting differently to the resonance with Prometheus  with local variations in the forced eccentricity and/or pericenter; an alternative hypothesis is the existence of several unseen objects embedded at or near the inner edge of the Keeler gap  similar to those suspected to exist at the outer edges of the A and B rings (Spitale and Porco 2009  2010). In either case  observations of the ring edge at opposite ansae demonstrate that the localized features must be on eccentric orbits."

On a ranch in south-central Kenya  we quantified habitat differences of male and female giraffe groups and showed that the preference for open habitats by female groups was limited to groups with young. We suggest that this difference is due to the avoidance of predators of young giraffes. We also showed that rates of giraffe feeding peaked at intermediate feeding heights equal to approximately 60% of adult giraffe height. In the dense habitats with a variety of tree heights used by male groups and female groups without young  both male and female giraffes fed most at heights where they could feed fastest. However  in the open habitats used by female groups with young  females fed mostly at heights below optimum because these habitats are dominated by short food plants. On the other hand  the dominant males accompanying these female groups fed at heights above optimum on rare tall trees  possibly to increase intrasexual vigilance. Apparently  both male and female giraffes sometimes forfeit feeding efficiency tor short-term reproductive gains."

Laetrile and amygdalin are promoted under various names for the treatment of cancer although there is no evidence for its efficacy. Due to possible cyanide poisoning  laetrile can be dangerous. Objectives: To assess the alleged anti‐cancer effect and possible adverse effects of laetrile and amygdalin. Search methods: We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2014  Issue 9); MEDLINE (1951‐2014); EMBASE (1980‐2014); AMED; Scirus; CINAHL (all from 1982‐2015); CAMbase (from 1998‐2015); the MetaRegister; the National Research Register; and our own files. We examined reference lists of included studies and review articles and we contacted experts in the field for knowledge of additional studies. We did not impose any restrictions of timer or language. Searches updated June 2018 and no new studies identified. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Data collection and analysis: We searched eight databases and two registers for studies testing laetrile or amygdalin for the treatment of cancer. Two review authors screened and assessed articles for inclusion criteria. Main results: We located over 200 references  63 were evaluated in the original review  6 in the 2011 and none in this update. However  we did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions: The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin  especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative."

In addition  hurricane statistics from the same period (intensity  date of generation  location  and maximum winds) were obtained from the National Hurricane Center database. We first show that the areal coverage of cold clouds (with brightness temperatures Tb<−50°C) in tropical Africa is a good indicator of the monthly number of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) leaving the west coast of tropical Africa. Furthermore  the AEWs that develop into tropical storms have a significantly larger area covered by cold cloud tops compared with nondeveloping waves.

The announcement in March of Pluto’s discovery was a moment of excitement for both scientists and the public. Clyde Tombaugh was born on February 4  1906 in Illinois  and grew up on a farm in Kansas. He became interested in astronomy as a teenager after observing craters on the moon and rings around Saturn through his uncle’s three inch telescope. The family soon ordered a better telescope to encourage their son’s interests. When he was 20  Clyde Tombaugh began building his own telescopes. By 1928 Tombaugh had built his third backyard telescope and used it to make drawings of Mars and Jupiter. He sent these to Vesto M. Slipher  the director of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff  Arizona  asking for comments. After a short correspondence  Slipher offered him a job at the observatory. His task would be to search for “Planet X.” Planet X had been predicted by Percival Lowell. Lowell  a businessman and astronomer known for his belief that a network of canals existed on Mars and was evidence of an intelligent alien civilization  built the Lowell Observatory to prove his theory. But as it became more and more clear that there was no evidence for that theory  he began to focus on searching for a new planet. Lowell had observed some peculiarity in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus and figured there must be another planet with a mass comparable to Neptune’s orbiting the sun beyond Neptune. Lowell searched for the planet  which he called Planet X  from 1905 to his death in 1916. For years after Lowell’s death  the Lowell observatory was hampered by an expensive legal battle with Lowell’s widow. In 1927 the observatory was ready to resume the search for Planet X  and it acquired a new 13 inch refracting telescope for the search. Slipher assigned the task to Tombaugh  who arrived in Flagstaff in January 1929. First  he had to use the telescope to make many photographic plates  systematically taking pictures of regions of the night sky where the new planet might appear. For each region  Tombaugh made two photos  taken several days apart. He spent many cold nights in the unheated observatory dome carefully making the observations. After creating many such pairs of plates  he would compare the two members of each pair. Distant stars would appear in the same position on both plates  but a planet would have moved in the several days between the two exposures. Tombaugh used a device called a blinking comparator to make the comparison. The device would present him with sections of the two photo plates to be compared  shifting between the two several times a second. Most of the time the photos were the same and Tombaugh would see nothing  but if an object had moved between the two exposures  Tombaugh would see a blink."

Although a BTX receptor has been delimited within the inner cavity of Na+ channels  how Na+ ions flow through the BTX-bound permeation pathway remains unclear. In this report we tested a hypothesis that Na+ ions traverse a narrow gap between bound BTX and residue N927 at D2S6 of cardiac hNav1.5 Na+ channels. We found that BTX at 5 uM indeed elicited a strong block of hNav1.5-N927K currents (~70%) after 1000 repetitive pulses (+50 mV/20 ms at 2 Hz) without any effects on Na+ channel gating. Once occurred  this unique use-dependent block of hNav1.5-N927K Na+ channels recovered little at holding potential (−140 mV)  demonstrating that BTX block is irreversible under our experimental conditions. Such an irreversible effect likewise developed in fast inactivation-deficient hNav1.5-N927K Na+ channels albeit with a faster on-rate; ~90% of peak Na+ currents were abolished by BTX after 200 repetitive pulses (+50 mV/20 ms). This use-dependent block of fast inactivation-deficient hNav1.5-N927K Na+ channels by BTX was duration dependent. The longer the pulse duration the larger the block developed. Among N927K/W/R/H/D/S/Q/G/E substitutions in fast inactivation-deficient hNav1.5 Na+ channels  only N927K/R Na+ currents were highly sensitive to BTX block. We conclude that (a) BTX binds within the inner cavity and partly occludes the permeation pathway and (b) residue hNav1.5-N927 is critical for ion permeation between bound BTX and D2S6  probably because the side-chain of N927 helps coordinate permeating Na+ ions."

The Niagara River receives PPCPs from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) situated along the river and Lake Erie.

We examined whether these periods of “mind wandering” are associated with reduced cortical analysis of the external environment. Participants performed a sustained attention to response task in which they responded to frequent “nontargets” (digits 0–9) and withheld responses for infrequent “targets” (the letter X). Mind wandering was defined both behaviorally  indicated by a failure to withhold a response to a target  and subjectively  via self-report at a thought probe. The P300 event-related potential component for nontargets was reduced prior to both the behavioral and subjective reports of mind wandering  relative to periods of being “on-task.” Regression analysis of P300 amplitude revealed significant common variance between behavioral and subjective markers of mind wandering  suggesting that both markers reflect a common underlying mental state. Finally  control analysis revealed that the effect of mind wandering on the P300 could not be ascribed to changes in motor activity nor was it associated with general arousal. Our data suggest that when trying to engage attention in a sustained manner  the mind will naturally ebb and flow in the depth of cognitive analysis it applies to events in the external environment."

Compared with engaging in a demanding task  rest  or no break  engaging in an undemanding task during an incubation period led to substantial improvements in performance on previously encountered problems. Critically  the context that improved performance after the incubation period was associated with higher levels of mind wandering but not with a greater number of explicitly directed thoughts about the UUT.

We study the three-dimensional distribution of atmospheric H2O for synchronously rotating Earth-sized aquaplanets using the general circulation model (GCM) ROCKE-3D  and examine the effects of total incident flux and stellar spectral type. We observe a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to increased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest  in qualitative agreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar point previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets. However  the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to increase while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by the circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating due to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles  causing efficient vertical transport of water vapor. Consistently  the water vapor mixing ratio is found to be well-correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident flux. We also simulate transmission spectra based on the GCM outputs  and show that for the more highly irradiated planets  the H2O signatures may be strengthened by a factor of a few  loosening the observational demands for a H2O detection."

The effect of acute alcohol consumption on perceived foreign language performance and actual foreign language performance in foreign language learners has not been investigated. The aim of the current study was to test the effects of acute alcohol consumption on self-rated and observer-rated verbal foreign language performance in participants who have recently learned this language. Methods: Fifty native German speakers who had recently learned Dutch were randomized to receive either a low dose of alcohol or a control beverage that contained no alcohol. Following the experimental manipulation  participants took part in a standardized discussion in Dutch with a blinded experimenter. The discussion was audio-recorded and foreign language skills were subsequently rated by two native Dutch speakers who were blind to the experimental condition (observer-rating). Participants also rated their own individual Dutch language skills during the discussion (self-rating). Results: Participants who consumed alcohol had significantly better observer-ratings for their Dutch language  specifically better pronunciation  compared with those who did not consume alcohol. However  alcohol had no effect on self-ratings of Dutch language skills. Conclusions: Acute alcohol consumption may have beneficial effects on the pronunciation of a foreign language in people who have recently learned that language."

We use 10 months of ambient seismic noise cross correlations from 30 temporary seismic stations to obtain a 3-D model of shear wave velocity anomalies beneath Lusi  the neighboring Arjuno-Welirang volcanic complex  and the Watukosek fault system connecting the two. Our work reveals a hydrothermal plume  rooted at a minimum 6 km depth that reaches the surface at the Lusi site. Furthermore  the inversion shows that this vertical anomaly is connected to the adjacent volcanic complex through a narrow (~3 km wide) low velocity corridor slicing the survey area at a depth of ~4–6 km. The NE-SW direction of this elongated zone matches the strike of the Watukosek fault system. Distinct magmatic chambers are also inferred below the active volcanoes. The large-scale tomography features an exceptional example of a subsurface connection between a volcanic complex and a solitary erupting hydrothermal system hosted in a hydrocarbon-rich back-arc sedimentary basin. These results are consistent with a scenario where deep-seated fluids (e.g.  magmas and released hydrothermal fluids) flow along a region of enhanced transmissivity (i.e.  the Watukosek fault system damage zone) from the volcanic arc toward the back arc basin where Lusi resides. The triggered metamorphic reactions occurring at depth in the organic-rich sediments generated significant overpressure and fluid upwelling that is today released at the spectacular Lusi eruption site."

The incremental microseismic energy above an absolute minimum activity as a function of wind direction  for a given fixed wind speed  correlates with the average fetch of the wind over the lake  indicating that the source of microseisms is the lake itself. The sensitivity to fetch effects is similar for both onshore and offshore stations indicating that shoaling is probably not a source.

The lakes span more than 2 orders of magnitude in size (areas of 210–27 000 km2) and sample a range of climatic and tectonic regimes in Canada  the U.S.  and China. Lake-generated microseisms create spectral peaks at periods near 1 s and are often polarized as Rayleigh waves propagating away from the lake. In contrast to ocean-generated microseisms  lake-generated microseisms are only observed within about 25–30 km of the shoreline. This is consistent with the well-known high attenuation of short-period Rayleigh waves (Rg). It is unclear if lake-generated microseisms are produced by a linear shoaling process  analogous to primary ocean microseisms  or a nonlinear wave-wave interaction process  analogous to secondary ocean microseisms. If they are mainly produced by shoaling  lake-generated microseisms might provide a spatially integrated measure of shoreline erosion. Regardless of the source mechanism  lake-generated microseisms appear to provide a record of ice phenology for lakes that freeze in the winter. Such data could contribute to assessing the effects of climate change on high-latitude lakes in remote areas. Finally  it is likely that lake-generated microseisms are useful for imaging the geological structure of the shallow crust  information that is important for quantifying seismic hazard and can be difficult to obtain in urban areas where active source imaging is not feasible."

The objective of this study was to characterize prehistoric human diets to shed light on human adaptability and land use in an island environment with limited resources. Materials and methods: Materials for this study included human  faunal  and botanical remains from the archaeological sites Anakena and Ahu Tepeu on Rapa Nui  dating from c. 1400 AD to the historic period  and modern reference material. We used bulk carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses and amino acid compound specific isotope analyses (AA-CSIA) of collagen isolated from prehistoric human and faunal bone  to assess the use of marine versus terrestrial resources and to investigate the underlying baseline values. Similar isotope analyses of archaeological and modern botanical and marine samples were used to characterize the local environment. Results: Results of carbon and nitrogen AA-CSIA independently show that around half the protein in diets from the humans measured came from marine sources; markedly higher than previous estimates. We also observed higher δ15N values in human collagen than could be expected from the local environment. Discussion: Our results suggest highly elevated δ15N values could only have come from consumption of crops grown in substantially manipulated soils. These findings strongly suggest that the prehistoric population adapted and exhibited astute environmental awareness in a harsh environment with nutrient poor soils. Our results also have implications for evaluating marine reservoir corrections of radiocarbon dates."

However  it remains unclear whether these open ocean wind speeds are higher because of lack of surface drag or whether a greater downward transport of kinetic energy may be sustained in open ocean environments. Focusing on the North Atlantic region  we provide evidence that there is potential for greater downward transport of kinetic energy in the overlying atmosphere. As a result  wind power generation over some ocean areas can exceed power generation on land by a factor of three or more. Abstract: Wind turbines continuously remove kinetic energy from the lower troposphere  thereby reducing the wind speed near hub height. The rate of electricity generation in large wind farms containing multiple wind arrays is  therefore  constrained by the rate of kinetic energy replenishment from the atmosphere above. In recent years  a growing body of research argues that the rate of generated power is limited to around 1.5 W m−2 within large wind farms. However  in this study  we show that considerably higher power generation rates may be sustainable over some open ocean areas. In particular  the North Atlantic is identified as a region where the downward transport of kinetic energy may sustain extraction rates of 6 W m−2 and above over large areas in the annual mean. Furthermore  our results indicate that the surface heat flux from the oceans to the atmosphere may play an important role in creating regions where sustained high rates of downward transport of kinetic energy and thus  high rates of kinetic energy extraction may be geophysical possible. While no commercial-scale deep water wind farms yet exist  our results suggest that such technologies  if they became technically and economically feasible  could potentially provide civilization-scale power."

Younger deposits also contained tools with S. jamesii granules  indicating at least 4 000 years of intermittent use. Ethnographic and historical accounts from the region extend the period of use to more than 10 000 years. Given this long prehistory and history  the question arises as to whether some S. jamesii populations could have undergone transport  cultivation  and eventual domestication over such a long period of time. Abstract: The prehistory of wild potato use  leading to its domestication and diversification  has been well-documented in  and confined to  South America. At least 20 tuber-bearing  wild species of Solanum are known from North and Central America  yet their importance in ancient diets has never been assessed from the archaeological record. Here  we report the earliest evidence of wild potato use in North America at 10 900–10 100 calendar years (cal) B.P. in the form of well-preserved starch granules extracted from ground stone tools at North Creek Shelter  southern Utah. These granules have been identified as those of Solanum jamesii Torr. (Four Corners potato)  a tuber-bearing species native to the American Southwest. Identification was based on applying five strictly defined diagnostic characteristics (eccentric hilum  longitudinal fissure  lack of fissure branching  fissure ratio  and maximum granule size) to each of 323 archaeological granules. Of those  nine were definitively assigned to S. jamesii based on possession of all characteristics  and another 61 were either likely or possibly S. jamesii depending on the number of characteristics they possessed. The oldest granules were found in substratum 4k (10 900–10 100 cal B.P.). Younger deposits  dating to ∼6 900 cal B.P.  also contained tools with S. jamesii granules  indicating at least 4 000 y of intermittent use. Ethnographic and historical accounts extend the period of use to more than 10 000 y. The question then arises as to whether some S. jamesii populations could have undergone transport  cultivation  and eventual domestication over such a long period of time."

We predicted that beyond conveying the contents of a person’s mind  a person’s speech also conveys mental capacity  such that hearing a person explain his or her beliefs makes the person seem more mentally capable—and therefore seem to possess more uniquely human mental traits—than reading the same content. We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless  such as when they disagree with the evaluator’s own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities. These results suggest that the medium through which people communicate may systematically influence the impressions they form of each other. The tendency to denigrate the minds of the opposition may be tempered by giving them  quite literally  a voice."

It was around 500 B.C. that Pythagoras first proposed a spherical Earth  mainly on aesthetic grounds rather than on any physical evidence. Like many Greeks  he believed the sphere was the most perfect shape. Possibly the first to propose a spherical Earth based on actual physical evidence was Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)  who listed several arguments for a spherical Earth: ships disappear hull first when they sail over the horizon  Earth casts a round shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse  and different constellations are visible at different latitudes. Around this time Greek philosophers had begun to believe the world could be explained by natural processes rather than invoking the gods  and early astronomers began making physical measurements  in part to better predict the seasons. The first person to determine the size of Earth was Eratosthenes of Cyrene  who produced a surprisingly good measurement using a simple scheme that combined geometrical calculations with physical observations. Eratosthenes was born around 276 B.C.  which is now Shahhat  Libya. He studied in Athens at the Lyceum. Around 240 B.C.

In the context of aquatic species  dispersal modeling needs to consider that most freshwater ecosystems are highly fragmented by barriers reducing longitudinal connectivity. Previous research has incorporated such barriers into dispersal models under the neutral assumption that all migrating animals attempt to ascend at all times. Modeling dispersal of animals that do not perform trophic or reproductive migrations will be more realistic if it includes assumptions of which individuals attempt to overcome a barrier. We aimed to introduce personality into predictive modeling of whether a nonmigratory invasive freshwater fish (the round goby  Neogobius melanostomus) will disperse across an in-stream barrier. To that end  we experimentally assayed the personalities of 259 individuals from invasion fronts and established round goby populations. Based on the population differences in boldness  asociability  and activity  we defined a priori thresholds with bolder  more asocial  and more active individuals having a higher likelihood of ascent. We then combined the personality thresholds with swimming speed data from the literature and in situ measurements of flow velocities in the barrier. The resulting binary logistic regression model revealed probabilities of crossing a barrier which depended not only on water flow and fish swimming speed but also on animal personalities. We conclude that risk assessment through predictive dispersal modeling across fragmented landscapes can be advanced by including personality traits as parameters. The inclusion of behavior into modeling the spread of invasive species can help to improve the accuracy of risk assessments."

Surveys have shown that <5 mm plastic particles  known as microplastics  are significantly more abundant in surface seawater and on shorelines than larger plastic particles are. Nevertheless  quantification of microplastics in the environment is hampered by a lack of adequate high-throughput methods for distinguishing and quantifying smaller size fractions (<1 mm)  and this has probably resulted in an underestimation of actual microplastic concentrations. Here we present a protocol that allows high-throughput detection and automated quantification of small microplastic particles (20–1000 μm) using the dye Nile red  fluorescence microscopy  and image analysis software. This protocol has proven to be highly effective in the quantification of small polyethylene  polypropylene  polystyrene  and nylon-6 particles  which frequently occur in the water column. Our preliminary results from sea surface tows show a power-law increase in small microplastics (i.e.  <1 mm) with a decreasing particle size. Hence  our data help to resolve speculation about the “apparent” loss of this fraction from surface waters. We consider that this method presents a step change in the ability to detect small microplastics by substituting the subjectivity of human visual sorting with a sensitive and semiautomated procedure."

Its asymmetric slow accumulation of strain and rapid release is quite unlike the harmonic motion of a pendulum and need not be time predictable  but still resembles a class of repeating systems known as integrate-and-fire oscillators  whose behavior has been shown to demonstrate a remarkable ability to synchronize to either external or self-organized forcing. Given sufficient time and even very weak physical coupling  the phases of sets of such oscillators  with similar though not necessarily identical period  approach each other. Topological and time series analyses presented here demonstrate that earthquakes worldwide show evidence of such synchronization. Though numerous studies demonstrate that the composite temporal distribution of major earthquakes in the instrumental record is indistinguishable from random  the additional consideration of event renewal interval serves to identify earthquake groupings suggestive of synchronization that are absent in synthetic catalogs. We envisage the weak forces responsible for clustering originate from lithospheric strain induced by seismicity itself  by finite strains over teleseismic distances  or by other sources of lithospheric loading such as Earth's variable rotation. For example  quasi-periodic maxima in rotational deceleration are accompanied by increased global seismicity at multidecadal intervals."

We conducted a three-year field experiment in which each of these lighting strategies was simulated in a previously artificial light naïve grassland ecosystem. White LEDs both increased the total abundance and changed the assemblage composition of adult spiders and beetles. Dimming LEDs by 50% or manipulating their spectra to reduce ecologically damaging wavelengths partially reduced the number of commoner species affected from seven to four. A combination of dimming by 50% and switching lights off between midnight and 04:00 am showed the most promise for reducing the ecological costs of LEDs  but the abundances of two otherwise common species were still affected. The environmental consequences of using alternative lighting technologies are increasingly well established. These results suggest that while management strategies using LEDs can be an effective means of reducing the number of taxa affected  averting the ecological impacts of night-time lighting may ultimately require avoiding its use altogether."

The affinity‐seeking construct describes ways people get others to like and feel positive about them. The research is grounded in the presumption that people attempt to generate liking by using various communication strategies. Four questions were addressed in six studies: (1) How do people attempt to generate liking? (2) What is the relationship of affinity‐seeking to interpersonal attraction? (3) How do individual differences and situational contingencies constrain affinity‐seeking? and (4) What is the multivariate structure of affinity‐seeking? An inductively‐devised typology of affinity‐seeking strategies provided a reliable operationalization of the construct. Affinity‐seeking was strongly and positively related to interpersonal attraction  life satisfaction  and social effectiveness. In addition  strategy knowledge and strategy preferences were related to various personality variables and situational contingencies. The final investigation reported in this article identified three dimensions underlying the typology and seven general clusters of strategies."

We have also carried out molecular dynamics computer simulations of nanometer‐sized drops  which show the same qualitative behavior in the case of an applied shear. At the other extreme  persistent non‐coalescence of larger drops was observed in microgravity conditions in a space shuttle experiment. We give an explanation of the experimental observations based upon lubrication theory and simple continuum hydrodynamics arguments  along with complementary microscopic insight obtained from the molecular simulations."

Electron burst characteristics shown in this paper include the dependence of the precipitation on magnetic local time  radial distance and geomagnetic activity. Precipitation bursts with timescales <1 s  i.e.  microbursts  are studied in detail  including their dependence on the phases of geomagnetic storms. It is found that precipitation bursts occur typically in the region between L = 4 and L = 6. Microbursts tend to occur at L lower than the bursts with timescales of several tens of seconds. The number of observed microbursts significantly increases during storms  appearing mainly in the morning sector early in the recovery phase of storms. These findings suggest that the microbursts may be due to interactions with electron whistler waves  which take place near the dawnside plasmapause in the density irregularities that are perhaps created in the “recovering” plasmasphere. The prevalence of bursty precipitation indicates that this enhanced loss component of the relativistic electron flux should be taken into account in any quantitative model of relativistic electron acceleration processes."

On 20 January 2016 near 1944 UT the low Earth orbiting CubeSat Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Bursts: Intensity  Range  and Dynamics (FIREBIRD II) observed energetic microbursts (near L = 5.6 and MLT = 10.5) from its lower limit of 220 keV  to 1 MeV. In the outer radiation belt and magnetically conjugate  Van Allen Probe A observed rising-tone  lower band chorus waves with durations and cadences similar to the microbursts. No other waves were observed. This is the first time that chorus and microbursts have been simultaneously observed with a separation smaller than a chorus packet. A majority of the microbursts do not have the energy dispersion expected for trapped electrons bouncing between mirror points. This confirms that the electrons are rapidly (nonlinearly) scattered into the loss cone by a coherent interaction with the large amplitude (up to ∼900 pT) chorus. Comparison of observed time-averaged microburst flux and estimated total electron drift shell content at L = 5.6 indicate that microbursts may represent a significant source of energetic electron loss in the outer radiation belt."

Here  we explore the mechanisms by which the adult insect head has been able to integrate novel traits and features during its ontogeny  focusing on the cephalic horns of Onthophagus beetles. Specifically  using a microablation approach we investigate how different regions of the dorsal head of adult horned beetles relate to their larval and embryonic counterparts and test whether deeply conserved regional boundaries that establish the embryonic head might also facilitate or bias the positioning of cephalic horns along the dorsal adult head. We find that paired posterior horns—the most widespread horn type within the genus—are positioned along a border homologous to the embryonic clypeolabral (CL)–ocular boundary  and that this placement constitutes the ancestral form of horn positioning. In contrast  we observed that the phylogenetically much rarer anterior horns are positioned by larval head regions contained firmly within the CL segment and away from any major preexisting larval head landmarks or boundaries. Lastly  we describe the unexpected finding that ablations at medial head regions can result in ectopic outgrowths bearing terminal structures resembling the more anterior clypeal ridge. We discuss our results in the light of the developmental genetic mechanisms of head formation in holometabolous insects and the role of co-option in innovation and bias in developmental evolution."

Studies 2 and 3 show that the emotional rewards associated with giving to friends or acquaintances are greatest in situations that facilitate social connection.

The most influential are aspects of the payoff function (especially the social gain from cooperation and the risk associated with a cooperative move)  the number of players  repetitions of the game  group vs. individual decisions  and players’ social value orientations (SVOs).

We vary impact angle  sediment thickness and porosity  water depth  and shock pressure for devolatilization and present the results in a dimensionless form so that the released gases can be estimated for any impact into a sedimentary target.

In Australia  dingoes are the mainland apex predator and play an important role in ecological functioning. Currently  however  they are threatened by hybridization with modern domestic dogs in the wild. As a consequence  we explore how increasing our understanding of the evolutionary history of dingoes can inform management and conservation decisions. Previous research on whole mitochondrial genome and nuclear data from five geographical populations showed evidence of two distinct lineages of dingo. Here  we present data from a broader survey of dingoes around Australia using both mitochondrial and Y chromosome markers and investigate the timing of demographic expansions. Biogeographic data corroborate the presence of at least two geographically subdivided genetic populations  southeastern and northwestern. Demographic modeling suggests that dingoes have undergone population expansion in the last 5 000 years. It is not clear whether this stems from expansion into vacant niches after the extinction of thylacines on the mainland or indicates the arrival date of dingoes. Male dispersal is much more common than female  evidenced by more diffuse Y haplogroup distributions. There is also evidence of likely historical male biased introgression from domestic dogs into dingoes  predominately within southeastern Australia. These findings have critical practical implications for the management and conservation of dingoes in Australia; particularly a focus must be placed upon the threatened southeastern dingo population."

It has been found that temporal variations of the F1 layer and D region are mainly controlled by local solar radiation. Quantitative analysis of the variations of the F1 layer critical frequency  ƒ0F1  shows that electrons are removed from the F1 layer through ionic recombination. However  the temporal variations of ƒ>0F2 and electron density above 200 km show that the variations of the F2 layer around the equatorial anomaly region are controlled not by local solar radiation but by solar radiation at the equator. The fountain effect plays an important role even during the solar eclipse. The VLF propagation time delay is controlled by the variations of average path obscuration.

Methods. Our analysis is based on data from a random-digit dialed national telephone survey of U.S. adults conducted in 1994. We examine differences in factor structure of values for a group of 145 white men and 200 white women using confirmatory factor analysis and differences in mean value scores using multivariate analysis of variance. Results. We find no substantial differences in value factor structure  but differences in value priorities  with women ranking altruism as more important than men. Conclusions. Our analysis supports work that focuses on mean differences in environmentalism across genders without examining gender differences in factor structure  although further examination of gender differences in factor structure is warranted. Our results also highlight the importance of gender differences in altruism as a basis for gender differences in environmentalism. "

Partly as a result of a pair of influential papers published in ES&T  scientists are now exploring the role that fragments of plastic trash may play in transporting marine pollutants. The first international conference about this newly emerging “microplastics” problem was held in September and sponsored by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Attendees from six countries agreed to define microplastics as plastic pieces or fragments smaller than 5 millimeters. Sources of microplastics include both the small plastic particles used in products like body washes and cosmetics and the weathering of larger plastic flotsam and jetsam  says conference organizer Joel Baker of the University of Washington Tacoma  where the event was held. Larger plastic debris tends mainly to float on the surface  but microplastics also can be found in the water column and on the seabed  says Richard Thompson  a researcher at Plymouth University (U.K.) and a coauthor of both ES&T papers. “This distribution  together with the smaller size  means that a wider variety of organisms could be exposed to [microplastics] ” he says. Thompson has been at the forefront of developing methods to definitively identify plastic fragments as small as 20 micrometers. As plastic items break down  any toxic additives they contain—including flame retardants  antimicrobials  and plasticizers—may be released into the ocean environment  Thompson explains. Plastics can act like sponges to collect hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants  such as PCBs  adds Holly Bamford  director of NOAA’s Marine Debris Program. Microplastic particles have been shown to hold concentrations of PCBs more than 1 million times higher than those in the surrounding water  Baker says."

This review looks at the technological advancement made in the development of more easily biodegradable plastics and the biodegradation of conventional plastics by microorganisms. Additives  such as pro-oxidants and starch  are applied in synthetic materials to modify and make plastics biodegradable. Recent research has shown that thermoplastics derived from polyolefins  traditionally considered resistant to biodegradation in ambient environment  are biodegraded following photo-degradation and chemical degradation. Thermoset plastics  such as aliphatic polyester and polyester polyurethane  are easily attacked by microorganisms directly because of the potential hydrolytic cleavage of ester or urethane bonds in their structures. Some microorganisms have been isolated to utilize polyurethane as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen source. Aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters have active commercial applications because of their good mechanical properties and biodegradability. Reviewing published and ongoing studies on plastic biodegradation  this paper attempts to make conclusions on potentially viable methods to reduce impacts of plastic waste on the environment."

Using New Zealand census data from 1966–2006  we develop a Bayesian predictive model to forecast the proportion of the population identifying as Christian in the future. A surprisingly simple linear model revealed that Christian affiliation in New Zealand has been steadily declining at a constant rate of around 0.90% per year since 1966. The model explained 97.4% of the variance in proportional change in the New Zealand Christian population over the past half-century. The model also offers testable predictions. We estimate that 46.1% of the population will identify as Christian in New Zealand in 2015  with a further decline to 41.7% by 2020. The 95% credible interval for the 2015 estimate is between 42.5% and 49.6%. The 95% credible interval for the 2020 estimate is between 37.7% and 45.8%.

In the absence of body fossils  emphasis may instead be given to microbially derived features  such as microbialite growth patterns  microbial mat morphologies  and the presence of fossilized gas bubbles in lithified mats. The metabolic affinity of micro-organisms associated with phosphatization may reveal important clues to the nature and accretion of apatite-rich microbialites. Stromatolites from the 1.6 Ga Chitrakoot Formation (Semri Group  Vindhyan Supergroup) in central India contain abundant fossilized bubbles interspersed within fine-grained in situ-precipitated apatite mats with average δ13Corg indicative of carbon fixation by the Calvin cycle. In addition  the mats hold a synsedimentary fossil biota characteristic of cyanobacterial and rhodophyte morphotypes. Phosphatic oncoid cone-like stromatolites from the Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup (Jhamarkotra Formation) comprise abundant mineralized bubbles enmeshed within tufted filamentous mat fabrics. Construction of these tufts is considered to be the result of filamentous bacteria gliding within microbial mats  and as fossilized bubbles within pristine mat laminae can be used as a proxy for oxygenic phototrophy  this provides a strong indication for cyanobacterial activity in the Aravalli mounds. We suggest that the activity of oxygenic phototrophs may have been significant for the formation of apatite in both Vindhyan and Aravalli stromatolites  mainly by concentrating phosphate and creating steep diurnal redox gradients within mat pore spaces  promoting apatite precipitation. The presence in the Indian stromatolites of alternating apatite-carbonate lamina may result from local variations in pH and oxygen levels caused by photosynthesis–respiration in the mats. Altogether  this study presents new insights into the ecology of ancient phosphatic stromatolites and warrants further exploration into the role of oxygen-producing biotas in the formation of Paleoproterozoic shallow-basin phosphorites."

        "text": "Bone daggers were once widespread in New Guinea. Their purpose was both symbolic and utilitarian; they functioned as objects of artistic expression with the primary function of stabbing and killing people at close quarters. Most daggers were shaped from the tibiotarsus of cassowaries  but daggers shaped from the femora of respected men carried greater social prestige. The greater cross-sectional curvature of human bone daggers indicates superior strength  but the material properties of cassowary bone are unknown. It is  therefore  uncertain whether the macrostructure of human bone daggers exists to compensate for inferior material properties of human femora or to preserve the symbolic value of a prestigious object. To explore this question  we used computed tomography to examine the structural mechanics of 11 bone daggers  10 of which are museum-accessioned objects of art. We found that human and cassowary bones have similar material properties and that the geometry of human bone daggers results in higher moments of inertia and a greater resistance to bending. Data from finite-element models corroborated the superior mechanical performance of human bone daggers  revealing greater resistance to larger loads with fewer failed elements. Taken together  our findings suggest that human bone daggers were engineered to preserve symbolic capital  an outcome that agrees well with the predictions of signalling theory."

We reproduce this structure through a series of regional-scale magmatic-thermomechanical forward models which assume that magmatic dikes stall at rheologic discontinuities in the crust. We find that basaltic magmas accumulate at the Moho and at the brittle-ductile transition  which naturally forms at depths of 5–10 km. This leads to the development of a 10- to 15-km thick midcrustal sill complex with a top at a depth of approximately 10 km  consistent with geophysical observations of the pre-Yellowstone hot spot track. We show a linear relationship between melting rates in the mantle and rhyolite eruption rates along the hot spot track. Finally  melt production rates from our models suggest that the Yellowstone plume is ~175°C hotter than the surrounding mantle and that the thickness of the overlying lithosphere is ~80 km."

        "text": "Climate warming threatens to increase mass coral bleaching events  and several studies have projected the demise of tropical coral reefs this century. However  recent evidence indicates corals may be able to respond to thermal stress though adaptive processes (e.g.  genetic adaptation  acclimatization  and symbiont shuffling). How these mechanisms might influence warming-induced bleaching remains largely unknown. This study compared how different adaptive processes could affect coral bleaching projections. We used the latest bias-corrected global sea surface temperature (SST) output from the NOAA/GFDL Earth System Model 2 (ESM2M) for the preindustrial period through 2100 to project coral bleaching trajectories. Initial results showed that  in the absence of adaptive processes  application of a preindustrial climatology to the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method overpredicts the present-day bleaching frequency. This suggests that corals may have already responded adaptively to some warming over the industrial period. We then modified the prediction method so that the bleaching threshold either permanently increased in response to thermal history (e.g.  simulating directional genetic selection) or temporarily increased for 2–10 years in response to a bleaching event (e.g.  simulating symbiont shuffling). A bleaching threshold that changes relative to the preceding 60 years of thermal history reduced the frequency of mass bleaching events by 20–80% compared with the ‘no adaptive response’ prediction model by 2100  depending on the emissions scenario. When both types of adaptive responses were applied  up to 14% more reef cells avoided high-frequency bleaching by 2100. However  temporary increases in bleaching thresholds alone only delayed the occurrence of high-frequency bleaching by ca. 10 years in all but the lowest emissions scenario. Future research should test the rate and limit of different adaptive responses for coral species across latitudes and ocean basins to determine if and how much corals can respond to increasing thermal stress."

While plastics such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are highly versatile  their resistance to natural degradation presents a serious  growing risk to fauna and flora  particularly in marine environments. Here  we have characterized the 3D structure of a newly discovered enzyme that can digest highly crystalline PET  the primary material used in the manufacture of single-use plastic beverage bottles  in some clothing  and in carpets. We engineer this enzyme for improved PET degradation capacity and further demonstrate that it can also degrade an important PET replacement  polyethylene-2 5-furandicarboxylate  providing new opportunities for biobased plastics recycling. Abstract: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced synthetic polymers and is accumulating in the environment at a staggering rate as discarded packaging and textiles. The properties that make PET so useful also endow it with an alarming resistance to biodegradation  likely lasting centuries in the environment. Our collective reliance on PET and other plastics means that this buildup will continue unless solutions are found. Recently  a newly discovered bacterium  Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6  was shown to exhibit the rare ability to grow on PET as a major carbon and energy source. Central to its PET biodegradation capability is a secreted PETase (PET-digesting enzyme). Here  we present a 0.92 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of PETase  which reveals features common to both cutinases and lipases. PETase retains the ancestral α/β-hydrolase fold but exhibits a more open active-site cleft than homologous cutinases. By narrowing the binding cleft via mutation of two active-site residues to conserved amino acids in cutinases  we surprisingly observe improved PET degradation  suggesting that PETase is not fully optimized for crystalline PET degradation  despite presumably evolving in a PET-rich environment. Additionally  we show that PETase degrades another semiaromatic polyester  polyethylene-2 5-furandicarboxylate (PEF)  which is an emerging  bioderived PET replacement with improved barrier properties. In contrast  PETase does not degrade aliphatic polyesters  suggesting that it is generally an aromatic polyesterase. These findings suggest that additional protein engineering to increase PETase performance is realistic and highlight the need for further developments of structure/activity relationships for biodegradation of synthetic polyesters."

However  it remains unclear why and how natural gas hydrates are formed in clay-rich sediments in spite of factors that limit gas hydrate formation  such as small pore size and high salinity. Herein  we show that polarized water molecules on clay surfaces clearly promote gas hydrate nucleation kinetics. When water molecules were polarized with an electric field of 104 V/m  gas hydrate nucleation occurred significantly faster with an induction time reduced by 5.8 times. Further  the presence of strongly polarized water layers at the water–gas interface hindered gas uptake and thus hydrate formation  when the electric field was applied prior to gas dissolution. Our findings expand our understanding of the formation habits of naturally occurring gas hydrates in clay-rich sedimentary deposits and provide insights into gas production from natural hydrate deposits."

These surfaces may be self-cleaning  corrosion-resistant  heat-transfer enhancing  stain-resistant or resistant to mineral- or biofouling. The majority of reported omniphobic surfaces use texture  lubricants  and/or grafted monolayers to engender these repellent properties. Unfortunately  these approaches often produce surfaces with deficiencies in long-term stability  durability  scalability  or applicability to a wide range of substrates. To overcome these limitations  we have fabricated an all-solid  substrate-independent  smooth  omniphobic coating composed of a fluorinated polyurethane and fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane. Liquids of varying surface tension  including water  hexadecane  ethanol  and silicone oil  exhibit low-contact-angle hysteresis (<15°) on these surfaces  allowing liquid droplets to slide off  leaving no residue. Moreover  we demonstrate that these robust surfaces retained their repellent properties more effectively than textured or lubricated omniphobic surfaces after being subjected to mechanical abrasion."

Using data from an array of instruments that span the Atlantic at 26°N  we show that the AMOC has been in a state of reduced overturning since 2008 as compared to 2004–2008. This change of AMOC state is concurrent with other changes in the North Atlantic such as a northward shift and broadening of the Gulf Stream and altered patterns of heat content and sea surface temperature. These changes resemble the response to a declining AMOC predicted by coupled climate models. Concurrent changes in air-sea fluxes close to the western boundary reveal that the changes in ocean heat transport and sea surface temperature have altered the pattern of ocean-atmosphere heat exchange over the North Atlantic. These results provide strong observational evidence that the AMOC is a major factor in decadal-scale variability of North Atlantic climate."

A team of researchers led by Rafaela Takeshita of Kyoto University in Japan have now published the first study to scientifically validate the benefits of this behaviour. These findings indicate how behavioural flexibility can help counter cold-climate stress and have likely implications for reproduction and survival. The study is available in Primates  the official journal of the Japan Monkey Centre  which is published by Springer. Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) are the most northerly species of nonhuman primates in the world  and have adapted to extremely cold winters. Researchers believed that those living in the Jigokudani Monkey Park in Nagano maintain their normal body temperature due to having thicker and longer fur during winter. These primates are also the only group of monkeys known to take hot spring baths  a behaviour that was first observed in 1963 when a young female was seen in an outdoor hot spring belonging to a nearby hotel one snowy day. Other monkeys soon copied this behaviour  and for hygienic purposes  the park management has since built a hot spring for the exclusive use of the monkeys. By 2003  one in every three females in the group bathed regularly in winter. Although the fact that snow monkeys bathe more often during winter suggests that they use the hot spring to stay warm  to date no physiological data had been collected to support this idea. Takeshita and her colleagues studied twelve adult females during the spring birth season  from April to June  and winter mating season  from October to December. They determined how much time the monkeys spent in the hot springs  and which monkeys bathed the most. The researchers also collected faecal samples during times of extreme cold and analysed the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid (fGC) metabolite present. This was done because thermoregulatory stress and the management of a body temperature is known to influence concentrations of glucocorticoids  which belong to the family of steroid hormones. The results confirmed that female snow monkeys use the hot spring more often in winter than in spring  and especially during colder weeks. Dominant females benefited from their status and spent longer time bathing  but they were also involved in more aggressive conflicts  resulting in higher energy expenditure than subordinate females. But taking a spa reduced stress hormone levels in those females. So high social status in this group of snow monkeys has a trade-off between the costs of high rank position and the benefits from a hot spring  which is advantageous for conserving energy by reducing loss of body heat  and lowering stress levels."

Nonetheless  considering that stick insects are slow moving and often flightless  with a limited capacity for dispersal (Bedford 1978)  the benefits of long-distance dispersal via bird predation should not be underestimated. . In addition  while avian predators would not play a significant role in helping the dispersed offspring locate host plants  the females of most stick insect species remain in the foliage and drop eggs from their ovipositor to the ground (Bedford 1978). Therefore  the situation will not differ greatly from the more typical dispersal  whereby young nymphs are also required to independently locate appropriate food plants after hatching."

Siliceous sinters would also be an excellent target  but their presence on Mars awaits confirmation.

Here  we propose that the nitrogen atoms in the N 2 observed on Pluto were accreted in that chemical form during the formation of Pluto. We use New Horizons data and models to estimate the amounts of N 2 in the following exterior reservoirs: atmosphere  escape  photochemistry  and surface. The total exterior inventory is deduced to be dominated by a glacial sheet of N 2-rich ices at Sputnik Planitia  or by atmospheric escape if past rates of escape were much faster than at present. Pluto’s atmosphere is a negligible reservoir of N2  and photochemical destruction of N2 may also be of little consequence. Estimates are made of the amount of N2 accreted by Pluto based on cometary and solar compositions. It is found that the cometary model can account for the amount of N2 in Sputnik Planitia  while the solar model can provide a large initial inventory of N2 that would make prodigious atmospheric escape possible. These consistencies can be considered preliminary evidence in support of a primordial origin of Pluto’s N2. However  both models predict accreted ratios of CO/N2 that are much higher than that in Pluto’s atmosphere. Possible processes to explain “missing CO” that are given quantitative support here are fractional crystallization from the atmosphere resulting in CO burial at the surface  and aqueous destruction reactions of CO subject to metastable thermodynamic equilibrium in the subsurface. The plausibility of primordial N2 as the primary source of Pluto’s nitrogen (vs. NH3 or organic N) can be tested more rigorously using future constraints on the 14N/15N ratio in N2 and the 36Ar/N2 ratio."

We assemble a census of the biomass of all kingdoms of life. This analysis provides a holistic view of the composition of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories  geographic locations  and trophic modes. Abstract: A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However  a global  quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here  we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere  establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C  the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial  whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine  and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota  doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers  thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally  we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa  including mammals  fish  and plants."

Using a preregistered plan for analyzing data collected from a representative sample of English adolescents (n = 120 115)  we obtained evidence that the links between digital-screen time and mental well-being are described by quadratic functions. Further  our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i.e.  weekday vs. weekend)  suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall  the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world.

However  the age range of valid theoretical orbital solutions is limited to only the past 50 million years. New U–Pb zircon dates from the Chinle Formation tied using magnetostratigraphy to the Newark–Hartford astrochronostratigraphic polarity timescale provide empirical confirmation that the unimodal 405-kiloyear orbital eccentricity cycle reliably paces Earth’s climate back to at least 215 million years ago  well back in the Late Triassic Period. Abstract: The Newark–Hartford astrochronostratigraphic polarity timescale (APTS) was developed using a theoretically constant 405-kiloyear eccentricity cycle linked to gravitational interactions with Jupiter–Venus as a tuning target and provides a major timing calibration for about 30 million years of Late Triassic and earliest Jurassic time. While the 405-ky cycle is both unimodal and the most metronomic of the major orbital cycles thought to pace Earth’s climate in numerical solutions  there has been little empirical confirmation of that behavior  especially back before the limits of orbital solutions at about 50 million years before present. Moreover  the APTS is anchored only at its younger end by U–Pb zircon dates at 201.6 million years before present and could even be missing a number of 405-ky cycles. To test the validity of the dangling APTS and orbital periodicities  we recovered a diagnostic magnetic polarity sequence in the volcaniclastic-bearing Chinle Formation in a scientific drill core from Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona) that provides an unambiguous correlation to the APTS. New high precision U–Pb detrital zircon dates from the core are indistinguishable from ages predicted by the APTS back to 215 million years before present. The agreement shows that the APTS is continuous and supports a stable 405-kiloyear cycle well beyond theoretical solutions. The validated Newark–Hartford APTS can be used as a robust framework to help differentiate provinciality from global temporal patterns in the ecological rise of early dinosaurs in the Late Triassic  amongst other problems."

Interventions Investigators randomly selected 40 episodes of each of The Dr Oz Show and The Doctors from early 2013 and identified and evaluated all recommendations made on each program. A group of experienced evidence reviewers independently searched for  and evaluated as a team  evidence to support 80 randomly selected recommendations from each show. Main outcomes measures Percentage of recommendations that are supported by evidence as determined by a team of experienced evidence reviewers. Secondary outcomes included topics discussed  the number of recommendations made on the shows  and the types and details of recommendations that were made. Results We could find at least a case study or better evidence to support 54% (95% confidence interval 47% to 62%) of the 160 recommendations (80 from each show). For recommendations in The Dr Oz Show  evidence supported 46%  contradicted 15%  and was not found for 39%. For recommendations in The Doctors  evidence supported 63%  contradicted 14%  and was not found for 24%. Believable or somewhat believable evidence supported 33% of the recommendations on The Dr Oz Show and 53% on The Doctors. On average  The Dr Oz Show had 12 recommendations per episode and The Doctors 11. The most common recommendation category on The Dr Oz Show was dietary advice (39%) and on The Doctors was to consult a healthcare provider (18%). A specific benefit was described for 43% and 41% of the recommendations made on the shows respectively. The magnitude of benefit was described for 17% of the recommendations on The Dr Oz Show and 11% on The Doctors. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest accompanied 0.4% of recommendations. Conclusions Recommendations made on medical talk shows often lack adequate information on specific benefits or the magnitude of the effects of these benefits. Approximately half of the recommendations have either no evidence or are contradicted by the best available evidence. Potential conflicts of interest are rarely addressed. The public should be skeptical about recommendations made on medical talk shows."

INSL3 treatment stimulated cell proliferation of embryonic gubernacular and Leydig cells  implicating active INSL3-mediated signaling. The transcription factor SOX9  a known male sex determination factor  upregulated the activity of the RXFP2 promoter. INSL3 is sufficient to direct the first transabdominal phase of testicular descent in the absence of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis signaling or Hoxa10  although these factors are important for inguinoscrotal testicular descent. Similarly  conditional ablation of the androgen receptor gene in gubernacular cells resulted in disruption of inguinoscrotal descent.

Several missense mutations were described in both the INSL3 and RXFP2 genes.

The lowest temperatures are found in small (<200 km2) topographic basins of ~2 m depth above 3 800 m elevation. Approximately 100 sites have observed minimum surface temperatures of ~−98 °C during the winters of 2004–2016. Comparisons of surface snow temperatures with near-surface air temperatures at nearby weather stations indicate that ~−98 °C surfaces imply ~−94 ± 4 °C 2-m air temperatures. Landsat 8 thermal band data and elevation data show gradients near the topographic depressions of ~6 °C km−1 horizontally and ~4 °C m−1 vertically. Ultralow temperature occurrences correlate with strong polar vortex circulation. We discuss a conceptual model of radiative surface cooling that produces an extreme inversion layer. Further cooling occurs as near-surface cold air pools in shallow high-elevation topographic basins  moderated by clear-air downwelling radiation and heat from subsurface snow."

The discrepancy may owe to deep (>10-km depth)  creep along the nearby northern San Jacinto fault. The enigmatic normal slip microseismicity occurs to the northeast of the fault and primarily below 10-km depth  consistent with off-fault deformation due to spatially nonuniform ongoing slip. Consequently  if these normal focal mechanisms are included in stress inversions from the seismic catalog  the results may provide inaccurate information about fault loading. Here we show that off-fault loading from models with deep interseismic creep on the northern San Jacinto fault match the first-order pattern of observed normal slip focal mechanisms in the basin and that this deep creep cannot be detected with GPS data due to the proximity of the San Andreas fault."

Atmospheric water harvesting is emerging as a promising strategy for clean water production in arid regions  land-locked areas  and remote communities. The water vapor sorbent is the key component for atmospheric water harvesting devices based on absorbing-releasing process. In this work  a flexible hybrid photothermal water sorbent composed of deliquescent salt and hydrogel was rationally fabricated. It possesses superior water sorption capacity even in low humidity air thanks to the deliquescent salt and maintains a solid form after it sorbs a large amount of water owing to the hydrogel platform. The harvested water could be easily released under regular sunlight via the photothermal effect  and it can be directly reused without noticeable capacity fading. An “easy-to-assemble-at-household” prototype device with 35 g of the dry hydrogel was tested outdoors under field conditions and delivered 20 g of fresh water within 2.5 h under natural sunlight. It is estimated that the material cost of making such a device to supply minimum daily water consumption for an adult (i.e.  3 kg) is only $3.20 (USD). This type of atmospheric water generator (AWG) is cheap and affordable  works perfectly with a broad range of humidity  does not need any electricity  and thus is especially suitable for clean water production in remote areas."

Closed cycle systems for storage of solar energy have been suggested  based on absorption of photons in photoresponsive molecules  followed by on-demand release of thermal energy. These materials are called solar thermal fuels (STFs) or molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage systems. To achieve high energy densities  ideal MOST systems are required either in solid or liquid forms. In the case of the latter  neat high performing liquid materials have not been demonstrated to date. Here is presented a set of neat liquid norbornadiene derivatives for MOST applications and their characterization in toluene solutions and neat samples. Their synthesis is in most cases based on solvent-free Diels-Alder reactions  which easily and efficiently afford a range of compounds. The shear viscosity of the obtained molecules is close to that of colza oil  and they can absorb up to 10% of the solar spectrum with a measured energy storage density of up to 577 kJ/kg corresponding to 152 kJ mol–1 (calculated 100 kJ mol–1). These findings pave the way towards implementation of liquid norbornadienes in closed cycle energy storage technologies."

The quadricyclane isomers with substituents in the ortho-position exhibited exceptionally high thermal stability without compromising the other properties. Calculations show a greatly enhanced barrier of rotation in the quadricyclane form coming about from this steric congestion interfering with the transition state. Abstract: Norbornadiene-quadricyclane (NBD-QC) photoswitches are candidates for applications in solar thermal energy storage. Functionally  they rely on an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction  which couples the S0 landscape on the NBD side to the S1 landscape on the QC side of the reaction and vice-versa. This commonly results in an unfavourable correlation between the first absorption maximum and the barrier for thermal back-conversion. This work demonstrates that this correlation can be counteracted by using steric repulsion to hamper the rotational motion of the side groups along the back-conversion path. It is shown that this modification reduces the correlation between the effective back-conversion barrier and the first absorption maximum and also increases the back-conversion entropy. The resulting molecules exhibit exceptionally long half-lives for their metastable forms without significantly affecting other properties  most notably solar spectrum match and storage density."

After removing the effect of meteorological variability  we find that surface ozone has increased in megacity clusters of China  notably Beijing and Shanghai. The increasing trend cannot be simply explained by changes in anthropogenic precursor [NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC)] emissions  particularly in North China Plain (NCP). The most important cause of the increasing ozone in NCP appears to be the decrease in PM2.5  slowing down the sink of hydroperoxy radicals and thus speeding up ozone production. Decreasing ozone in the future will require a combination of NOx and VOC emission controls to overcome the effect of decreasing PM2.5. Abstract Observations of surface ozone available from ∼1 000 sites across China for the past 5 years (2013–2017) show severe summertime pollution and regionally variable trends. We resolve the effect of meteorological variability on the ozone trends by using a multiple linear regression model. The residual of this regression shows increasing ozone trends of 1–3 ppbv a−1 in megacity clusters of eastern China that we attribute to changes in anthropogenic emissions. By contrast  ozone decreased in some areas of southern China. Anthropogenic NOx emissions in China are estimated to have decreased by 21% during 2013–2017  whereas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions changed little. Decreasing NOx would increase ozone under the VOC-limited conditions thought to prevail in urban China while decreasing ozone under rural NOx-limited conditions. However  simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemical Transport Model (GEOS-Chem) indicate that a more important factor for ozone trends in the North China Plain is the ∼40% decrease of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the 2013–2017 period  slowing down the aerosol sink of hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals and thus stimulating ozone production."

The use of a hydrogen absorption cell allowed to disentangle the interplanetary emission from the geocoronal one and to assign the absorbed signal almost entirely to the geocorona. The geocorona was found to extend at least up to 100 Earth radii (RE) with an intensity of 5 Rayleigh  an unprecedented distance well exceeding the recent results of Lyman Alpha Imaging Camera (LAICA) imager (∼50 RE)  and encompassing the orbit of the Moon (∼60 RE). We developed a numerical kinetic model of the hydrogen atoms distribution in the exosphere  which includes the solar Lyman-α radiation pressure and the ionization. The radiation pressure compresses the H exosphere on the dayside  producing a bulge of H density between 3 and 20 RE  which fits observed intensities very well. The SWAN Lyman-α distribution of intensity was compared both to LAICA (2015) and to Orbiting Geophysical Observatory number 5 (1968) measurements. Integrated H densities of SWAN at a tangent distance of 7 RE are larger than LAICA/Orbiting Geophysical Observatory number 5 by factors 1.1–2.5  while we should expect a stronger effect of the radiation pressure at solar max. We discuss the possible role of H atoms in satellite orbits to explain this apparent contradiction. An onion-peeling technique is used to retrieve hydrogen number density in the exosphere for the three SWAN observations. They show an excess of density versus models at large distances  which is likely due to nonthermal atoms (not in the model)."

Both require temporal scaling and extrapolation for comparison on the same time scale. PETM rates are few and projection to a short time scale is poorly constrained. Modern rates are many  and projection to a longer PETM time scale is tightly constrained—modern rates are some 9–10 times higher than those during onset of the PETM.

In this study  model PP was converted into oil using supercritical water at 380–500 °C and 23 MPa over a reaction time of 0.5–6 h. Up to 91 wt % of model PP was converted into oil at 425 °C with a 2–4 h reaction time or at 450 °C with a 0.5–1 h reaction time. Higher reaction temperatures (>450 °C) or longer reaction times (>4 h) led to more gas products. The oil products consisted of olefins  paraffins  cyclics  and aromatics. About 80–90 wt % of the oil components had the same boiling point range as naphtha (25–200 °C) and heating values of 48–49 MJ/kg. Reaction pathways for converting model PP into oil under the tested conditions were proposed. Preliminary analyses indicate that this conversion process is net-energy positive and potentially has a higher energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions than incineration and mechanical recycling. The oil derived from PP has the potential to be used as gasoline blendstocks or feedstocks for other chemicals."

Although buried by 2 km of ice  the structure's rim induces a conspicuously circular surface expression  it possesses a central uplift  and it causes a negative gravity anomaly. The existence of two closely spaced and similarly sized complex craters raises the possibility that they formed during related impact events.

        "text": "November 10  2015 - In 1655 the English mathematician John Wallis published a book in which he derived a formula for pi as the product of an infinite series of ratios. Now researchers from the University of Rochester  in a surprise discovery  have found the same formula in quantum mechanical calculations of the energy levels of a hydrogen atom. \"We weren't looking for the Wallis formula for pi. It just fell into our laps  said Carl Hagen, a particle physicist at the University of Rochester. Having noticed an intriguing trend in the solutions to a problem set he had developed for students in a class on quantum mechanics, Hagen recruited mathematician Tamar Friedmann and they realized this trend was in fact a manifestation of the Wallis formula for pi. It was a complete surprise - I jumped up and down when we got the Wallis formula out of equations for the hydrogen atom  said Friedmann. The special thing is that it brings out a beautiful connection between physics and math. I find it fascinating that a purely mathematical formula from the 17th century characterizes a physical system that was discovered 300 years later.\" The researchers report their findings in the Journal of Mathematical Physics  from AIP Publishing. In quantum mechanics  a technique called the variational approach can be used to approximate the energy states of quantum systems  like molecules  that can't be solved exactly. Hagen was teaching the technique to his students when he decided to apply it to a real-world object: the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom is actually one of the rare quantum mechanical systems whose energy levels can be solved exactly  but by applying the variational approach and then comparing the result to the exact solution  students could calculate the error in the approximation. When Hagen started solving the problem himself  he immediately noticed a trend. The error of the variational approach was about 15 percent for the ground state of hydrogen  10 percent for the first excited state  and kept getting smaller as the excited states grew larger. This was unusual  since the variational approach normally only gives good approximations for the lowest energy levels. Hagen recruited Friedmann to take a look at what would happen with increasing energy. They found that the limit of the variational solution approaches the model of hydrogen developed by physicist Niels Bohr in the early 20th century  which depicts the orbits of the electron as perfectly circular. This would be expected from Bohr's correspondence principle  which states that for large radius orbits  the behavior of quantum systems can be described by classical physics. \"At the lower energy orbits  the path of the electron is fuzzy and spread out  Hagen explained. At more excited states  the orbits become more sharply defined and the uncertainty in the radius decreases.\" From the formula for the limit of the variational solution as the energy increased  Hagen and Friedmann were able to pull out the Wallis formula for pi. The theory of quantum mechanics dates back to the early 20th century and the Wallis formula has been around for hundreds of years  but the connection between the two had remained hidden until now. \"Nature had kept this secret for the last 80 years  Friedmann said. I'm glad we revealed it.\""

While several mathematical proofs of this formula have been put forth in the past (many just in the last decade) using probability [3]  combinatorics and probability [4]  geometric means [5]  trigonometry [6  7]  and trigonometric integrals [8]  there has not been in the literature a derivation of Eq.

Next  I highlight the Anthropocene’s dominant periodization  which meets up with a longstanding environmentalist argument about the Industrial Revolution as the origin of ecological crisis.

Participants recalled a recent time when they experienced three different anger-provoking events when driving.

Participants also completed a battery of personality questionnaires designed to predict their responses to the situations. Attributing causality for the anger-arousing event to a stable factor in the offending driver was uniquely related to aggressive behaviour and anger in all three situations. Hostile and blame attributions predicted aggressive behaviour and anger in different situations. In addition to dispositional measures of aggressiveness and anger predicting aggressive behaviour and anger in each of the anger-provoking situations  other personality variables were also related to aspects of the road rage response (e.g. conscientiousness  agreeableness  narcissism  and extraversion). Attributions and personality traits accounted for unique variance in the outcomes  and there were only sporadic effects of attributions partially mediating the relationships between personality variables and responses to the anger-provoking situations. Therefore  it is unlikely that the relationships between personality traits and responses to anger-provoking situations are completely mediated by attributional processing."

A new article introduces a microwave-driven APPJ (MAPPJ) design that can overcome these limitations and offer advantages in biomedical applications. APPJs typically use a quartz tube to stabilize their gas flow  which confines the majority of the plasma jet within the tube  making it difficult to use in applications where the plasma needs to interact with an outside object. To address this  Fu et al. developed an MAPPJ based on a complex coaxial transmission design  with one gas channel through the outer transmission line acting as the quartz tube that restricts the plasma  and a separate gas channel through the inner transmission line where the plasma is. The flow for each transmission line can then be adjusted via the driving microwave source to control the length  width and temperature of the plasma jet. As a result  the jet is entirely exposed and can interact with outside objects. The researchers used a custom-designed microwave source and a complex transmission line structure where the inner conductor of the outer line also acts as the outer conductor of the inner line. This method makes it possible to operate at low temperature and high atmospheric pressure with high efficiency with little thermal radiation. The ability to touch object surfaces  such as human skin  creates new possibilities for biomedical applications. “With the development of low-temperature plasma jets  the applications of plasmas used in biomedical fields would be extended for use not only as a surgery knife  but also for skin treating  sterilization  and cancer therapy ” said author Wenjie Fu."

Moving to the properties of dense hydrogen has appeared a good deal more complex than originally thought by Wigner and Hungtinton in their seminal paper predicting metal hydrogen2): the electrons and the protons are strongly coupled to each other and ultimately must be treated equally3) 4). The determination of how and when molecular solid hydrogen will transform into a metal is the stepping stone towards a full understanding of ththe quantum-many body properties of dense hydrogen. The quest for metal hydrogen has pushed major developments of modern experimental high pressure physics  yet the various claims of its observation over the past 30 years have remained controversial. Here we show a first order phase transition near 425 GPa from insulator molecular solid hydrogen to metal hydrogen. Pressure in excess of 400 GPa could be achieved by using the recently developed Toroidal Diamond Anvil Cell (TDAC)8) . The structural and electronic properties of dense solid hydrogen at 80 K have been characterized by synchrotron infrared spectroscopy. The continuous vibron frequency shift and the electronic band gap closure down to 0.5 eV  both linearly evolving with pressure  point to the stability of the insulator C2/c-24 phase up to the metallic transition. Upon pressure release  the metallic state transforms back to the C2/c-24 phase with almost no hysteresis  hence suggesting that the metallization proceeds through a structural transformation within the molecular solid  presumably to the Cmca-12 structure. Our results are in good agreement with the scenario recently disclosed by an advanced calculation able to capture many-body electronic correlations). "

Photochemistry in the upper atmosphere generates a complex array of organic molecules from the simple precursors N2 and CH4. These organics continue to react and combine  forming aerosol layers and ultimately depositing on the surface. Organics are transported via pluvial (rain) and fluvial (rivers/flooding) processes into the methane-based hydrocarbon lakes  where evaporation of volatile liquids can create evaporite deposits of remnant dissolved molecules. Within such deposits  chemical and physical processes may be occurring even at low temperatures. We have demonstrated in previous work that benzene and ethane rapidly form a unique and stable co-crystal at Titan surface temperatures (90–95 K)  akin to a salt on Earth  where the weak van der Waals interactions in the benzene-ethane co-crystal are analogous to the ionic bonds in a salt. Here  we report the formation of a second co-crystal between acetylene and ammonia  which forms even more quickly and is stable through anticipated conditions of Titan “rain” events of liquid methane  ethane  and propane. Such co-crystals represent an exciting new class of possible minerals for Titan’s surface and may be responsible for processes such as selective sequestration and storage of species as well as having new properties for construction and erosive resistance of geological materials."

Bottom-up synthetic biology aims to re-create cellular organization and function through the creation of “artificial cells” (ACs) through molecular self-assembly. Although the construction of new signaling pathways will enable increasingly responsive ACs  this area is undeveloped; here  we show that multicompartment lipid vesicles are an ideal framework to build a pathway not found in nature. External calcium ions activate internal protein communication  leading to control of cell fluorescence. This highlights the potential of ACs for design and construction of synthetic pathways difficult to reconstitute in existing cells  leading to development of environment-responsive molecular machines in biotechnology. Abstract: To date  reconstitution of one of the fundamental methods of cell communication  the signaling pathway  has been unaddressed in the bottom-up construction of artificial cells (ACs). Such developments are needed to increase the functionality and biomimicry of ACs  accelerating their translation and application in biotechnology. Here  we report the construction of a de novo synthetic signaling pathway in microscale nested vesicles. Vesicle-cell models respond to external calcium signals through activation of an intracellular interaction between phospholipase A2 and a mechanosensitive channel present in the internal membranes  triggering content mixing between compartments and controlling cell fluorescence. Emulsion-based approaches to AC construction are therefore shown to be ideal for the quick design and testing of new signaling networks and can readily include synthetic molecules difficult to introduce to biological cells. This work represents a foundation for the engineering of multicompartment-spanning designer pathways that can be utilized to control downstream events inside an AC  leading to the assembly of micromachines capable of sensing and responding to changes in their local environment."

Because of their nearly infinite PDOS  refractory hyperbolic materials make a promising material platform for thermal emitters. However  it is challenging to achieve a prominent PDOS in existing refractory hyperbolic materials  especially in a broad bandwidth. Here  we demonstrate macroscopically aligned carbon nanotubes as an excellent refractory material platform for hyperbolic nanophotonic devices. Aligned carbon nanotubes are thermally stable up to 1600 °C and exhibit extreme anisotropy: metallic in one direction and insulating in the other two directions. Such extreme anisotropy results in an exceptionally large PDOS over a broadband spectrum range (longer than 4.3 μm) in the mid-infrared  manifesting as strong resonances in deeply subwavelength-sized cavities. We demonstrate polarized  spectrally selective  thermal emission from aligned carbon nanotube films and indefinite cavities of volume as small as ∼λ3/700 operating at 700 °C.

A microbiological approach can make the graphene production process more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Microbially-produced graphene demonstrates increased conductance and a high surface-area-to-thickness ratio  making it well-suited to a number of different applications. Abstract: Graphene's maximized surface-to-volume ratio  high conductance  mechanical strength  and flexibility make it a promising nanomaterial. However  large-scale graphene production is typically cost-intensive. This manuscript describes a microbial reduction approach for producing graphene that utilizes the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis in combination with modern nanotechnology to enable a low-cost  large-scale production method. The bacterial reduction approach presented in this paper increases the conductance of single graphene oxide flakes as well as bulk graphene oxide sheets by 2.1 to 2.7 orders of magnitude respectively while simultaneously retaining a high surface-area-to-thickness ratio. Shewanella-mediated reduction was employed in conjunction with electron-beam lithography to reduce one surface of individual graphene oxide flakes. This methodology yielded conducting flakes with differing functionalization on the top and bottom faces. Therefore  microbial reduction of graphene oxide enables the development and up-scaling of new types of graphene-based materials and devices with a variety of applications including nano-composites  conductive inks  and biosensors  while avoiding usage of hazardous  environmentally-unfriendly chemicals."

A second pattern  ‘mass anxiety hysteria’ (n = 62)  is typified by the sudden appearance of extreme anxiety following the redefinition of a mundane event such as illness in a fellow student or an unfamiliar odour  which is perceived as an immediate threat. A third pattern  ‘mass pseudo‐hysteria’ (n = 1) involves the relabelling of mundane symptoms by hypervigilant authorities. Epidemic hysteria in school settings manifests as variants of a unitary syndrome that is masked by cultural custom and local nomenclature. A diagnosis is reached by noting the absence of a concrete pathogenic etiology  in conjunction with group anxiety  ambiguous  benign  transient symptomatology  and a preponderance of female victims. Management consists of the identification and removal of the precipitating psychosocial stress."

This is done by studying a model chaotic dynamical system with a single free parameter β  known as the generalized Bernoulli map  many of whose exact properties are known. Much of the structure of the dynamical system is lost in the floating-point representation. For even integer values of the parameter  the long time behaviour is completely wrong  subsuming the known anomalous behaviour for β = 2. For non-integer β  relative errors in observables can reach 14%. For odd integer values of β  floating-point results are more accurate  but still produce relative errors two orders of magnitude larger than those attributable to roundoff. The analysis indicates that the pathology described  which cannot be mitigated by increasing the precision of the floating point numbers  is a representative example of a deeper problem in the computation of expectation values for chaotic systems. The findings sound a warning about the uncritical application of numerical methods in studies of the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems  such as are routinely performed throughout computational science  including turbulence and molecular dynamics."

The relevance of this approach is based on the following arguments: • Neutrinos are not massless as we have convincing evidence for neutrino oscillations from experiments detecting atmospheric and solar neutrinos. The signals are interpreted as differences in the squares of neutrino masses from which a lower bound for the neutrino masses can be derived. • As these differences are rather small one can set limits for all neutrino masses from the lowest upper bound which is set by the Mainz group from tritium β decay:  m_v^2 = -1.6 ± 2.5 ± eV^ 2.1 /c^4 corresponding to an upper limit of mv < 2.2 eV/c2 (95 % C.L.). Hence the sum of the three neutrino masses is less than about 7 eV/c2 The results are of interest for cosmology as neutrinos are part of the hot dark matter. The minimum total mass deduced from oscilation experiments is about equal to the sum of the stellar masses. The present upper bound from the direct mass measurements is about equal to the limit given by structure formation. The result of the two presently working experiments in Mainz and Troitsk and their systematic uncertainties will be presented. These experiment have almost reached their sensitivity limits. A next generation experiment KATRIN will be set up at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. Its aim is to push the sensitivity limit to mv < 0.3 eV/c2 (90 % C.L.).

With conventional technology  however  this requires a machine that is enormously big and expensive (think 20 miles long). To shrink the size and cost of these machines  the acceleration of the particles--how much energy they gain in a given distance--must be increased. This is where plasma physics could have a dramatic impact: a wave of charged particles--a plasma wave--can provide this acceleration through its electric field. In a laser plasma accelerator  intense laser pulses are used to create a plasma wave with electric fields that can be thousands of times stronger than those attainable in conventional accelerators. Recently  the team at Berkeley Lab's BELLA Center doubled the previous world record for energy produced by laser plasma accelerators  generating electron beams with energies up to 7.8 billion electron volts (GeV) in an 8-inch-long plasma. This would require about 300 feet using conventional technology. The researchers achieved this feat by counteracting the natural spreading of the laser pulse using a new type of plasma waveguide. In this waveguide  an electrical discharge is triggered in a sapphire tube filled with gas to form a plasma  and a \"heater\" laser pulse drills out some of the plasma in the middle  making it less dense so that it focuses the laser light (Figure 1). The plasma channel is strong enough to keep the focused laser pulses well-confined over the 8-inch accelerator length. \"The heater beam allowed us to control the propagation of the driver laser pulse  said Dr. Anthony Gonsalves. The next experiments will aim to gain precision control over electron injection into the plasma wave for achieving unprecedented beam quality  and to couple multiple stages together to demonstrate the path to even higher energy.\""

In this work  we develop numerical simulations of global tectonism with impacting effects  and simulate the evolution of these models throughout the Archaean for given impact fluxes.

Large lithospheric thickness gradients may have first appeared at ca. 3.5–3.2 Ga as cratonic roots  and we postulate an association between Earth’s thermal maturation  cratonic root stability  and the onset of widespread sporadic tectonism driven by the impact flux at this time."

Here  a novel strategy is exhibited to enhance the adhesiveness of hydrogels by introducing positively charged microgel into the hydrogel matrix of polydopamine inspired by the natural mussel adhesive mechanism. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit good adhesion not only on various organic and inorganic surfaces (such as polythene  polytetrafluoroethylene  rubber  ceramics  glass  and copper) but also on many biological tissue surfaces (e.g.  heart  liver  lung  kidney  and hogskin). Compared with hydrogels only containing catechol moieties  the adhesion strength of microgel-containing hydrogels increased 8 times on glass substrates. In addition  the adhesive hydrogel also exhibits rapid self-healing and good stretchability due to the noncovalent interaction between the microgel and the hydrogel matrix. On the whole  doping microgel in the construction of multifunctional hydrogels substantially improved their adhesive ability on many types of surfaces."

While discovering new forms is rare  recently  scientists reported of citizens' observations of STEVE  a pinkish optical manifestation of subauroral ionospheric drifts that were not thought to be visible to the naked eye. Here  we present a new auroral form named “the dunes”. On 7 October 2018  citizen observers took multiple digital photographs of the same dunes simultaneously from different locations in Finland and Sweden. We develop a triangulation method to analyze the photographs and conclude that the dunes are a monochromatic wave field with a wavelength of about 45 km within a thin layer at 100 km altitude. Supporting data suggest that the dunes manifest atmospheric waves  possibly mesospheric bores  which are rarely detected  and have not previously been observed via diffuse aurora nor at auroral latitudes and altitudes. The dunes present a new opportunity to investigate the coupling of the lower/middle atmosphere to the thermosphere and ionosphere. Our paper adds to the growing body of work that illustrates the value of citizen scientist images in carrying out quantitative analysis of optical phenomena  especially at small scales at subauroral latitudes. Further  the dune project presents means to create general interest toward physics  emphasizing that citizens can take part in scientific work by helping to uncover new phenomena."

It would thus be useful to build technologies using self-renewing and biocompatible materials  of which the ideal candidates are living systems themselves. Thus  we here present a method that designs completely biological machines from the ground up: computers automatically design new machines in simulation  and the best designs are then built by combining together different biological tissues. This suggests others may use this approach to design a variety of living machines to safely deliver drugs inside the human body  help with environmental remediation  or further broaden our understanding of the diverse forms and functions life may adopt. Abstract: Living systems are more robust  diverse  complex  and supportive of human life than any technology yet created. However  our ability to create novel lifeforms is currently limited to varying existing organisms or bioengineering organoids in vitro. Here we show a scalable pipeline for creating functional novel lifeforms: AI methods automatically design diverse candidate lifeforms in silico to perform some desired function  and transferable designs are then created using a cell-based construction toolkit to realize living systems with the predicted behaviors. Although some steps in this pipeline still require manual intervention  complete automation in future would pave the way to designing and deploying unique  bespoke living systems for a wide range of functions."

The final apparent density and porosity of the material depend directly on the volumetric concentration of the starting solution used for hydrogel formation. After annealing  a homogeneous microstructure is obtained in which the shining gold single crystal platelets are evenly embedded in a polystyrene matrix. The material has a glass transition temperature of ≈105 °C which allows for annealing and molding above this temperature. A general scaling behavior is found for the Young's modulus of the material with the density. The Young's modulus of the material with a density of 1.7 g cm−3 is ≈50 MPa.

Strong density variations of spatial scales indicative of gravity waves have previously been identified in this region by using in situ observations. Here we use observations from the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) mass spectrometer on Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission to identify such waves in the observations of different atmospheric species. The wave signatures seen in CO2 and Ar are almost identical  whereas the wave signature seen in N2  which is lighter and has a larger scale height  is generally smaller in amplitude and slightly out of phase with those seen in CO2 and Ar. Examination of the observed wave properties in these three species suggests that relatively long vertical wavelength atmospheric gravity waves are the likely source of the waves seen by NGIMS in the upper thermosphere. A two-fluid linear model of the wave perturbations in CO2 and N2 has been used to find the best fit intrinsic wave parameters that match the observed features in these two species. We report the first observationally based estimate of the heating and cooling rates of the Martian thermosphere created by the waves observed in this region. The observed wave density amplitudes are anticorrelated with the background atmospheric temperature. The estimated heating rates show a weak positive correlation with the wave amplitude  whereas the cooling rates show a clearer negative correlation with the wave amplitude. Our estimates support previous model-based findings that atmospheric gravity waves are a significant source of both heating and cooling."

The thermal atomic oxygen corona is derived from a collisionless Chamberlain approach  whereas the nonthermal atomic oxygen corona is derived from Monte Carlo simulations. The two main sources of hot exospheric oxygen atoms at Mars are the dissociative recombination of O2+ between 120 and 300 km and the sputtering of the Martian atmosphere by incident O+ pickup ions. The reimpacting and escaping fluxes of pickup ions are derived from a 3-D hybrid model describing the interaction of the solar wind with our computed Martian oxygen exosphere. In this work it is shown that the role of the sputtering crucially depends on an accurate description of the Martian corona as well as of its interaction with the solar wind. The sputtering contribution to the total oxygen escape is smaller by one order of magnitude than the contribution due to the dissociative recombination. The neutral escape is dominant at both solar activities (1 × 1025 s−1 for low solar activity and 4 × 1025 s−1 for high solar activity)  and the ion escape flux is estimated to be equal to 2 × 1023 s−1 at low solar activity and to 3.4 × 1024 s−1 at high solar activity. This work illustrates one more time the strong dependency of these loss rates on solar conditions. It underlines the difficulty of extrapolating the present measured loss rates to the past solar conditions without a better theoretical and observational knowledge of this dependency."

However  they suffer from significant degradation during the initial stages of use. This problem has been studied for 40 years resulting in over 250 research publications. Despite this  there is no consensus regarding the microscopic nature of the defect reactions responsible. In this paper  we present compelling evidence of the mechanism of degradation. We observe  using deep level transient spectroscopy and photoluminescence  under the action of light or injected carriers  the conversion of a deep boron-di-oxygen-related donor state into a shallow acceptor which correlates with the change in the lifetime of minority carriers in the silicon. Using ab initio modeling  we propose structures of the BsO2 defect which match the experimental findings. We put forward the hypothesis that the dominant recombination process associated with the degradation is trap-assisted Auger recombination. This assignment is supported by the observation of above bandgap luminescence due to hot carriers resulting from the Auger process."

Here  we demonstrate that APT can be successfully used to characterize the composition and texture of space weathering products in ilmenite from Apollo 17 sample 71501 at near-atomic resolution. Two of the studied nanotips sampled the top surface of the space-weathered grain  while another nanotip sampled the ilmenite at about 50 nm below the surface. These nanotips contain small nanophase Fe particles (~3 to 10 nm diameter)  with these particles becoming less frequent with depth. One of the nanotips contains a sequence of space weathering products  compositional zoning  and a void space (~15 nm in diameter) which we interpret as a vesicle generated by solar wind irradiation. No noble gases were detected in this vesicle  although there is evidence for 4He elsewhere in the nanotip.

However  the unusual properties of liquid water  if compared with other liquids  has puzzled us for centuries because the basic structure of liquid water has remained unclear and has continued to be a matter of serious debate. Here  by computer simulations of three popular water models and the analysis of recent scattering experimental data  we show that there are two overlapped peaks hidden in the apparent “first diffraction peak” of the structure factor. One of them (ordinary peak) corresponds to the neighboring O–O distance as in ordinary liquids  and the other (anomalous peak) corresponds to a longer distance. We reveal that this anomalous peak arises from the most extended period of density wave associated with a tetrahedral water structure and is to be identified as the so-called first sharp diffraction peak that is commonly observed in silica and other tetrahedral liquids. In contrast  the ordinary peak arises from the density wave characteristic of local structures lacking tetrahedral symmetry. This finding unambiguously proves the coexistence of two types of local structures in liquid water. Our findings not only provide vital clues to settle a long-standing controversy on the water structure but also allow direct experimental access to the fraction of tetrahedral structures in liquid water."

The results of their work have been published in Nature Communications. In solid-state physics  the notion of ferroelectricity refers to the property of a material whose electric dipole moments  while cooling  align themselves in an ordered pattern. Because the water molecule (H?O) is characterized by a very large dipole moment (approx. 1.9 D  where \"D\" stands for the debye  a unit of electric dipole moment)  one would expect that in liquid water the molecular dipoles should strongly interact with each other and  consequently  align themselves in a certain manner  i.e.  demonstrate ferroelectric behavior. However  in liquid water  such ordering does not occur due to the molecules being located so closely that their interactions are dominated by the short-range hydrogen bonds  which suppress the long-range dipole-dipole forces. The situation changes drastically when water molecules are forced to interact with foreign structures/surfaces or are confined within closed cavities of sufficiently small (nanoscale) dimensions. Under such conditions  the role of hydrogen bonds can be diminished by \"redirecting\" them to these additional interactions  so as to make the interactions between water dipoles come to the fore."

They include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  compulsive spending (including gambling)  overeating (bulimia)  hypersexuality (straight or deviant)  and kleptomania. Common across dependence syndromes is: a repeated urge to engage in behaviour known to be counterproductive; mounting tension until it is completed; rapid temporary switching off of the tension by completing the behaviour; gradual return of the urge; syndrome-specific external and perhaps internal cues for the urge; secondary conditioning of the urge to external and internal cues; similar strategies for relapse prevention by cue exposure and stimulus control. The urge to complete a behaviour and discomfort if prevented from this resemble the craving and the withdrawal (WD) symptoms of substance abusers. Some WD symptoms are common to several addictive syndromes while others may be more specific. Addiction (pull) and compulsion (push) overlap and can occur sequentially or concurrently. Different addictions occur with varying amounts of pleasure at various stages. Prolonged exposure can enduringly reduce the urge and discomfort in OCD  and may help some other addictions. Conditioned cues are important and for lasting efficacy a therapist may need to know their details for each syndrome. There may be some similarities in the early management and prevention of relapse of behavioural and chemical addictions."

The results clearly indicate that crickets infected by the nematomorph Paragordius tricuspidatus are more likely to jump into water than uninfected ones.

It is assumed that thousands of years ago all people had hypolactasia in the same way as most mammals do today. At that time in cultures where milk consumption was started after childhood  lactase persistence had a selective advantage. Those people with lactase persistence were healthier and had more children than people with hypolactasia  and the frequency of the lactase persistence gene started to increase. The present prevalence of hypolactasia can be explained fairly well by this culture historical hypothesis.

The women responded to a second food frequency questionnaire in 1997. Main outcome measure Multivariable survival models were applied to determine the association between milk consumption and time to mortality or fracture. Results During a mean follow-up of 20.1 years  15 541 women died and 17 252 had a fracture  of whom 4259 had a hip fracture. In the male cohort with a mean follow-up of 11.2 years  10 112 men died and 5066 had a fracture  with 1166 hip fracture cases. In women the adjusted mortality hazard ratio for three or more glasses of milk a day compared with less than one glass a day was 1.93 (95% confidence interval 1.80 to 2.06). For every glass of milk  the adjusted hazard ratio of all cause mortality was 1.15 (1.13 to 1.17) in women and 1.03 (1.01 to 1.04) in men. For every glass of milk in women no reduction was observed in fracture risk with higher milk consumption for any fracture (1.02  1.00 to 1.04) or for hip fracture (1.09  1.05 to 1.13). The corresponding adjusted hazard ratios in men were 1.01 (0.99 to 1.03) and 1.03 (0.99 to 1.07). In subsamples of two additional cohorts  one in males and one in females  a positive association was seen between milk intake and both urine 8-iso-PGF2α (a biomarker of oxidative stress) and serum interleukin 6 (a main inflammatory biomarker). Conclusions High milk intake was associated with higher mortality in one cohort of women and in another cohort of men  and with higher fracture incidence in women.

This ‘shrub encroachment’ has been linked to livestock grazing  fire-suppression and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations facilitating shrub recruitment. Apex predators initiate trophic cascades which can influence the abundance of many species across multiple trophic levels within ecosystems. Extirpation of apex predators is linked inextricably to pastoralism  but has not been considered as a factor contributing to shrub encroachment. Here  we ask if trophic cascades triggered by the extirpation of Australia's largest terrestrial predator  the dingo (Canis dingo)  could be a driver of shrub encroachment in the Strzelecki Desert  Australia. We use aerial photographs spanning a 51-year period to compare shrub cover between areas where dingoes are historically rare and common. We then quantify contemporary patterns of shrub  shrub seedling and mammal abundances  and use structural equation modelling to compare competing trophic cascade hypotheses to explain how dingoes could influence shrub recruitment. Finally  we track the fate of seedlings of an encroaching shrub  hopbush (Dodonaea viscosa angustissima)  during a period optimal for seedling recruitment  and quantify removal rates of hopbush seeds by rodents from enriched seed patches. Shrub cover was 26–48% greater in areas where dingoes were rare than common. Our structural equation modelling supported the hypothesis that dingo removal facilitates shrub encroachment by triggering a four level trophic cascade. According to this model  increased mesopredator abundance in the absence of dingoes results in suppressed abundance of consumers of shrub seeds and seedlings  rodents and rabbits respectively. In turn  suppressed abundances of rodents and rabbits in the absence of dingoes relaxed a recruitment bottleneck for shrubs. The results of our SEM were supported by results showing that rates of hopbush seedling survival and seed removal were 1·7 times greater and 2·1 times lower in areas where dingoes were rare than common. Our study provides evidence linking the suppression of an apex predator to the historic encroachment of shrubs. We contend that trophic cascades induced by apex predator extirpation may be an overlooked driver of shrub encroachment."

We then test the effects of testes mass (postcopulatory sexual selection)  polygamy  seasonal breeding and intromission duration on the baculum in primates and carnivores. The ancestral mammal did not have a baculum  but both ancestral primates and carnivores did. No relationship was found between testes mass and baculum length in either primates or carnivores. Intromission duration correlated with baculum presence over the course of primate evolution  and prolonged intromission predicts significantly longer bacula in extant primates and carnivores. Both polygamous and seasonal breeding systems predict significantly longer bacula in primates.

Those flakes contain skin oils  including cholesterol and “squalene ” and are a major constituent of the dust that accumulates on tables and other surfaces in homes and offices. Past research suggested that squalene from passengers’ skin had a role in reducing levels of ozone — a pollutant that can irritate the eyes  nose and throat and worsen asthma symptoms — from the air in airplane cabins."

The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) software tool calculates whether a colliding asteroid experiences an airburst or surface impact and calculates effect severity as well as reach on the global map. To calculate the consequences of an impact in terms of loss of human life  new vulnerability models are derived that connect the severity of seven impact effects (strong winds  overpressure shockwave  thermal radiation  seismic shaking  ejecta deposition  cratering  and tsunamis) with lethality to human populations. With the new vulnerability models  ARMOR estimates casualties of an impact under consideration of the local population and geography. The presented algorithms and models are employed in two case studies to estimate total casualties as well as the damage contribution of each impact effect. The case studies highlight that aerothermal effects are most harmful except for deep water impacts  where tsunamis are the dominant hazard. Continental shelves serve a protective function against the tsunami hazard caused by impactors on the shelf. Furthermore  the calculation of impact consequences facilitates asteroid risk estimation to better characterize a given threat  and the concept of risk as well as its applicability to the asteroid impact scenario are presented."

Abstract: The treatment of triaminoguanidinium chloride with two equivalents of sodium nitrite under acidic conditions  followed by the cyclization with stoichiometric amounts of either sodium hydroxide solution or solid sodium carbonate yielded 1-amino-5-azidotetrazole (1)  5-azido-1-diazidocarbamoyltetrazole (2)  and 1-(aminoazidocarbamoyl)-5-azidotetrazole (3). The three novel compounds could be isolated by short-column liquid chromatography by using chloroform in reasonable yields. The mechanism of the formation as well as the decomposition pathway of the materials was investigated and a full characterization of all three compounds is presented. Compounds 1  2  3 have been characterized by means of Raman and IR as well as multinuclear NMR spectroscopy  mass spectrometry  and X-ray diffraction studies. Thermal stabilities have been evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Theoretical calculations have been performed to ensure the assignment of the vibrational modes obtained from Raman and IR measurements. The sensitivity values obtained from our measurements reflect the behavior of the compounds  which show an extremely high sensitivity toward mechanical as well as thermal stimuli."

This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system  as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss  so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface  where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed  it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels  by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate  concluding that deployment over 10% of the Arctic  especially where ice survival is marginal  could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic  using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multipronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system."

Previous efforts using this method found that electricity can be generated; however  electrical power densities were low  and expensive ion-exchange membranes were needed. Here  we overcame these challenges by developing a new approach to capture electrical power from CO2 dissolved in water  the pH-gradient flow cell. In this approach  two identical supercapacitive manganese oxide electrodes were separated by a nonselective membrane and exposed to an aqueous buffer solution sparged with either CO2 gas or air. This pH-gradient flow cell produced an average power density of 0.82 W/m2  which was nearly 200 times higher than values reported using previous approaches."

Findings  In this case-control study of 98 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 98 matched neurotypical control individuals  the neurobiological male phenotype was not associated with a higher risk for autism spectrum disorder than the female phenotype across the binary categories dictated by biological sex. Meaning  In addition to genetic and environmental factors  normative sex-related phenotypic diversity is not sufficient to explain the male preponderant prevalence of autism spectrum disorder. Abstract: Importance  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is 2 to 5 times more common in male individuals than in female individuals. While the male preponderant prevalence of ASD might partially be explained by sex differences in clinical symptoms  etiological models suggest that the biological male phenotype carries a higher intrinsic risk for ASD than the female phenotype. To our knowledge  this hypothesis has never been tested directly  and the neurobiological mechanisms that modulate ASD risk in male individuals and female individuals remain elusive. Objectives  To examine the probability of ASD as a function of normative sex-related phenotypic diversity in brain structure and to identify the patterns of sex-related neuroanatomical variability associated with low or high probability of ASD. Design  Setting  and Participants  This study examined a cross-sectional sample of 98 right-handed  high-functioning adults with ASD and 98 matched neurotypical control individuals aged 18 to 42 years. A multivariate probabilistic classification approach was used to develop a predictive model of biological sex based on cortical thickness measures assessed via magnetic resonance imaging in neurotypical controls. This normative model was subsequently applied to individuals with ASD. The study dates were June 2005 to October 2009  and this analysis was conducted between June 2015 and July 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures  Sample and population ASD probability estimates as a function of normative sex-related diversity in brain structure  as well as neuroanatomical patterns associated with ASD probability in male individuals and female individuals. Results  Among the 98 individuals with ASD  49 were male and 49 female  with a mean (SD) age of 26.88 (7.18) years. Among the 98 controls  51 were male and 47 female  with a mean (SD) age of 27.39 (6.44) years. The sample probability of ASD did not increase significantly with predictive probabilities for the male neuroanatomical brain phenotype. For example  biological female individuals with a more male-typic pattern of brain anatomy were equally likely to have ASD than biological female individuals with a characteristically female brain phenotype (P=.40 vs .55  respectively; χ21=1.11; P>.05; difference in P values  −.15; 95% CI  −.10 to .40). This finding translates to an estimated variability in population prevalence from 0.3% to 0.6%  respectively. Moreover  the patterns of sex-related neuroanatomical variability associated with ASD probability were sex specific (eg  in inferior temporal regions  where ASD has different neurobiological underpinnings in male individuals and female individuals). Conclusions and Relevance  These findings imply that the male neuroanatomical phenotype does not carry a higher intrinsic risk for ASD than the female neurophenotype and provide important novel insights into the neurobiological mechanisms mediating sex differences in ASD prevalence."

Such a common ABO3–type perovskite structure  most widely used for ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics  enables the same solid-solution material to be used for the simultaneous harvesting or sensing of solar  kinetic  and thermal energies. In this letter  the ferroelectric  pyroelectric  and piezoelectric properties of KBNNO with x=0.1 have been reported above room temperature.

As a result  a remanent polarization of 3.4μC/cm2  a pyroelectric coefficient of 26μC/m2K  piezoelectric coefficients d33≈23pC/N and g33≈4.1×10−3Vm/N  and a direct bandgap of 1.48eV have been measured for the KBNNO ceramics. These results are considered to be a significant improvement compared to those of other compositions (e.g.  ZnO and AlN)  which could be used for the same applications. The results pave the way for the development of hybrid energy harvesters/sensors  which can convert multiple energy sources into electrical energy simultaneously in the same material."

Climate driver informed short-term drought risks are evaluated for future time steps following conditioning on the initial state of climate drivers and initial reservoir storage level. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in eastern Australia. Simulations of future rainfall are provided by the climate-informed multitime scale stochastic (CIMSS) model  which is used to incorporate Pacific decadal variability exhibited by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation-Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. The climate driver informed drought risks are compared to a traditional approach that evaluates long-term drought risks using a nonclimate driver informed rainfall model. The case study considers four scenarios describing a range of different climate driver initial conditions. For the PDO-IPO positive initial state scenarios  the short-term risks are found to be higher than traditional long-term risks by 20%–100%. Furthermore  the elevated short-term risks can last up to 30 years with the CIMSS model but <10 years with the traditional model. The implication of these results is that traditional approaches can significantly underestimate the severity and duration of drought risk. The case study demonstrates a practical and general approach for incorporating the influence of climate drivers and initial storage conditions into drought risk analyses  which could be adapted to other regions and climate drivers. The results prompt a recommendation to water resource planners to carefully integrate climate variability over a range of time scales into water supply system planning and operation."

To design and fabricate bactericidal topographies effectively for various applications  understanding the bactericidal mechanism of NTS in nature is essential. The current mechanistic explanations on natural bactericidal activity of nanopillars have not utilized recent advances in microscopy to study the natural interaction. This research reveals the natural bactericidal interaction between E. coli and a dragonfly wing’s (Orthetrum villosovittatum) NTS using advanced microscopy techniques and proposes a model. Contrary to the existing mechanistic models  this experimental approach demonstrated that the NTS of Orthetrum villosovittatum dragonfly wings has two prominent nanopillar populations and the resolved interface shows membrane damage occurred without direct contact of the bacterial cell membrane with the nanopillars. We propose that the bacterial membrane damage is initiated by a combination of strong adhesion between nanopillars and bacterium EPS layer as well as shear force when immobilized bacterium attempts to move on the NTS. These findings could help guide the design of novel biomimetic nanomaterials by maximizing the synergies between biochemical and mechanical bactericidal effects."

Following a successive identical 6-week training period but comprising 120 min of additional exercise per week  CRF non-response is universally abolished. The magnitude of CRF improvement is primarily attributed to changes in haemoglobin mass. The potential for CRF improvement may be present and unveiled with appropriate exercise training stimuli in healthy individuals without exception. One in five adults following physical activity guidelines are reported to not demonstrate any improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Herein  we sought to establish whether CRF non-response to exercise training is dose-dependent  using a between- and within-subject study design. Seventy-eight healthy adults were divided into five groups (1–5) respectively comprising one  two  three  four and five 60 min exercise sessions per week but otherwise following an identical 6-week endurance training (ET) programme. Non-response was defined as any change in CRF  determined by maximal incremental exercise power output (Wmax)  within the typical error of measurement (±3.96%). Participants classified as non-responders after the ET intervention completed a successive 6-week ET period including two additional exercise sessions per week. Maximal oxygen consumption (urn:x-wiley:00223751:media:tjp12240:tjp12240-math-0001)  haematology and muscle biopsies were assessed prior to and after each ET period. After the first ET period  Wmax increased (P < 0.05) in groups 2  3  4 and 5  but not 1. In groups 1  2  3  4 and 5  69%  40%  29%  0% and 0% of individuals  respectively  were non-responders.

In turn  total haemoglobin mass was the strongest independent determinant of urn:x-wiley:00223751:media:tjp12240:tjp12240-math-0003 (rpartial = 0.49  P < 0.001).

One of the most recognizable vegetation patterns is the millions of circular patches  often referred to as “fairy circles ” within the arid grassland matrix extending over hundreds of kilometers in the Namib Desert. Several modeling studies have highlighted the role of plant-soil interactions in the formation of these fairy circles. However  little is known about the spatial and temporal variabilities of hydrological processes inside a fairy circle. In particular  a detailed field assessment of hydrological and soil properties inside and outside the fairy circles is limited. We conducted extensive measurements of infiltration rate  soil moisture  grass biometric  and sediment grain-size distribution from multiple circles and interspaces in the Namib Desert. Our results indicate that considerable heterogeneity in hydrological processes exists within the fairy circles  resulting from the presence of coarser particles in the inner bare soil areas  whereas concentration of fine soil occurs on the vegetated edges. The trapping of aeolian and water-borne sediments by plants may result in the observed soil textural changes beneath the vegetation  which in turn  explains the heterogeneity in hydrological processes such as infiltration and runoff. Our investigation provides new insights and experimental data on the ecohydrological processes associated with fairy circles  from a less studied location devoid of sand termite activity within the circles. The results seem to provide support to the “self-organization hypothesis” of fairy circle formation attributed to the antiphase spatial biomass-water distributions."

Empirical studies of historical ruptures worldwide show that earthquakes have ruptured through stepovers with this offset. Models of Coulomb stress change along the fault zone are presented to examine the potential extent of future earthquake ruptures on the fault zone  which appear to be dependent on the location of rupture initiation and fault geometry at the stepovers.

But the true “father” of the black hole concept was a humble 18th century English rector named John Michell–a man so far ahead of his scientific contemporaries that his ideas languished in obscurity  until they were re-invented more than a century later. Born in 1724  Michell attended Cambridge University and wound up teaching there for a time  before becoming rector of Thornhill  near the town of Leeds. He is described somewhat unflatteringly in contemporary accounts as “a little short man  of black complexion  and fat ” who was nonetheless “esteemed a very ingenious Man  and an excellent Philosopher.” For a small-town rector  he had some pretty impressive scientific connections: Benjamin Franklin  Joseph Priestley  and Henry Cavendish all visited him at some point in his career. Michell’s research interests spanned several areas of science. He started out looking into magnetism  demonstrating that the magnetic force exerted by each pole of a magnet decreases with the square of the distance. After a major Lisbon earthquake in 1755  he proposed that earthquakes propagate as waves through solid earth  thereby helping establish the field of seismology. He won election to the Royal Society for that insight. In the realm of physics  he conceived and designed the experimental apparatus later used by Cavendish to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory to obtain the first accurate value for the gravitational constant (“G”). And he was the first to apply statistical methods to astronomy. He studied how stars were distributed in the night sky and argued that there were far more “pairs” or groups or stars than would happen with random alignments. His analysis provided the first evidence for binary stars and star clusters. But it was a paper Michell wrote in November 1783 to Cavendish–later published in the Royal Society’s journal–that proved the most prescient. His intent was not to “invent” exotic objects  but to discover a useful method to determine the mass of a star. Michell adhered to Isaac Newton’s corpuscular theory of light  and since light was made of particles  he reasoned that when they were emitted by a star  that star’s gravitational pull would reduce their speed  producing an observable shift in the starlight. He thought he could measure how much the speed of light was reduced by passing it through a prism; it ought to be deflected differently because of the reduced energy. He could conceivably compare the refracted images of different stars to determine the difference in their surface gravity  and from that  calculate their respective masses."

For RCP4.5  the scenario closest to the 2 °C warming target for the climate change treaty  the range of cumulative emissions in 2100 from thawing permafrost decreases to between 27 and 100 Gt C with temperature increases between 0.05 and 0.15 °C  but the relative fraction of permafrost to total emissions increases to between 3% and 11%. Any substantial warming results in a committed  long-term carbon release from thawing permafrost with 60% of emissions occurring after 2100  indicating that not accounting for permafrost emissions risks overshooting the 2 °C warming target. Climate projections in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)  and any emissions targets based on those projections  do not adequately account for emissions from thawing permafrost and the effects of the PCF on global climate. We recommend the IPCC commission a special assessment focusing on the PCF and its impact on global climate to supplement the AR5 in support of treaty negotiation."

These rare multipotent cells occupy specific locations in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The specific microenvironment regulating HSCs  commonly referred to as the niche  comprises multiple cell types whose exact contributions are under active investigation. Understanding cellular cross talk involving HSCs in the BM microenvironment is of fundamental importance for harnessing therapies against benign and malignant blood diseases. In this review  we summarize and evaluate recent advances in our understanding of niche heterogeneity and its influence on HSC function."

The data presented are corrected for background contamination  which is primarily due to inner-belt protons in these low-L regions. We find that ∼1 MeV electrons were transported into the inner zone following the two largest geomagnetic storms of the Van Allen Probes era to date  the March and June 2015 events. As ∼1 MeV electrons were not observed in Van Allen Probes data in the inner zone prior to these two events  the injections created a new inner belt that persisted for at least 1.5 years. In contrast  we find that electrons injected into the slot region decay on much faster timescales  approximately tens of days. Furthermore  we find no evidence of >1.5 MeV electrons in the inner zone during the entire time interval considered (April 2013 through September 2016). The energies we examine thus span a transition range in the steeply falling inner zone electron spectrum  where modest intensities are observed at 0.7 MeV  and no electrons are observed at 1.5 MeV. To validate the results obtained from the background corrected flux measurements  we also present detailed pulse-height spectra from individual MagEIS detectors. These measurements confirm our results and also reveal low-intensity inner zone and slot region electrons that are not captured in the standard background corrected data product. Finally  we briefly discuss efforts to refine the upper limit of inner zone MeV electron flux obtained in earlier work."

Ionospheric scintillation represents a disruptive manifestation of adverse space weather conditions through degradation of the reliability and continuity of satellite telecommunication and navigation systems and services (e.g.  European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service  EGNOS). The purpose of the experiment presented here was to determine the contribution of auroral ionization structures to GPS scintillation. European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) measurements were obtained along the same line of sight of a given GPS satellite observed from Tromso and followed by means of the EISCAT UHF radar to causally identify plasma structures that give rise to scintillation on the co-aligned GPS radio link. Large-scale structures associated with the poleward edge of the ionospheric trough  with auroral arcs in the nightside auroral oval and with particle precipitation at the onset of a substorm were indeed identified as responsible for enhanced phase scintillation at L band. For the first time it was observed that the observed large-scale structures did not cascade into smaller-scale structures  leading to enhanced phase scintillation without amplitude scintillation. More measurements and theory are necessary to understand the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of large-scale to small-scale energy cascade and to reproduce the observations. This aspect is fundamental to model the scattering of radio waves propagating through these ionization structures. New insights from this experiment allow a better characterization of the impact that space weather can have on satellite telecommunications and navigation services."

In our experiment  we have expanded it by controlling for the sex of participants and of the learner. The results achieved show a level of participants’ obedience toward instructions similarly high to that of the original Milgram studies. Results regarding the influence of the sex of participants and of the “learner ” as well as of personality characteristics  do not allow us to unequivocally accept or reject the hypotheses offered."

Previous discussion of these reactions has focused on whether or not participants were distressed. We provide evidence that the most salient feature of participants’ responses – and the feature most needing explanation – is not their lack of distress but their happiness at having participated. Drawing on material in Box 44 of Yale's Milgram archive we argue that this was a product of the experimenter's ability to convince participants that they were contributing to a progressive enterprise. Such evidence accords with an engaged followership model in which (1) willingness to perform unpleasant tasks is contingent upon identification with collective goals and (2) leaders cultivate identification with those goals by making them seem virtuous rather than vicious and thereby ameliorating the stress that achieving them entails. This analysis is inconsistent with Milgram's own agentic state model. Moreover  it suggests that the major ethical problem with his studies lies less in the stress that they generated for participants than in the ideologies that were promoted to ameliorate stress and justify harming others."

Additionally it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats that are lost in the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats  monounsaturated fats  carbohydrate or protein. This review is part of a series split from and updating an overarching review. Objectives To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO)  polyunsaturated (PUFA) or monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity  using all available randomised clinical trials. Search methods: We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)  MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 5 March 2014. We also checked references of included studies and reviews. Selection criteria Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) not multifactorial; 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill  pregnant or breastfeeding); 5) intervention at least 24 months; 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available. Data collection and analysis Two review authors working independently extracted participant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm  and we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses  meta‐regression  subgrouping  sensitivity analyses and funnel plots. Main results: We include 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (17 comparisons  ˜59 000 participants)  which used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on how to reduce saturated fat. The included long‐term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.96  13 comparisons  53 300 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event  I² 65%  GRADE moderate quality of evidence)  but effects on all‐cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 12 trials  55 858 participants) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12  12 trials  53 421 participants) were less clear (both GRADE moderate quality of evidence). There was some evidence that reducing saturated fats reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (fatal and non‐fatal  RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 11 trials  53 167 participants)  but evidence for non‐fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; 9 trials  52 834 participants) was unclear and there were no clear effects on stroke (any stroke  RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 8 trials  50 952 participants). These relationships did not alter with sensitivity analysis. Subgrouping suggested that the reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies that primarily replaced saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat  and no effects were seen in studies replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate or protein  but effects in studies replacing with monounsaturated fats were unclear (as we located only one small trial). Subgrouping and meta‐regression suggested that the degree of reduction in cardiovascular events was related to the degree of reduction of serum total cholesterol  and there were suggestions of greater protection with greater saturated fat reduction or greater increase in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes on cancer mortality  cancer diagnoses or blood pressure  while there was some evidence of improvements in weight and BMI."

After printing and UV-curing  objects were soaked in a second network precursor solution and UV-cured again to create interpenetrating networks of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) and polyacrylamide. By varying the ratio of polyacrylamide to cross-linker  the trade-off between stiffness and maximum elongation of the gel can be tuned to yield a compression strength and elastic modulus of 61.9 and 0.44 MPa  respectively  values that are greater than those reported for bovine cartilage. The maximum compressive (93.5 MPa) and tensile (1.4 MPa) strengths of the gel are twice that of previous 3D printed gels  and the gel does not deform after it is soaked in water.

Horizontal crustal displacements can potentially track the spatiotemporal detail of mass changes with great fidelity. Our analysis of Greenland crustal motion data reveals that a significant excitation of horizontal amplitudes occurs during the intense melt years. We discover that solitary seasonal waves of substantial mass transport (1.67 ± 0.54 Gt/month) traveled at an average speed of 7.1 km/month through Rink Glacier in 2012. We deduce that intense surface melting enhanced either basal lubrication or softening of shear margins  or both  causing the glacier to thin dynamically in summer. The newly routed upstream subglacial water was likely to be both retarded and inefficient  thus providing a causal mechanism for the prolonged ice transport to continue well into the winter months. As the climate continues to produce increasingly warmer spring and summer  amplified seasonal waves of mass transport may become ever more present with important ramifications for the future sea level rise."

Slab constraints include subducted parts of existing Pacific  Indian  and Philippine Sea oceans  plus wholly subducted proto-South China Sea and newly discovered “East Asian Sea.” Mapped slabs were unfolded and restored to the Earth surface using three methodologies and input to globally consistent plate reconstructions. Important constraints include the following: (1) the Ryukyu slab is ~1000km N-S  too short to account for ~20° Philippine Sea northward motion from paleolatitudes; (2) the Marianas-Pacific subduction zone was at its present location (±200km) since 48±10Ma based on a >1000km deep slab wall; (3) the 8000×2500km East Asian Sea existed between the Pacific and Indian Oceans at 52Ma based on lower mantle flat slabs; (4) the Caroline back-arc basin moved with the Pacific  based on the overlapping  coeval Caroline hot spot track. These new constraints allow two classes of Philippine Sea plate models  which we compared to paleomagnetic and geologic data. Our preferred model involves Philippine Sea nucleation above the Manus plume (0°/150°E) near the Pacific-East Asian Sea plate boundary. Large Philippine Sea westward motion and post-40Ma maximum 80° clockwise rotation accompanied late Eocene-Oligocene collision with the Caroline/Pacific plate. The Philippine Sea moved northward post-25Ma over the northern East Asian Sea  forming a northern Philippine Sea arc that collided with the SW Japan-Ryukyu margin in the Miocene (~20–14Ma)."

Methods: Ten male subjects with ASD  ages 5–14 years  were matched by age  IQ  and autism severity into five pairs  then randomized to receive a single  intravenous infusion of suramin (20 mg/kg) or saline. The primary outcomes were ADOS-2 comparison scores and Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test (EOWPVT). Secondary outcomes were the aberrant behavior checklist  autism treatment evaluation checklist  repetitive behavior questionnaire  and clinical global impression questionnaire. Results: Blood levels of suramin were 12 ± 1.5 μmol/L (mean ± SD) at 2 days and 1.5 ± 0.5 μmol/L after 6 weeks. The terminal half-life was 14.7 ± 0.7 days.

The earliest known example of “prolonged” aurora sightings  with aurora persistent for two or more nights within a 7day interval at low latitudes  in Japan was documented on 21–23 February 1204 in Meigetsuki  when a big sunspot was also recorded in China. We have searched for prolonged events over the 600year interval since 620 in Japan based on the catalogue of Kanda [1933] and over the 700year interval since 581 in China based on the catalogues of Tamazawa et al. (2017) and Hayakawa et al. (2015). Before the Meigetsuki event  a significant fraction of the 200 possible aurora sightings in Sòng dynasty (960–1279) of China was detected at least twice within a 7day interval and sometimes recurred with approximately the solar rotation period of 27days. The majority of prolonged aurora activity events occurred around the maximum phase of solar cycles rather than around the minimum  as estimated from the 14C analysis of tree rings. They were not reported during the Oort Minimum (1010–1050). We hypothesize that the prolonged aurora sightings are associated with great magnetic storms resulting from multiple coronal mass ejections from the same active region. The historical documents therefore provide useful information to support estimation of great magnetic storm frequency  which are often associated with power outages and other societal concerns."

Secondly  Flesch readability scores were computed for the original and the revised abstracts.

Thirdly  academic staff and postgraduates completed cloze (comprehension) tests on original and revised versions of two of the original abstracts. The results showed (i) significantly higher cloze test scores for the revised versions  and (ii) that experienced staff and postgraduates performed significantly better on both versions than did beginning postgraduate students. Finally British and overseas postgraduate students of librarianship completed a cloze version of an original and its revised abstract. The results showed that the British students did significantly better than overseas ones  and that both groups scored significantly higher on the revised abstract.

During the Black Death pandemic  demographic and economic collapse interrupted metal production and atmospheric lead dropped to undetectable levels. This finding challenges current government and industry understanding of preindustrial lead pollution and its potential implications for human health of children and adults worldwide. Available technology and geographic location have limited previous ice core investigations. We provide new high- (discrete  inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  ICP-MS) and ultra-high resolution (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  LA-ICP-MS) records of atmospheric lead deposition extracted from the high Alpine glacier Colle Gnifetti  in the Swiss-Italian Alps. We show that contrary to the conventional wisdom  low levels at or approaching natural background occurred only in a single 4 year period in ~2000 years documented in the new ice core  during the Black Death (~1349–1353 C.E.)  the most devastating pandemic in Eurasian history. Ultra-high chronological resolution allows for the first time detailed and decisive comparison of the new glaciochemical data with historical records. Historical evidence shows that mining activity ceased upwind of the core site from ~1349 to 1353  while concurrently on the glacier lead (Pb) concentrations—dated by layer counting confirmed by radiocarbon dating—dropped to levels below detection  an order of magnitude beneath figures deemed low in earlier studies. Previous assumptions about preindustrial “natural” background lead levels in the atmosphere—and potential impacts on humans—have been misleading  with significant implications for current environmental  industrial  and public health policy  as well as for the history of human lead exposure. Trans-disciplinary application of this new technology opens the door to new approaches to the study of the anthropogenic impact on past and present human health."

With atom-wide motifs repeated in one dimension (1D)  they offer a privileged perspective into the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional systems. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide ideal environments for the creation of such materials. Here we present a comprehensive study of Te ENs encapsulated inside ultranarrow SWCNTs with diameters between 0.7 nm and 1.1 nm. We combine state-of-the-art imaging techniques and 1D-adapted ab initio structure prediction to treat both confinement and periodicity effects. The studied Te ENs adopt a variety of structures  exhibiting a true 1D realization of a Peierls structural distortion and transition from metallic to insulating behavior as a function of encapsulating diameter. We analyze the mechanical stability of the encapsulated ENs and show that nanoconfinement is not only a useful means to produce ENs but also may actually be necessary  in some cases  to prevent them from disintegrating. The ability to control functional properties of these ENs with confinement has numerous applications in future device technologies  and we anticipate that our study will set the basic paradigm to be adopted in the characterization and understanding of such systems."

Yet recent work on visual integration and change direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the details of our environment from one view to the next: we often do not detect large changes to objects and scenes (‘change blindness’). Furthermore  without attention  we may not even perceive objects (‘inattentional blindness’). Taken together  these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper  we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of ‘blindness’. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly  spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection  suggesting that observers attend to objects and events  not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment."

Openness is seen in the breadth  depth  and permeability of consciousness  and in the ongoing quest for new experiences and ideas. Although distinct from intelligence  it is related to divergent thinking and to creativity. Case studies of personality traits in geniuses  including self-reports from an eminent mathematician and biographer ratings of a groundbreaking musician  suggest that Openness alone of the five factors is consistently associated with genius. Systematic studies of representative samples of geniuses are needed to confirm that hypothesis."

Design Dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Data sources PubMed and Embase prior to June 2012 and references of relevant original papers and review articles. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Prospective cohort studies with relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of coronary heart disease or stroke for three or more categories of egg consumption. Results Eight articles with 17 reports (nine for coronary heart disease  eight for stroke) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis (3081269 person years and 5847 incident cases for coronary heart disease  and 4148095 person years and 7579 incident cases for stroke). No evidence of a curve linear association was seen between egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease or stroke (P=0.67 and P=0.27 for non-linearity  respectively). The summary relative risk of coronary heart disease for an increase of one egg consumed per day was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.15; P=0.88 for linear trend) without heterogeneity among studies (P=0.97  I2=0%). For stroke  the combined relative risk for an increase of one egg consumed per day was 0.91 (0.81 to 1.02; P=0.10 for linear trend) without heterogeneity among studies (P=0.46  I2=0%). In a subgroup analysis of diabetic populations  the relative risk of coronary heart disease comparing the highest with the lowest egg consumption was 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09; P=0.01). In addition  people with higher egg consumption had a 25% (0.57 to 0.99; P=0.04) lower risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusions Higher consumption of eggs (up to one egg per day) is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. The increased risk of coronary heart disease among diabetic patients and reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with higher egg consumption in subgroup analyses warrant further studies."

By measuring soil deformations around burrowing E. directus  we have found the animal reduces drag by contracting its valves to initially fail  and then fluidize  the surrounding substrate. The characteristic contraction time to achieve fluidization can be calculated directly from soil properties. The geometry of the fluidized zone is dictated by two commonly-measured geotechnical parameters: coefficient of lateral earth pressure and friction angle. Calculations using full ranges for both parameters indicate that the fluidized zone is a local effect  occurring between 1–5 body radii away from the animal. The energy associated with motion through fluidized substrate—characterized by a depth-independent density and viscosity—scales linearly with depth. In contrast  moving through static soil requires energy that scales with depth squared. For E. directus  this translates to a 10X reduction in the energy required to reach observed burrow depths. For engineers  localized fluidization offers a mechanically simple and purely kinematic method to dramatically reduce energy costs associated with digging. This concept is demonstrated with RoboClam  an E. directus-inspired robot. Using a genetic algorithm to find optimal digging kinematics  RoboClam has achieved localized fluidization burrowing performance comparable to that of the animal  with a linear energy-depth relationship  in both idealized granular glass beads and E. directus' native cohesive mudflat habitat."

The hypothesized sensory pathway begins with ocean water entering through cementum channels to a network of patent dentinal tubules extending from the dentinocementum junction to the inner pulpal wall. Circumpulpal sensory structures then signal pulpal nerves terminating near the base of the tusk. The maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve then transmits this sensory information to the brain. This sensory pathway was first described in published results of patent dentinal tubules  and evidence from dissection of tusk nerve connection via the maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve to the brain. New evidence presented here indicates that the patent dentinal tubules communicate with open channels through a porous cementum from the ocean environment. The ability of pulpal tissue to react to external stimuli is supported by immunohistochemical detection of neuronal markers in the pulp and gene expression of pulpal sensory nerve tissue. Final confirmation of sensory ability is demonstrated by significant changes in heart rate when alternating solutions of high-salt and fresh water are exposed to the external tusk surface. Additional supporting information for function includes new observations of dentinal tubule networks evident in unerupted tusks  female erupted tusks  and vestigial teeth. New findings of sexual foraging divergence documented by stable isotope and fatty acid results add to the discussion of the functional significance of the narwhal tusk. The combined evidence suggests multiple tusk functions may have driven the tooth organ system's evolutionary development and persistence. Anat Rec  297:599–617  2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals  Inc."

We present a predictive computational theory of the neural representations of individual events and states as they are described in 240 sentences. Regression models were trained to determine the mapping between 42 neurally plausible semantic features (NPSFs) and thematic roles of the concepts of a proposition and the fMRI activation patterns of various cortical regions that process different types of information. Given a semantic characterization of the content of a sentence that is new to the model  the model can reliably predict the resulting neural signature  or  given an observed neural signature of a new sentence  the model can predict its semantic content. The models were also reliably generalizable across participants. This computational model provides an account of the brain representation of a complex yet fundamental unit of thought  namely  the conceptual content of a proposition. In addition to characterizing a sentence representation at the level of the semantic and thematic features of its component concepts  factor analysis was used to develop a higher level characterization of a sentence  specifying the general type of event representation that the sentence evokes (e.g.  a social interaction versus a change of physical state) and the voxel locations most strongly associated with each of the factors."

Aim To systematically review the literature to establish the impact of acute exercise on markers of gastrointestinal integrity and function in healthy populations and those with chronic gastrointestinal conditions. Methods Search literature using five databases (PubMed  EBSCO  Web of Science  SPORTSdiscus  and Ovid Medline) to review publications that focused on the impact of acute exercise on markers of gastrointestinal injury  permeability  endotoxaemia  motility and malabsorption in healthy populations and populations with gastrointestinal diseases/disorders. Results As exercise intensity and duration increases  there is considerable evidence for increases in indices of intestinal injury  permeability and endotoxaemia  together with impairment of gastric emptying  slowing of small intestinal transit and malabsorption. The addition of heat stress and running mode appears to exacerbate these markers of gastrointestinal disturbance. Exercise stress of ≥2 hours at 60% VO2max appears to be the threshold whereby significant gastrointestinal perturbations manifest  irrespective of fitness status. Gastrointestinal symptoms  referable to upper- and lower-gastrointestinal tract  are common and a limiting factor in prolonged strenuous exercise. While there is evidence for health benefits of moderate exercise in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or functional gastrointestinal disorders  the safety of more strenuous exercise has not been established. Conclusions Strenuous exercise has a major reversible impact on gastrointestinal integrity and function of healthy populations. The safety and health implications of prolonged strenuous exercise in patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases/disorders  while hypothetically worrying  has not been elucidated and requires further investigation."

However  despite this attention  and unlike most terrestrial rocks  little is known on the abundance of individual phases within them. Here  we show how a combination of several novel X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques (including a high-brightness X-ray MicroSource®)  and Mössbauer spectroscopy  allows a complete modal mineralogy to be ascertained from even the most highly unequilibrated  fine-grained chondrites for all minerals of abundance >1 wt%. Knowledge of the modal mineralogy of a sample also allows us to calculate grain density. We analyzed Allende  Murchison  Tagish Lake  and Orgueil. Based on our modal data  the grain density estimates for Allende  Murchison  and Orgueil are close to literature values. In the case of Tagish Lake  there is no published grain density  although a bulk density measurement does exist. Taking our estimate of grain density  and the measured bulk density  we calculate an exceptionally high porosity of 41% for this meteorite  similar to some chondritic IDPs and in line with a porosity calculated from an entry model for the Tagish Lake fireball. Although it is an oxidized CV  magnetite is present in Allende at a level of <0.5 wt% or <0.3 vol%  a result that is substantiated by several other instrumental studies. This may be an oxidized meteorite  but that oxidation is not manifested in abundant magnetite. In addition  we note appreciable fayalitic olivine in Orgueil  detected by both XRD and Mössbauer. We employed MicroSource® XRD to look at heterogeneity in mineral abundance in Orgueil and found substantial variation  with phyllosilicates varying inversely with olivine. The data suggest that Orgueil was initially composed primarily of anhydrous materials  which have been partially  but not completely  altered. Although the data are preliminary  comparison between our XRD modal assessment  bulk chemistry  grain density  and Mössbauer data  suggests that our estimates of mineral abundance are robust. The advent of MicroSource® XRD allows similar modal data to be acquired from samples as small as a few hundred micrograms."

There were seven clinical trials that investigated psilocybin-assisted therapy as a treatment for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety  depression  and substance use. All trials demonstrated reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates. There were large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin may also potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in addiction  but the benefits of these two trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis. Psilocybin-assisted therapy efficacy and safety appear promising  but more robust clinical trials will be required to support FDA approval and identify the potential role in clinical psychiatry."

How to design an all-dielectric metasurface with sharp resonances by achieving interference between magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole modes of constituted nanoparticles arranged in a 2D lattice is shown. Thermal tuning of these resonances can cause drastic but reciprocal changes in the directional scattering of the metasurface in a spectral window of 75 nm. This change can result in a 50-fold enhancement of the radiation directionality. This type of reversible tuning can play a significant role in novel flat optical devices including the metalenses and metaholograms."

Our study compared the effect of ingested encapsulated placenta on maternal postpartum iron status versus that of a beef placebo. Methods A randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled pilot study (N = 23) was conducted among healthy human research participants experiencing a normal pregnancy. Maternal iron status was measured via hemoglobin  transferrin  and ferritin taken from blood samples drawn in the participants’ homes at 4 time points: the 36th week of pregnancy  within 96 hours of parturition  between days 5 and 7 postpartum  and during week 3 postpartum. Iron concentrations in the encapsulated placenta and encapsulated beef placebo were compared using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results Seventy-eight percent (18/23) of study participants’ hemoglobin concentrations were above the World Health Organization cutoff for gestational iron deficiency (≥ 11.0 g/dL) during the 36th week of pregnancy. Results revealed no statistically significant differences (hemoglobin  P = .603; ferritin  P = .852; transferrin  P = .936) in maternal iron status (including postpartum iron rebound in the first week postpartum) between women in the placenta supplement (n = 10) and placebo (n = 13) groups. Average iron concentrations were considerably higher in encapsulated placenta (0.664 mg/g) compared to the encapsulated beef placebo (0.093 mg/g) but provided only 24% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iron among lactating women based on the study's maximum daily intake. Discussion The current study suggests that encapsulated placenta supplementation neither significantly improves nor impairs postpartum maternal iron status for women consuming the RDA of dietary iron during pregnancy and lactation  compared to a beef placebo. This may be an especially important finding for women who are iron deficient postpartum and whose only source of supplemental dietary iron is encapsulated placenta  as this may provide an inadequate source of supplemental iron in cases of deficiency."

In 1998  as part of an innovative agricultural waste disposal service contract  an estimated 12 000 Mg of processed orange peels and pulp were applied to a 3 ha portion of a former cattle pasture with compacted  rocky  nutrient-poor soils characteristic of prolonged fire-based land management and overgrazing in Área de Conservación Guanacaste  northwestern Costa Rica. After 16 years  the experimental plot showed a threefold increase in woody plant species richness  a tripling of tree species evenness (Shannon Index)  and a 176% increase in aboveground woody biomass over an adjacent control plot. Hemispheric photography showed significant increases in canopy closure in the area where orange waste was applied relative to control. Orange waste deposition significantly elevated levels of soil macronutrients and important micronutrients in samples taken 2 and 16 years after initial orange waste application. Our results point to promising opportunities for valuable synergisms between agricultural waste disposal and tropical forest restoration and carbon sequestration."

Growth and biofilm assays show that HMOs from mothers of specific milk groups can modulate the growth and biofilm formation of GBS. High-resolution field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the quantitative biofilm assays and demonstrated cell arrangement perturbations in bacterial cultures treated with specific oligosaccharides. These findings demonstrate that HMOs affect the growth and cell biology of GBS. Finally  this study provides the first example of HMOs functioning as antibiofilm agents against GBS."

However  the motivations driving these allocations may represent either emotional concern for others (compassion)  adherence to social norms regarding fairness (politeness)  or both. In this article  we apply personality psychology to the study of behavior in the dictator game  in which we examine the discriminant validity of distinct pro-social constructs from the Big Five and HEXACO models in relation to allocations of wealth. Across four studies (Study 1: N=192; Study 2: N=212; Study 3: N=304; Study 4: N=90) utilizing both hypothetical and incentivized designs  we found that the politeness—but not compassion—aspect of Big Five Agreeableness  as well as HEXACO Honesty-Humility  uniquely predicted dictator allocations within their respective personality models. These findings contribute to a growing literature indicating that the standard dictator game measures “good manners” or adherence to norms concerning fairness  rather than pure emotional concern or compassionate motives  and have important implications for how this paradigm is used and interpreted in psychological research."

Between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013  12-month alcohol use  high-risk drinking  and DSM-IV AUD increased by 11.2%  29.9%  and 49.4%  respectively  with alcohol use increasing from 65.4% (95% CI  64.3%-66.6%) to 72.7% (95% CI  71.4%-73.9%)  high-risk drinking increasing from 9.7% (95% CI  9.3%-10.2%) to 12.6% (95% CI  12.0%-13.2%)  and DSM-IV AUD increasing from 8.5% (95% CI  8.0%-8.9%) to 12.7% (95% CI  12.1%-13.3%). With few exceptions  increases in alcohol use  high-risk drinking  and DSM-IV AUD between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013 were also statistically significant across sociodemographic subgroups. Increases in all of these outcomes were greatest among women  older adults  racial/ethnic minorities  and individuals with lower educational level and family income. Increases were also seen for the total sample and most sociodemographic subgroups for the prevalences of 12-month DSM-IV AUD among 12-month alcohol users from 12.9% (95% CI  12.3%-17.5%) to 17.5% (95% CI  16.7%-18.3%) and 12-month DSM-IV AUD among 12-month high-risk drinkers from 46.5% (95% CI  44.3%-48.7%) to 54.5% (95% CI  52.7%-56.4%). Conclusions and Relevance  Increases in alcohol use  high-risk drinking  and DSM-IV AUD in the US population and among subgroups  especially women  older adults  racial/ethnic minorities  and the socioeconomically disadvantaged  constitute a public health crisis. Taken together  these findings portend increases in many chronic comorbidities in which alcohol use has a substantial role."

Herein  we reported a Chinese traditional ink (Hu-ink)-based treatment for photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor metastatic lymph nodes. By simple dilution  stable Chinese traditional ink dispersion was obtained  which presents excellent photothermal effect because of its high absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. Meanwhile  as revealed by staining and photoacoustic imaging  Hu-ink could transfer to nearby lymph nodes after directly injected into the primary tumors. Under the guidance of dual-modality mapping  the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes could be subsequently eliminated by NIR irradiation. The good biocompatibility of Hu-ink has also been verified by a series of experiments. Therefore  the Hu-ink-based treatment exhibits great potential for PTT of tumor metastatic lymph nodes in future clinical practice."

Changes in the DC FDR vs neighboring Baltimore City were correlated to DC WLL (R2 = 0.72). Birth rates in DC also increased versus Baltimore City and versus the United States in 2004–2006  when consumers were protected from high WLLs. The increased births in DC neighborhoods comparing 2004 versus 2001 was correlated to the incidence of lead pipes (R2 = 0.60). DC birth rates from 1999 to 2007 correlated with proxies for maternal blood lead including the geometric mean blood lead in DC children (R2 = 0.68) and the incidence of lead poisoning in children under age 1.3 years (R2 = 0.64). After public health protections were removed in 2006  DC FDR spiked in 2007–2009 versus 2004–2006 (p < 0.05)  in a manner consistent with high WLL health risks to consumers arising from partial lead service line replacements  and DC FDR dropped to historically low levels in 2010–2011 after consumers were protected and the PSLR program was terminated. Re-evaluation of a historic construction-related miscarriage cluster in the USA Today Building (1987–1988)  demonstrates that high WLLs from disturbed plumbing were a possible cause. Overall results are consistent with prior research linking increased lead exposure to higher incidence of miscarriages and fetal death  even at blood lead elevations (≈5 μg/dL) once considered relatively low."

A significant body of theory supports this intuition: dynamic genetic polymorphisms are a common outcome of computer simulations of host–parasite coevolution. These in silico experiments have also shown that dynamical interactions could be responsible for high levels of genetic diversity in host populations  and even be the principle determinant of rates of genetic recombination and sexuality. The evolutionary significance of parasitism depends on the strength and prevalence of parasite-mediated selection in nature. Here I appraise whether parasitism is a pervasive agent of evolutionary change by detailing empirical evidence for selection. Although there is considerable evidence of genetic variation for resistance  and hence the potential for selection  direct observation of parasite-driven genetic change is lacking."

Methods: Participants consumed a diet for 9 days to deliver comparable percentages of protein  fat  and carbohydrate as their self-reported diet; however  dietary sugar was reduced from 28% to 10% and substituted with starch. Participants recorded daily weights  with calories adjusted for weight maintenance. Participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and oral glucose tolerance testing on Days 0 and 10.

Penis morphology of ducks is diverse  and penis length and elaboration are positively correlated with levels of male competition resulting from forced extra-pair copulations  and with female genital elaboration resulting from sexual conflict. Here we examined whether penis morphology is affected by social environment. We found experimental evidence that in a male-biased social environment  consisting of several males and fewer females  the penis in Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) grew longer in 2 separate years  than in males housed in pairs  as predicted if male–male competition influences penis morphology. In Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis)  males instead showed evidence of reproductive delays that were explained both by a male's size and his social environment: most males in social groups exhibited shorter penises  variable onset and duration of genital maturation  and faster penis growth rate. These 2 species have different levels of post-copulatory competition in nature  with Ruddy Ducks having more extreme penis sizes and more promiscuity than Lesser Scaup. The results suggest that waterfowl can exhibit complex  socially dependent phenotypic plasticity and reproductive maturation that can generate intraspecific variation in their genitalia."

The lightning enhancement is most prominent during the convectively active season  November–April for the Indian Ocean and April–December in the South China Sea  and has been detectable from at least 2005 to the present. We hypothesize that emissions of aerosol particles and precursors by maritime vessel traffic lead to a microphysical enhancement of convection and storm electrification in the region of the shipping lanes.

In the gas phase  the trianions are stable against spontaneous electron emission by 2.65  1.30  and 0.59eV  respectively. The chemistry of the stable trianions mimics that of Group15 elements. Abstract: Multiply charged negative ions are ubiquitous in nature. They are stable as crystals because of charge compensating cations; while in solutions  solvent molecules protect them. However  they are rarely stable in the gas phase because of strong electrostatic repulsion between the extra electrons. Therefore  understanding their stability without the influence of the environment has been of great interest to scientists for decades. While much of the past work has focused on dianions  work on triply charged negative ions is sparse and the search for the smallest trianion that is stable against spontaneous electron emission or fragmentation continues. Stability of BeB11(X)123− (X=CN  SCN  BO) trianions is demonstrated in the gas phase  with BeB11(CN)123− exhibiting colossal stability against electron emission by 2.65eV and against its neutral adduct by 15.85eV. The unusual stability of these trianions opens the door to a new class of super-pnictogens with potential applications in aluminum-ion batteries."

The uncertain meaning of friend status in these systems raises questions about whether and how sociometric popularity conveys attractiveness in non-traditional  non-linear ways. An experiment examined the relationship between the number of friends a Facebook profile featured and observers’ ratings of attractiveness and extraversion. A curvilinear effect of sociometric popularity and social attractiveness emerged  as did a quartic relationship between friend count and perceived extraversion.

After finding the occluded Sun with sunstones  its elevation angle had to be measured and its shadow had to be projected onto the horizontal surface of a sun compass. According to Ramskou's theory  these sunstones might have been birefringent calcite or dichroic cordierite or tourmaline crystals working as polarizers. It has frequently been claimed that this method might have been suitable for navigation even in cloudy weather. This hypothesis has been accepted and frequently cited for decades without any experimental support. In this work  we determined the accuracy of this hypothetical sky-polarimetric Viking navigation for 1080 different sky situations characterized by solar elevation θ and cloudiness ρ  the sky polarization patterns of which were measured by full-sky imaging polarimetry. We used the earlier measured uncertainty functions of the navigation steps 1  2 and 3 for calcite  cordierite and tourmaline sunstone crystals  respectively  and the newly measured uncertainty function of step 4 presented here. As a result  we revealed the meteorological conditions under which Vikings could have used this hypothetical navigation method. We determined the solar elevations at which the navigation uncertainties are minimal at summer solstice and spring equinox for all three sunstone types. On average  calcite sunstone ensures a more accurate sky-polarimetric navigation than tourmaline and cordierite. However  in some special cases (generally at 35°≤θ≤40°  1 okta≤ρ≤6 oktas for summer solstice  and at 20°≤θ≤25°  0 okta≤ρ≤4 oktas for spring equinox)  the use of tourmaline and cordierite results in smaller navigation uncertainties than that of calcite. Generally  under clear or less cloudy skies  the sky-polarimetric navigation is more accurate  but at low solar elevations its accuracy remains relatively large even at high cloudiness. For a given ρ  the absolute value of averaged peak North uncertainties dramatically decreases with increasing θ until the sign (±) change of these uncertainties. For a given θ  this absolute value can either decrease or increase with increasing ρ. The most advantageous sky situations for this navigation method are at summer solstice when the solar elevation and cloudiness are 35°≤θ≤40° and 2 oktas≤ρ≤3 oktas."

We report the discovery of a new optofluidic principle and demonstrate the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window. To generate a flow or stream in the same path as the refracted laser beam in pure water from an arbitrary spot on the window  we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous solution of Au nanoparticles. A flow will emerge from the focused laser spot on the window after the laser is turned on for a few to tens of minutes; the flow remains after the colloidal solution is completely replaced by pure water. Microscopically  this transformation is made possible by an underlying plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated cavity  which is self-fabricated on the glass by nanoparticle-assisted laser etching and exhibits size and shape uniquely tailored to the incident beam profile. Hydrophone signals indicate that the flow is driven via acoustic streaming by a long-lasting ultrasound wave that is resonantly generated by the laser and the cavity through the photoacoustic effect. The principle of this light-driven flow via ultrasound  that is  photoacoustic streaming by coupling photoacoustics to acoustic streaming  is general and can be applied to any liquid  opening up new research and applications in optofluidics as well as traditional photoacoustics and acoustic streaming."

Its asymmetric slow accumulation of strain and rapid release is quite unlike the harmonic motion of a pendulum and need not be time predictable  but still resembles a class of repeating systems known as integrate-and-fire oscillators  whose behavior has been shown to demonstrate a remarkable ability to synchronize to either external or self-organized forcing. Given sufficient time and even very weak physical coupling  the phases of sets of such oscillators  with similar though not necessarily identical period  approach each other. Topological and time series analyses presented here demonstrate that earthquakes worldwide show evidence of such synchronization. Though numerous studies demonstrate that the composite temporal distribution of major earthquakes in the instrumental record is indistinguishable from random  the additional consideration of event renewal interval serves to identify earthquake groupings suggestive of synchronization that are absent in synthetic catalogs. We envisage the weak forces responsible for clustering originate from lithospheric strain induced by seismicity itself  by finite strains over teleseismic distances  or by other sources of lithospheric loading such as Earth's variable rotation. For example  quasi-periodic maxima in rotational deceleration are accompanied by increased global seismicity at multidecadal intervals."

Based on geologic evidence in Bermuda and the Bahamas  studies suggest that during this period the North Atlantic was characterized by “superstorms” more intense than any observed historically. Here we present data and models showing that  under conditions of higher sea level  historically observed hurricanes can explain geologic features previously interpreted as evidence for more intense Last Interglacial storm activity. Our results suggest that  even without an increase in the intensity of extreme storms  cliffs and coastal barriers will be subject to significantly higher wave-induced energies under even modestly higher sea levels. Abstract: As global climate warms and sea level rises  coastal areas will be subject to more frequent extreme flooding and hurricanes. Geologic evidence for extreme coastal storms during past warm periods has the potential to provide fundamental insights into their future intensity. Recent studies argue that during the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e  ∼128–116 ka) tropical and extratropical North Atlantic cyclones may have been more intense than at present  and may have produced waves larger than those observed historically. Such strong swells are inferred to have created a number of geologic features that can be observed today along the coastlines of Bermuda and the Bahamas. In this paper  we investigate the most iconic among these features: massive boulders atop a cliff in North Eleuthera  Bahamas. We combine geologic field surveys  wave models  and boulder transport equations to test the hypothesis that such boulders must have been emplaced by storms of greater-than-historical intensity. By contrast  our results suggest that with the higher relative sea level (RSL) estimated for the Bahamas during MIS 5e  boulders of this size could have been transported by waves generated by storms of historical intensity. Thus  while the megaboulders of Eleuthera cannot be used as geologic proof for past “superstorms ” they do show that with rising sea levels  cliffs and coastal barriers will be subject to significantly greater erosional energy  even without changes in storm intensity."

Review of peer-reviewed literature. Main Outcome Measures. Findings on the associations between distinct sexual activities and various indices of psychological and physical function. Results. A wide range of better psychological and physiological health indices are associated specifically with penile–vaginal intercourse. Other sexual activities have weaker  no  or (in the cases of masturbation and anal intercourse) inverse associations with health indices. Condom use appears to impair some benefits of penile–vaginal intercourse. Only a few of the research designs allow for causal inferences. Conclusions. The health benefits associated with specifically penile–vaginal intercourse should inform a new evidence-based approach to sexual medicine  sex education  and a broad range of medical and psychological consultations."

College women viewed the Facebook profiles of four male students who had previously seen their profiles. They were told that the men (a) liked them a lot  (b) liked them only an average amount  or (c) liked them either a lot or an average amount (uncertain condition). Comparison of the first two conditions yielded results consistent with the reciprocity principle. Participants were more attracted to men who liked them a lot than to men who liked them an average amount. Results for the uncertain condition  however  were consistent with research on the pleasures of uncertainty. Participants in the uncertain condition were most attracted to the men—even more attracted than were participants who were told that the men liked them a lot. Uncertain participants reported thinking about the men the most  and this increased their attraction toward the men."

In two studies  participants were asked to quickly choose from a set of options before a randomly selected option was made salient. Even when they believed that they had made their decision prior to this event  participants were significantly more likely than chance to report choosing the salient option when this option was made salient soon after the perceived time of choice. Thus  without participants’ awareness  a seemingly later event influenced choices that were experienced as occurring at an earlier time. These findings suggest that  like certain low-level perceptual experiences  the experience of choice is susceptible to “postdictive” influence and that people may systematically overestimate the role that consciousness plays in their chosen behavior."

However  there may be pre-existing characteristics related to patterns of pet ownership and interactions with pets that could potentially bias results of research on HAI. The present study uses a behavioral genetic design to estimate the degree to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual differences in frequency of play with pets among adult men. Participants were from the ongoing longitudinal Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA)  a population-based sample of 1 237 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins aged 51–60 years. Results demonstrate that MZ twins have higher correlations than DZ twins on frequency of pet play  suggesting that genetic factors play a role in individual differences in interactions with pets. Structural equation modeling revealed that  according to the best model  genetic factors accounted for as much as 37% of the variance in pet play  although the majority of variance (63–71%) was due to environmental factors that are unique to each twin. Shared environmental factors  which would include childhood exposure to pets  overall accounted for <10% of the variance in adult frequency of pet play  and were not statistically significant. These results suggest that the effects of childhood exposure to pets on pet ownership and interaction patterns in adulthood may be mediated primarily by genetically-influenced characteristics."

The structure of Bk(IO3)3 consists of nine-coordinate BkIII cations that are bridged by iodate anions to yield layers that are isomorphous with those found for AmIII  CfIII  and with lanthanides that possess similar ionic radii. Bk(IO3)4 was expected to adopt the same structure as M(IO3)4 (M = Ce  Np  Pu)  but instead parallels the structural chemistry of the smaller ZrIV cation. BkIII–O and BkIV–O bond lengths are shorter than anticipated and provide further support for a postcurium break in the actinide series. Photoluminescence and absorption spectra collected from single crystals of Bk(IO3)4 show evidence for doping with BkIII in these crystals. In addition to luminescence from BkIII in the Bk(IO3)4 crystals  a broad-band absorption feature is initially present that is similar to features observed in systems with intervalence charge transfer. However  the high-specific activity of 249Bk (t1/2 = 320 d) causes oxidation of BkIII and only BkIV is present after a few days with concomitant loss of both the BkIII luminescence and the broadband feature. The electronic structure of Bk(IO3)3 and Bk(IO3)4 were examined using a range of computational methods that include density functional theory both on clusters and on periodic structures  relativistic ab initio wave function calculations that incorporate spin–orbit coupling (CASSCF)  and by a full-model Hamiltonian with spin–orbit coupling and Slater–Condon parameters (CONDON). Some of these methods provide evidence for an asymmetric ground state present in BkIV that does not strictly adhere to Russel–Saunders coupling and Hund’s Rule even though it possesses a half-filled 5f7 shell. Multiple factors contribute to the asymmetry that include 5f electrons being present in microstates that are not solely spin up  spin–orbit coupling induced mixing of low-lying excited states with the ground state  and covalency in the BkIV–O bonds that distributes the 5f electrons onto the ligands. These factors are absent or diminished in other f7 ions such as GdIII or CmIII."

Piezoelectric materials are employed in many actuating and sensing applications because they can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Although originally studied in inorganic materials  several biological materials including amino acids and bone  also exhibit piezoelectricity. The exact mechanisms supporting biological piezoelectricity are not known  nor is it known whether biological piezoelectricity conforms strictly to the criteria of classical piezoelectricity. The observation of piezoelectricity in protein crystals presented here links biological piezoelectricity with the classical theory of piezoelectricity. We quantify the direct piezoelectric effect in monoclinic and tetragonal aggregate films of lysozyme using conventional techniques based on the Berlincourt Method. The largest piezoelectric effect measured in a crystalline aggregate film of lysozyme was approximately 6.5pCN−1. These findings raise fundamental questions as to the possible physiological significance of piezoelectricity in lysozyme and the potential for technical applications."

Microbialites include domes  ledges and oncolites. Domal forms can grow to diameters and heights of 3m. Microbialites are composed of low magnesium calcite which is  to a large extent  precipitated due to the metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria Homeothrix and Leptolyngbya  and associated diatoms. Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide and triggers carbonate precipitation. Also  an elevated carbonate concentration in lagoon waters  derived from dissolution of Cenozoic limestone in a karst system  supports carbonate precipitation. Trapping and binding of detrital grains is also observed  but is not as common as precipitation. Bacalar microbialites are largely thrombolitic  however  stromatolitic sections occur as well. The bulk of Bacalar microbialites probably formed in the Late Holocene (ca 1kyr BP until present). According to 14C dating  microbialites accreted 9 to 8 cal kyr BP; however  these ages may be too old as a result of a strong hard water effect. This effect is seen in 14C ages of living bivalve and gastropod mollusc shells from Bacalar Lagoon  which are 8 to 7 cal kyr BP. The modern associated fauna of microbialites is characterized by low diversity and high abundance of the bivalve mollusc Dreissena sp. and the gastropod Pomacea sp. The abundant grazing gastropods presumably hamper modern microbialite formation. A comparison of Bacalar microbialites with other modern microbialite occurrences worldwide shows only a few patterns: sizes  shapes  microbial taxa  mineralogy  type of accretion and settings including water properties of microbialite occurrences exhibit high variability. A trend may be seen in the grazing metazoa  which are rare to absent in the marine and brackish examples  but apparently present in all the freshwater occurrences of microbialites. Also  freshwater examples are usually characterized by elevated concentrations of carbonate and/or calcium ions in the surrounding waters."

These advances are accompanied by the discovery of crystal- and outcrop-scale complexities previously obscured by low analytical precision. Single-crystal incremental heating resolves subtle  intracrystal isotopic heterogeneity  allowing for more-accurate 40Ar/39Ar eruption ages. The eruption ages of widespread volcanic ash deposits are critical for calibrating the geologic timescale  and thus their accuracy has substantial implications for the geologic  biologic  and global climate records. Complex distribution of 40Ar/39Ar dates in the deposits of supervolcanic eruptions requires rethinking the magmatic processes and their effect on the 40Ar/39Ar system  specifically the extent of cooling and remobilization during the decades to centuries preceding these events. Abstract Accurate and precise ages of large silicic eruptions are critical to calibrating the geologic timescale and gauging the tempo of changes in climate  biologic evolution  and magmatic processes throughout Earth history. The conventional approach to dating these eruptive products using the 40Ar/39Ar method is to fuse dozens of individual feldspar crystals. However  dispersion of fusion dates is common and interpretation is complicated by increasingly precise data obtained via multicollector mass spectrometry. Incremental heating of 49 individual Bishop Tuff (BT) sanidine crystals produces 40Ar/39Ar dates with reduced dispersion  yet we find a 16-ky range of plateau dates that is not attributable to excess Ar. We interpret this dispersion to reflect cooling of the magma reservoir margins below ∼475 °C  accumulation of radiogenic Ar  and rapid preeruption remobilization. Accordingly  these data elucidate the recycling of subsolidus material into voluminous rhyolite magma reservoirs and the effect of preeruptive magmatic processes on the 40Ar/39Ar system. The youngest sanidine dates  likely the most representative of the BT eruption age  yield a weighted mean of 764.8 ± 0.3/0.6 ka (2σ analytical/full uncertainty) indicating eruption only ∼7 ky following the Matuyama−Brunhes magnetic polarity reversal. Single-crystal incremental heating provides leverage with which to interpret complex populations of 40Ar/39Ar sanidine and U-Pb zircon dates and a substantially improved capability to resolve the timing and causal relationship of events in the geologic record."

Growing in cool nearshore waters along rocky coastlines  kelp forests offer some of the most productive habitats on earth  with high primary productivity  magnified secondary productivity  and three-dimensional habitat supporting a diverse array of marine organisms. Today  extensive kelp forests are found around the North Pacific from Japan to Baja California. After a break in the tropics—where nearshore mangrove forests and coral reefs are highly productive—kelp forests are also found along the Andean Coast of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests support or shelter a wealth of shellfish  fish  marine mammals  seabirds  and seaweeds  resources heavily used historically by coastal peoples. By about 16 000 years ago  the North Pacific Coast offered a linear migration route  essentially unobstructed and entirely at sea level  from northeast Asia into the Americas. Recent reconstructions suggest that rising sea levels early in the postglacial created a highly convoluted and island-rich coast along Beringia's southern shore  conditions highly favorable to maritime hunter-gatherers. Along with the terrestrial resources available in adjacent landscapes  kelp forests and other nearshore habitats sheltered similar suites of food resources that required minimal adaptive adjustments for migrating coastal peoples. With reduced wave energy  holdfasts for boats  and productive fishing  these linear kelp forest ecosystems may have provided a kind of “kelp highway” for early maritime peoples colonizing the New World."

We investigated sound production in the Gulf corvina (Cynoscion othonopterus)  a soniferous marine fish with a unique reproductive behaviour threatened by overfishing  to compare with sounds produced by other marine animals. We coupled echosounder and hydrophone surveys to estimate the magnitude of the aggregation and sounds produced during spawning. We characterized individual calls and documented changes in the soundscape generated by the presence of as many as 1.5 million corvina within a spawning aggregation spanning distances up to 27 km. We show that calls by male corvina represent the loudest sounds recorded in a marine fish  and the spatio-temporal magnitude of their collective choruses are among the loudest animal sounds recorded in aquatic environments. While this wildlife spectacle is at great risk of disappearing due to overfishing  regional conservation efforts are focused on other endangered marine animals."

This is the first study to provide evidence suggesting that full episodic false memories of committing crime can be generated in a controlled experimental setting. With suggestive memory-retrieval techniques  participants were induced to generate criminal and noncriminal emotional false memories  and we compared these false memories with true memories of emotional events. After three interviews  70% of participants were classified as having false memories of committing a crime (theft  assault  or assault with a weapon) that led to police contact in early adolescence and volunteered a detailed false account. These reported false memories of crime were similar to false memories of noncriminal events and to true memory accounts  having the same kinds of complex descriptive and multisensory components. It appears that in the context of a highly suggestive interview  people can quite readily generate rich false memories of committing crime."

Humans  however  are distinct from other living things in that we attach great significance to the aging process. Specifically  in Western cultures  we have an annual ritual to celebrate the day we were born—the birthday party. Thus  although the biological mechanism of aging is continuous and invisible  it is marked by discrete yearly celebrations. We examine the proposal that  in part due to its salience as a cultural ritual  children interpret the birthday party as playing a causal role in the aging process. Results indicate that young children understand certain important biological aspects of the aging process but exhibit confusion regarding others  including the causal role of the annual birthday party."

To fully comprehend the concept of birthday  children must grasp the relationship between the social occasion (the birthday party)  irreversible biological growth  and the cyclical nature of the calendar. The authors' findings affirmed that a child's early conception is wholly social and self-contained (birthday parties confer a new age) and that young children believe that age can be affected by multiplying or skipping birthdays. The mature conception is socially based  but it is integrated with additional conceptual subsystems: the irreversible and independent unfolding of biological growth and the cyclical aspect of time. This enables the child to go beyond a magical approach to birthday rituals."

In Study 1  we measured police officers’ subjective social status and had them engage in a stressful task during which we measured cardiovascular and neuroendocrine reactivity. In Study 2  we manipulated social status and examined physiological reactivity and performance outcomes to explore links among status  performance  and physiological reactivity. Results indicated that higher social status (whether measured or manipulated) was associated with approach-oriented physiology (Studies 1 and 2) and better performance (Study 2) relative to lower status.

A new 150m horizontal resolution bed topography/bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface  yielding major improvements over previous data sets  particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 ± 0.05 m  which is 7cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore  it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins  thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing."

Indeed  evolutionary psychologists have shown that women's mate choice mechanisms track many cues of men's genetic quality and ability to invest resources in the woman and her offspring. One variable that predicted both a man's genetic quality and his ability to invest is the man's formidability (i.e. fighting ability or resource holding power/potential). Modern women  therefore  should have mate choice mechanisms that respond to ancestral cues of a man's fighting ability. One crucial component of a man's ability to fight is his upper body strength. Here  we test how important physical strength is to men's bodily attractiveness. Three sets of photographs of men's bodies were shown to raters who estimated either their physical strength or their attractiveness. Estimates of physical strength determined over 70% of men's bodily attractiveness. Additional analyses showed that tallness and leanness were also favoured  and  along with estimates of physical strength  accounted for 80% of men's bodily attractiveness. Contrary to popular theories of men's physical attractiveness  there was no evidence of a nonlinear effect; the strongest men were the most attractive in all samples."
